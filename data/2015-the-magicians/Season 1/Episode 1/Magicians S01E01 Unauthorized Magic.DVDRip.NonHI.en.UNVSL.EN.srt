1
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,446
There you are.

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,613
You're late.

3
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,385
I have a school to run.

4
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,049
There are more important things.

5
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,484
It's always something
with you, isn't it?

6
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,757
It's always an emergency.

7
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,764
It's happening.

8
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,669
They're not even
at Brakebills yet.

9
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,803
I know. Get them there.

10
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,607
Pray that they get a
little something under

11
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,742
their belts before he
finds a way to them.

12
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,716
Your ability

13
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,983
to think that we have
the slightest molecule

14
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,456
of control over anything

15
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,719
never ceases to amaze me.

16
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,090
It's not that.

17
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,892
You have to try.

18
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,125
We.

19
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,030
Look, this is your
responsibility.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,466
You have to get them ready.

21
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,731
They're infants.
They know nothing.

22
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,274
Especially him.

23
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,369
I will do what I can.
And you know this.

24
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,976
I do know.

25
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,945
Here.

26
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,884
Just in case.

27
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,185
You do still have an eye
on our boy, don't you?

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,187
Yes.

29
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,820
Great. Great.

30
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,890
Not exactly.

31
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,997
Why not?

32
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,035
Where is he?

33
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,773
Wow. Nice trick.

34
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,739
Well, I'm sure
you're a hit at parties.

35
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:06,153
<i>I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling
raw I'm in the prime of my life</i>

36
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:16,154
<i>Let's make some music, make some
money Find some models for wives</i>

37
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:25,600
<i>I'll move to Paris, shoot some
heroin and fuck with the stars</i>

38
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,368
<i>So,</i>

39
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,768
<i>you think you're ready.</i>

40
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,114
I do. Why?

41
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,144
I feel better.

42
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,812
On admitting, you
reported you couldn't

43
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,255
concentrate, eat,
get out of bed.

44
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:48,352
You said the feeling of not belonging
anywhere was overwhelming.

45
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,897
It's not sleight of hand
if you're gonna use CGI.

46
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,992
Well, I'm sorry. That's
insulting to anyone

47
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,831
who's ever done any
kind of close-up magic.

48
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,565
And that you were the most
useless person who ever lived.

49
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,700
And now

50
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,937
you feel better?

51
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,036
It's the original version, the
Danish version, that... It's, like, dark.

52
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,673
It's, like, a hundred times better
because the Danish people...

53
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,083
They have a dark soul.

54
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,484
I mean, I get it.

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,183
Get...

56
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,220
You're a kid, and your
whole life's ahead of you,

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,816
and you have these notions

58
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,091
about what life is

59
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,591
and

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,098
what it could be.

61
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,131
But eventually, you
have to let all that go.

62
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,575
So that's what I'm going
to do. That's what I'm doing.

63
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,511
Um...

64
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,008
It's a part of growing up.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,106
You know, selling the
comic book collection

66
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,582
and getting serious.

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,380
Studying for an exam.

68
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:50,652
<i>I'll miss the playgrounds and
the animals and digging up worms</i>

69
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,524
because we're gonna
go climb this mountain.

70
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:59,923
<i>I'll miss the comfort of my
mother and the weight of the world</i>

71
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,134
<i>I'll miss my sister,
miss my father...</i>

72
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,732
You graduate soon.

73
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,570
And then?

74
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,256
Um, I'm supposed to have
a grad school interview

75
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,748
on Tuesday. Yale.

76
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,146
Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

77
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,829
Look, I've never
threatened to hurt myself

78
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,287
or anybody else.

79
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,815
So you can't make me stay.

80
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,088
Can you?

81
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,202
<i>"The Chatwin twins
and their older brother</i>

82
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,092
<i>"had been sent
to the countryside.</i>

83
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,727
<i>"From a young age, Martin
Chatwin had a gloomy nature.</i>

84
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:11,366
<i>"And to combat his melancholy, he
would lose himself in stories of wonder.</i>

85
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,065
<i>"So he knew that he
would have trouble</i>

86
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,418
<i>"convincing his
brother and sister</i>

87
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,775
<i>"that this was no fantasy.</i>

88
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,907
<i>"Rupert, wounded in the war</i>

89
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,883
<i>"and the first Chatwin to
put away childish things.</i>

90
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,956
<i>"And Jane, the family skeptic.</i>

91
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,741
<i>"This was Fillory,</i>

92
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,050
<i>"a land of magic."</i>

93
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,893
Rupert! Martin!
Have a look at this!

94
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,390
<i>"Martin thought
they needed Fillory.</i>

95
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,564
<i>"But, no. Fillory needed them.</i>

96
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,071
<i>"It is here that
our story begins.</i>

97
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,511
<i>"But be warned. This adventure
is no mere children's tale."</i>

98
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,753
Where'd she go? The, uh,
girl in the rainbow shorts?

99
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah, you just missed her.

100
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,249
And?

101
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,882
Not my type.

102
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:45,463
Dude, she was wearing a unicorn
T-shirt. She's clearly into fantasy.

103
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,196
But how would you know? You're
in here reading obscure fantasy.

104
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,532
And she's out there.

105
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,706
Honestly, like 73 of her

106
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,773
kind of waiting for you

107
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,688
to finish reading the books
you've already read 800 times

108
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,752
and come out of your room.

109
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,539
I'm about to. It's
just it's a first edition.

110
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,986
And I am looking at it one
last time before I sell it on eBay.

111
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,158
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this a
serious conversation?

112
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,318
Should I sit up?

113
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,295
I called you.

114
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,834
All weekend.

115
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,633
Where were you?

116
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,075
I was at my dad's.

117
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,978
I got angsty prepping
for the interview,

118
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,610
and I fled for the
magical hills of Jersey.

119
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,544
Don't judge.

120
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,382
I'd never.

121
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,657
Oh, my God.

122
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,430
My girl. My friend.

123
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,557
Have you no decency?

124
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,964
Not even a little.

125
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,765
Excellent. Three-way!

126
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,120
Okay, we have got to pull you
together. This is it, Quentin. It.

127
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,807
I'm still high. Okay, you
know what? Screw it.

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,008
It's only the alumni interview.
- Right.

129
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,914
And it's only Yale.
Right, lesser Ivy.

130
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,562
And, honestly, they probably take
anyone conscious for philosophy.

131
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,186
For philosophy,
conscious is a detriment.

132
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,587
So I'm good.

133
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,919
You're great.

134
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,392
You know, you can go. Hey.

135
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,263
I am the angel protecting
your future, Coldwater.

136
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,828
Tighten your shit.

137
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,537
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,978
Hello?

139
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:47,953
Um...

140
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,884
It's Quentin Coldwater.

141
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,128
For the grad school interview?

142
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,294
I don't believe it.

143
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,250
Oh, shit!

144
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,071
Well,

145
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,908
he's dead.

146
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,882
By the look of
him, he was a big...

147
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,317
I'm sorry?

148
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,512
Why? Did you kill him?

149
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,054
No. Jesus!

150
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,250
I was kidding.

151
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,254
Can we go now?

152
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,689
Let's go.

153
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,528
Wait!

154
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,427
I think he left
something for you.

155
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,099
Q, come on, let's go.

156
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,743
Whoa, look at that.

157
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,579
<i>Fillory and Further
Book Six, The Magicians.</i>

158
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,310
Look at the date. 1952.

159
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,578
All right, please.

160
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,779
There are five Fillory
books, Julia. Five.

161
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,719
Yeah, I know, Quentin.
Everyone knows.

162
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,223
There's always been rumors
of a sixth book that disappeared.

163
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,601
Yeah, and those are
just some stupid rumors

164
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,923
off a super-fan message board.

165
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,905
Come on, don't be naive.
Maybe, but maybe it's...

166
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,369
What, it's a very
special art project

167
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,456
that the dead guy made up?

168
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,309
Because... I don't know. You
wrote your admissions essay

169
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,426
on the glory of Fillory?

170
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,129
Come on, Q. Come on. What if...

171
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,899
No, you have to stop.

172
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,672
Stop what?

173
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,640
You can't run away
hard enough, can you?

174
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,041
What happened to giving
up on the Fillory crap?

175
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,741
You used to like Fillory.

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,184
Yeah, I liked it. I loved it.

177
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,412
You got me into it, Julia.

178
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,546
I learned magic tricks just to
keep up with you. It was our thing.

179
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,792
Yeah, it was our thing, and
it was fun, silly, nerdy bullshit.

180
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,487
And it got us
through high school.

181
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,072
I guess I'm just a silly,
bullshit nerd, then, huh?

182
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,041
Hey, I'm not saying that. Which
never seemed to bother you

183
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,785
until right around the
second you met James.

184
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,803
I know where you
were all weekend.

185
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,703
At the hospital.

186
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,106
No.

187
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,895
You feel exactly like
you did the last time.

188
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,371
Life is raw.
Everybody medicates.

189
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,211
No, life is starting.

190
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,375
For real.

191
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,928
Look, I am just saying that

192
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,217
you are good at so much stuff.

193
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,916
Pick something.

194
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,181
Please.

195
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,458
Start living your life.

196
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,134
Look, I got to go meet James.

197
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,603
I love you. Call me, okay?

198
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,268
Great.

199
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,204
Quentin Coldwater?

200
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,443
Uh-huh.

201
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,248
I'm Eliot.

202
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,146
You're late.

203
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,184
Follow me.

204
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,555
Uh, okay. Um, hey...

205
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,193
Where am I? Upstate New York.

206
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,024
Upstate? But I was just...

207
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,497
Hey. Okay, what is this place?

208
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,298
Brakebills University.

209
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,427
You've been offered
a preliminary exam

210
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,495
for entry into the
graduate program.

211
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,097
Am I hallucinating?

212
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,136
If you were, how
would asking me help?

213
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,677
Come on, or you'll miss it.

214
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,181
Late!

215
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,021
Be seated.

216
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:38,926
Welcome.

217
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,533
You may address me as Dean.

218
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,728
I know you have questions.

219
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,831
They will be answered in time.

220
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,004
Now your only job

221
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,707
is to pass the
examination before you.

222
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,144
Begin.

223
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,627
Sorry.

224
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,966
I know that. I know that.

225
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,283
Ah.

226
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,054
Please report to this next room

227
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,218
for your final
examination. Thank you.

228
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,253
Next.

229
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,491
Please report to this next room

230
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,556
for your final
examination. Thank you.

231
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,700
Jules.

232
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,003
Oh, my God. Q? Oh, my God.

233
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,843
How did you get here?

234
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,776
Well, I can't
really explain that.

235
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,336
No, me neither. It was so weird.

236
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,814
I went into an elevator,

237
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:03,959
and then I got
out of the elevator.

238
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,474
Thank God. Thank God.

239
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,362
"Thank God" what? No, thank
God that you're confused too.

240
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,287
I just started these
new meds today,

241
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,482
and I thought maybe...

242
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,583
Stop talking,
please. Stay focused.

243
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,827
<i>You've just been given an
examination of your magical aptitude.</i>

244
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,793
"Magical"?

245
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,766
We have reason to
believe you possess certain

246
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,564
nascent abilities.

247
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,831
Okay.

248
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,531
I mean,

249
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,367
I used to think that...

250
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,535
And perhaps you did at one time.

251
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,875
Regrettably, you
failed the written exam.

252
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,244
I'm here to prepare
you to go home.

253
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,842
What?

254
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,146
It's all right.

255
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,982
We'll provide an alibi
for your missing time.

256
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,715
That test was crazy.

257
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,847
Any sane person...

258
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,755
I mean, all the
questions kept changing.

259
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,919
- Be that as it may...
- No!

260
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,986
Don't you want students
who make actual inquiry

261
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,792
instead of just
accepting like sheep?

262
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,226
I'm sorry. Um...

263
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,770
Can I start over?

264
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,835
Please?

265
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,908
I can't just go to Yale if
I know this place exists.

266
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,810
Which is why I'm
going to make sure

267
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,440
that you don't remember a thing.

268
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,567
This won't hurt a bit.

269
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,069
Quentin.

270
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,867
Let's see some magic.

271
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,890
No.

272
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,568
Magic. Real magic.

273
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,130
Please.

274
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,337
Okay.

275
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,079
Quentin.

276
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,587
Do you like this place?

277
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,518
Do you have a gut feeling that

278
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,859
it's something special?

279
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,790
Do you want to go
back to Columbia?

280
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,429
That pointless,
miasmic march to death

281
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,992
you call life?

282
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,334
Family that never calls and

283
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,899
friends that don't
really get you

284
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,341
and feeling alone and wrong

285
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,336
until it crushes you?

286
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,308
No.

287
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:54,412
Then quit dicking around!

288
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,648
Stop it.

289
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,018
Do some goddamn magic!

290
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,719
I said, "Stop it!"

291
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,623
Oh! Oh!

292
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,957
Oh, my God.

293
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,397
Oh!

294
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,301
Holy shit. I'm doing this.

295
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,619
I wouldn't.

296
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,490
Playing with time is
such difficult magic.

297
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,960
You'll just make it worse.

298
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,326
Jane Chatwin.

299
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,624
From the books.

300
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,099
Make what worse?

301
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,069
And it won't stop him coming.

302
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,971
Who? The Beast.

303
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,678
You're in the school.
He's going to find you.

304
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,977
You're the one he wants.

305
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,540
You have to learn.

306
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,744
Learn what? What are you...

307
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,842
Look down.

308
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,645
You're on the garden path.

309
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,822
Stay on, The Beast
will kill you, kill everyone.

310
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,123
Step off the path or...

311
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,205
<i>Magic is real.</i>

312
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,308
But you've gathered
that, haven't you?

313
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,542
Have I?

314
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,108
Three-year program, graduate-level
studies, program begins immediately.

315
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,517
How did you find me?

316
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,081
Mmm. Globes.

317
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,215
Sense magic.

318
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,957
It's not always
right, so we test it.

319
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,760
How did my friend do? Julia?

320
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,559
I'm afraid she
didn't make the cut.

321
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,657
And my apologies
for the rocky road.

322
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,601
We certainly didn't intend
for Bob to die on you.

323
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,968
The alumni guy? Mmm-hmm.

324
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,097
He works for you? Mmm-hmm.

325
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,606
Was he murdered?

326
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,303
Snuck a box of Oreos.

327
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,803
Magicians can't eat Oreos?

328
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,871
Diabetics can't have Oreos.

329
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:14,114
And the paramedic who
gave me <i>Fillory Book Six?</i>

330
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,816
Right. A scout.
Freelance. Sort of.

331
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:23,059
Any more questions? I've
got another 24 of you today.

332
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,723
Um... Okay.

333
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,797
So be a Magician?

334
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,662
Is that illegal or...

335
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,616
Are you guys trying to
take over the world or...

336
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,337
This school exists for a
single and timeless purpose.

337
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,310
To reveal your innate abilities

338
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,846
and hone them to
the highest degree.

339
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,058
Now, what you do with it
after that is entirely up to you.

340
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,916
If you want to take
over the world, then...

341
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,886
We don't teach
that, but give it a go.

342
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,988
Quentin. I need an answer.

343
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,962
Friends and family will
be given the exciting news

344
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,730
of your early acceptance to a
prestigious master's program.

345
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,828
And with a little illusion work,

346
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,839
all their questions
will be answered.

347
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,035
Good. Now, your meds.

348
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,840
Quentin. You haven't
been depressed.

349
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,682
You've been alone.

350
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,443
And you are not crazy.

351
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,655
You're angry.

352
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,452
And you are correct.

353
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,685
Everyone,

354
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,017
everyone medicates.

355
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,724
Out there.

356
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,721
Here,

357
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,027
we hope you won't need to.

358
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,547
Um...

359
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,107
Are you my, uh...

360
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,184
What up, roomie?

361
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,362
Uh, hey. Okay.

362
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,399
Um, I had a notebook right here.

363
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,763
<i>Fillory and Further Book Six.</i>

364
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,231
And you what?
You think I stole it?

365
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,365
Some dumbass kid's book?

366
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,784
Why do you have all that
nerd-boy dragon porn shit, anyway?

367
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,003
Are you 12?

368
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,319
Quentin.

369
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,710
This is the interruption
you've been waiting for.

370
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,873
Hi. I'm Margo.

371
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,482
This is him.

372
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,218
Hmm.

373
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,121
He's not that cute.

374
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,390
So, first-years
live in these dorms.

375
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,486
Then, depending on your talent,

376
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,326
you go to the house
with your emphasis.

377
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,764
Or you flunk out. In
which case, bye-bye.

378
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,029
But you wouldn't care
because you won't remember.

379
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,795
Good morning, professors.

380
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,809
Physical kids. Telekinesis.

381
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:55,336
Move shit, lift
shit. Most can fly.

382
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,750
Also, magnificent partiers.

383
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,977
Do not come by our house

384
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,452
if you have anything important
to do the next morning.

385
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,753
Then there's illusions, healing,

386
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,619
nature, hmm,

387
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,160
knowledge.

388
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,833
Psychics. You
know what they are?

389
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,297
Losers.

390
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,605
<i>Okay, we heard that.</i>

391
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,338
<i>Eat shit, Eliot.</i>

392
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,073
Like I said.

393
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,843
What? Who are they?

394
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,388
Don't. You'll scare the child.

395
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,287
Maybe he should be scared.

396
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,723
You're so dramatic.

397
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,724
That is what's left of
the third-year class.

398
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,357
Were 20, now four.
No one knows why.

399
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,257
They're just gone?

400
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,266
Mmm, rumor has it, killed.

401
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,532
Or flunked or got bored.

402
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,507
Or died 16 perfectly
natural deaths. Whatever.

403
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,635
We all signed this waiver.
I hope you read yours.

404
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,578
It says, "Spellwork is
not unlikely to murder you.

405
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,582
"And if so, oh, well."

406
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,141
So stay on the garden path, kid.

407
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,242
Yeah.

408
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,221
Wait. Did you say
"the garden path"?

409
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,155
Yeah, enough maudlin blah.

410
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,456
Let's go find something
magic to smoke.

411
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,526
Mmm-hmm.

412
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,830
At the exam,

413
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:25,570
each of you did magic.

414
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,564
What was inside you was coaxed.

415
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,111
The question is, who
can grow this magic

416
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,373
into something more?

417
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,375
Who can be a Magician?

418
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,579
Alice, please.

419
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,672
Ooh, looks serious.

420
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,766
Please! An artist is at work.

421
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,295
The answer is yes.

422
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,060
Until you pass out, and
then again when you wake up.

423
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,229
Did you just read my...

424
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,896
Nah, it was just a guess.

425
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,989
Hey.

426
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,425
Ah, one of those every year.

427
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,558
One of what?

428
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,634
Overachiever.

429
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,866
Shy, yet knows they're
smarter than everyone.

430
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,531
Therefore, everyone hates them.

431
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,908
Yeah, Alice is, like...

432
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,205
I don't know how she does it.

433
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,746
That's Alice Quinn?

434
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,449
Yeah, don't bother
trying to compare yourself.

435
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,281
I heard she comes from a
whole family of Magicians.

436
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,482
It's good to be aware the
world is inherently unfair.

437
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:58,990
Act accordingly.

438
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,382
Hey, Alice.

439
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,223
Come join us.

440
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,491
Make some friends.
Take a load off.

441
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,134
Poor little magic girl.

442
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,987
Hey, Alice.

443
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,615
Look, my friends,
earlier, they were just...

444
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,456
Cruel? Unoriginal?

445
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,922
Yeah. Sorry.

446
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,059
Um...

447
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,000
Look, honestly, uh

448
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,197
it's my fault that
they said that.

449
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,267
They saw how jealous I am.

450
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,436
And you're the
best, it's easy for you.

451
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,774
No, I study.

452
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,677
Then you get it. I barely...

453
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,446
I'm terrified I'm
gonna get kicked out.

454
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,678
I need this place.

455
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,587
And I never had
friends or parents who...

456
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,656
Look.

457
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,193
My parents are
useless, crazy people

458
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,559
who never taught me
a drop of magic, okay?

459
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,640
So, if you think that my family
is some sort of advantage,

460
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,132
you've been misinformed.

461
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,677
There, is there
anything else I can do

462
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,363
to make you feel
better, or are you good?

463
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,518
<i>Sorry. I just got your email.</i>

464
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,808
Cell phone's aren't
working up here.

465
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,366
My fifth email.

466
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,003
<i>Sorry. I was working.</i>

467
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,037
<i>You just tell me
what you meant by...</i>

468
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:33,552
I mean, not herself. I mean
barely talks to me, not eating.

469
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,382
<i>She looks like a goddamn ghost.</i>

470
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,220
<i>She's not Julia.</i>

471
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:38,917
Why? What happened?

472
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,185
<i>If I knew,</i>

473
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,921
would I need high-and-mighty
mega-genius you back here?

474
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,382
It's her birthday. I'm
sure you forgot that, too.

475
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,126
<i>I'm throwing a party.</i>

476
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,862
Okay. Party, good. Oh, party?

477
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,963
We're coming. No, it's not...

478
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,283
Yeah, you go back out there
to the great big boring world,

479
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,333
you'll never find your
way back without us.

480
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,604
Trust.

481
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,407
So is it black-tie or...

482
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,287
This is super
risqué. Super risqué.

483
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,848
All right. Okay. What is this?

484
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,225
It is a screwnicorn.

485
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,094
Q. Holy shit. Back
from the wars.

486
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,165
Hey.

487
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,293
Hey. Hey.

488
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,862
Hey. Hey.

489
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,930
It's really good to see you.

490
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,803
You, too.

491
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,343
Yeah.

492
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,454
Scotch, neat.

493
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,257
Saw the balloons over there.

494
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,125
Happy birthday.

495
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,295
Or not.

496
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,596
Yep. So go jump
off a cliff. Thanks.

497
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,558
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

498
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,524
Who?

499
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:29,432
Brakebills. Say "What's
Brakebills?" and I will stab you.

500
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,230
Tell them to test me again.

501
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,871
How did you... Remember?

502
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,570
I don't know.

503
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,010
Maybe I'm a mutant.

504
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,176
Or maybe

505
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,749
I wouldn't let myself forget.

506
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,435
They'll just wipe
your memory again.

507
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,435
I should be there.

508
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,136
What happened to
"should be at Yale"?

509
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,988
That was before I knew
there was something else.

510
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,243
Who cares about business
school? Would you?

511
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,440
You have to be able to do

512
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,984
certain things. God!

513
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,287
Were you always this smug?

514
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,217
Watch.

515
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,943
You have no idea

516
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,141
how long it took me

517
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,979
to find a spell that was real.

518
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,312
Yeah, it's real. Yeah,
because I'm a Magician.

519
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,913
Not necessarily.

520
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,488
There's just stuff out there.

521
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,026
There's a lot of nothing spells

522
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,204
that people don't even
know they're doing.

523
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,505
You go online, and
there's a video of

524
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,740
George Bush they
keep taking down.

525
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,974
And he's drunk
and he's laughing.

526
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,523
He's making magic air ripples.

527
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,263
And your point is?

528
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,397
It doesn't mean
you have potential.

529
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,505
Ouch.

530
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,403
I'm sorry, but they would know.

531
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,512
No, they missed
it. I know that I...

532
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,741
No, you know that
you don't want to fail.

533
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,912
What?

534
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:27,878
It's not about that.

535
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,478
Are you sure, Jules? Because
you can do everything else.

536
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,654
It's really okay if
this is not your thing.

537
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,257
You're hurting yourself.

538
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,426
And you're not okay.

539
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,366
They cut off my life.

540
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,033
Your life is here.

541
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,715
We got to go.

542
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,121
How's my hair?

543
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,386
Good.

544
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,511
Ah!

545
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,831
Hi.

546
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,513
How does it feel to know that

547
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,520
I can do whatever I want to you?

548
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,763
Awesome.

549
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,465
I knew it.

550
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,641
What the hell was that? What...

551
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,604
What are you? Some
kind of crazy psycho rapist?

552
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:34,805
Hey.

553
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,179
No. No, I would never.

554
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,417
I swear.

555
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,021
I just needed to
see if I was right.

556
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,282
Oh, you thought the school

557
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,657
was the only place
to track the gift?

558
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,023
We've been watching
you for quite a while now.

559
00:38:58,703 --> 00:38:59,864
Who's "we"?

560
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,387
Um...

561
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:21,248
Hello? Do you need help?

562
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,230
What the...

563
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,973
Funny thing about Fillory.

564
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,209
You don't really
decide when to go.

565
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:48,515
It decides, if you deserve to.

566
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,282
You haven't listened, Quentin.

567
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,620
You stuck firm to that path.

568
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,159
It's going to kill you.
Do you understand?

569
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,819
No, I don't understand.

570
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,262
Stop talking, you child.

571
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,435
Look, I know you
like Brakebills.

572
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,402
I know you feel
you finally belong,

573
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,462
but that place isn't the point.

574
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,938
You won't be there long.

575
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,305
Shut up. This is a dream,

576
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,640
and you are a fictional
English schoolgirl

577
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,042
stuck in my head from a book.

578
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,512
You know I'm not.

579
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,311
Look, Brakebills is the first
place that feels right to me

580
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:21,251
that is not
literally a fairy tale.

581
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,719
Brakebills is a tool.

582
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,450
You feel right because you're
starting toward your destiny.

583
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,923
That's all.

584
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,722
Quit clinging.
Start questioning.

585
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,990
Seek real answers
that will help you fight.

586
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,292
All right, back off.

587
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,367
I know that symbol. What is it?

588
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,537
Find out, won't you?

589
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,156
Uh, hey, you were
looking for something

590
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,694
in the cafe the other day.

591
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,272
There was a page
with a symbol. Go away.

592
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,855
Wait.

593
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,661
What does that mean?

594
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,430
How did you get this?

595
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,498
I'll tell you if you tell me.

596
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,076
Okay, fine.

597
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,776
Tonight, 10:00 p.m. Meet
me at the Admin Building.

598
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,797
And bring an
Estonian-English dictionary.

599
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,084
What does it mean?

600
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,024
"Contact the other side."

601
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,122
The other side? What
is it, like, séance shit?

602
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,244
Summoning,
technically, but, yes.

603
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,576
Right. Summoning,
of course. Yeah.

604
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,000
When I'm trying
to contact the dead,

605
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,003
I like to summon them
whenever possible.

606
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,433
Yeah, that's the plan.

607
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,682
As soon as we get
the book that I need

608
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,718
that apparently got pulled
off the shelves two years ago.

609
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,074
Pulled? Is it locked up?

610
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,420
It's in the Dean's
private collection.

611
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,044
Which means it needs
to be stolen, right?

612
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,712
Okay. Uh...

613
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,442
Look, I really, I don't
want to get kicked out.

614
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,229
And I really don't
want to be the guy

615
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,017
who dies in the first
10 minutes of the movie

616
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,265
because he's like,
"You know what?

617
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,689
"Let's take out
the Ouija board."

618
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,192
What could possibly go wrong?

619
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,371
Do you want to cheat off my
labs, huh? Do you want a tutor?

620
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,515
Do you want to get straight
As? I can do that for you.

621
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,698
So just help me with this.

622
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,730
Okay, for some reason,
you're involved, so be involved.

623
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:41,691
Hey, <i>étude</i> number
eight. Left or right hand?

624
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,497
Yo, pacey, what's your deal?

625
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,825
Nothing.

626
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,267
Look, hold that thought, okay?

627
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,039
I got to... Got to what?

628
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,506
Hey, I'm all ears.

629
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,443
Penny, don't be a douche. What?

630
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,812
I can...

631
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,013
Look, I hear voices.

632
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,180
What, psychic?

633
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,280
No, God, I hate that word.

634
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,253
Okay, mind slut?

635
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,356
Come on, Penny, you're
not the first I've met.

636
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,498
I mean, you're not even the
first to get in my pants, so...

637
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,929
Look, I got to go
somewhere, all right?

638
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,096
I'm obviously coming with you.

639
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,278
God.

640
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,886
Great, well, that makes me
feel a whole lot less nervous.

641
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,258
Nut up, will you?

642
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:50,604
There's no such
thing as safe magic.

643
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,891
You should know that, Quentin.

644
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,831
Might as well take a risk.

645
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,591
Great, well, if you
put it like that...

646
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:59,427
Who are we trying to contact?
It says we need a name.

647
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,965
Charlie.

648
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,805
And who's Charlie? My brother.

649
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,445
He died. It'd be nice to say hi.

650
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,574
What?

651
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,782
How did he die?

652
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,115
Horribly, I assume.

653
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:18,546
Since no one will tell
me what happened.

654
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,060
All I know is that
it happened here

655
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,460
at Brakebills five years ago.

656
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,145
Did you think that I
came here because

657
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,999
I just love magic so much?

658
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:34,699
No.

659
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,868
I need an answer.

660
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,473
He deserves that.

661
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:41,658
So can we just concentrate?

662
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,712
We need to get this done
by exactly midnight, okay?

663
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,310
Sorry. I mean...

664
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,185
To hear that. I mean...

665
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:51,489
Shit. No.

666
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,414
What? No, this is good.

667
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,050
This is all making sense.

668
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,352
Yeah. No, it is.

669
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,055
It's just... We can do this.

670
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,529
It's just we can't do this.

671
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,036
Oh.

672
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,729
Hi.

673
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,904
So... You got to be kidding me.

674
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:14,955
We were sent here
to help these losers?

675
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:15,979
Sent?

676
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,511
Wait. Who sent you? No one.

677
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:21,350
Look, I gather you guys need
some extra hands or something.

678
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:25,389
Yes, I can. Yes, I have.

679
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,482
Yes, everything you
think is so boring,

680
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,390
I replace it with dubstep.

681
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,018
What's dubstep?

682
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,455
It says we need four people.

683
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,190
"Each one a Magical Adept."

684
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,229
And here they are.

685
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,739
Please, come sit down.

686
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,407
This is perfect timing.

687
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,170
Well...

688
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,311
I'm hungry.

689
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,783
What? I am.

690
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,321
Let us know if
shit gets exciting.

691
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,571
I guess I'll start cleaning up.

692
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:33,514
A few helpful rules.
Don't demand, ask.

693
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,583
Safety first. Be patient.

694
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,084
Nobody levels up in a day.

695
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,387
And don't leave your
purse lying around.

696
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,017
And this is what exactly?

697
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,824
This is the real world, babe.

698
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,404
Always pay close
attention to the alloys.

699
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,447
Um, iron has a neutral quality,

700
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:07,314
whereas silver and gold
have the effect of, uh,

701
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,387
magnifying the effects of
other components of the alloy

702
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:12,420
and I would caution
you to test for this

703
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,891
each time before, uh,
using a knife for, uh,

704
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,090
ritual work because, um,

705
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,456
a spell can alter the metal

706
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,797
at a quantum level.

707
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,630
<i>Die Quantenstufe?</i>

708
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,431
<i>Wer sagt, dass alle
verschwinden müssen?</i>

709
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,771
<i>Wer weiß, möglicherweise, der
Flug des Vogels, den Sie verletzten?</i>

710
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,010
From the, uh,

711
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:43,576
famous German
poet and, um, wizard.

712
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:48,757
<i>Rilke. Und möglicherweise
überleben Blumen.</i>

713
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:04,030
So, for instance,
um, this first device...

714
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,723
Quentin Coldwater.

715
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,016
There you are.
