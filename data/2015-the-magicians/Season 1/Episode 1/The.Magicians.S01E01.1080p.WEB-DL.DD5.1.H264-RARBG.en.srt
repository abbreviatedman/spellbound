1
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,552
- There you are.

2
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,388
- You're late.
- I have a school to run.

3
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,323
- There are
more important things.

4
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,492
- It's always something
with you, isn't it?

5
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,729
It's always an emergency.

6
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,131
- It's happening.

7
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,408
- They're not even
at Brakebills yet.

8
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,211
- I know.
- Get them there.

9
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,847
Pray that they get a little
something under their belts

10
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,216
before he finds a way to them.

11
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,319
- Your ability to think

12
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,555
that we have the slightest
molecule of control

13
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,157
over anything
never ceases to amaze me.

14
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,827
- It's not that.

15
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,628
I have to try.

16
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,430
-<i> We.</i>

17
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,165
- Look, this is
your responsibility.

18
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,434
You have to get them ready.
They're infants.

19
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,437
They know nothing, especially...

20
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,773
Especially him.

21
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,609
- I will do what I can,

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,378
and you know this.

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
- I do know.

24
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,250
Here...

25
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,319
just in case.

26
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,424
You do still have
an eye on our boy, don't you?

27
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,826
- Yes.

28
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,229
- Great. Great.

29
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,531
- Not exactly.

30
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,832
- Why not?

31
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,868
Where is he?

32
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,705
- Wow.
- Nice trick.

33
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,543
Well, I'm sure
you're a hit at parties.

34
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,375
<i>- So...</i>

35
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,578
<i>you think you're ready.</i>

36
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,514
- I do.
- Why?

37
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,282
- I feel better.

38
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,588
- On admitting, you reported
you couldn't concentrate,

39
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,989
eat, get out of bed.

40
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,724
You said the feeling

41
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,594
of not belonging anywhere
was overwhelming.

42
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,230
- It's not sleight of hand
if you're gonna use CGI.

43
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,698
Well, I'm sorry.
It's just...

44
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,299
That's insulting
to anyone who's ever done

45
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,701
any kind
of close-up magic, so...

46
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,302
- And that you were
the most useless person

47
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,304
who ever lived.

48
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,741
And now...
you feel better?

49
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,610
- It's the original version,
the Danish version,

50
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,877
that it's, like... it's dark.

51
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,679
It's, like, 100 times better

52
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,649
because the Danish people,
they're... they're, uh...

53
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,850
they have a dark soul.

54
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,652
I mean, I get it.

55
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,255
- Get...?

56
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,990
- You're a kid, and your
whole life's ahead of you,

57
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,958
and you have these notions...

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,395
about what life is...

59
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,531
and...

60
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,700
what it could be.

61
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,470
But eventually
you have to let all that go.

62
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,474
So that's what I'm...
That's what I'm going to do.

63
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,476
That's what I'm doing.

64
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,345
Um, it's a part of growing up...

65
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,747
You know, selling
the comic-book collection

66
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,415
and getting serious.

67
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,007
- You graduate soon.

68
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,511
- And then?
- Um, I'm supposed to have

69
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,380
a grad-school interview
on Tuesday... Yale.

70
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,450
- Quentin, I'd really recommend
further treatment.

71
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,320
- Look, I've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else.

72
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,457
So you can't make me stay.

73
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,460
Can you?

74
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,990
<i>The Chatwin Twins
and their older brother</i>

75
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,826
<i>had been sent
to the countryside.</i>

76
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,728
<i>From a young age,</i>

77
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,564
<i>Martin Chatwin
had a gloomy nature.</i>

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,667
<i>And to combat his melancholy,</i>

79
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,670
<i>he would lose himself
in stories of wonder.</i>

80
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,673
<i>So he knew that he
would have trouble convincing</i>

81
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,676
<i>his brother and sister
that this was no fantasy.</i>

82
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,046
<i>Rupert, wounded in the war</i>

83
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,815
<i>and the first Chatwin
to put away childish things...</i>

84
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:32,424
<i>And Jane, the family skeptic.</i>

85
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,714
<i>This was Fillory.</i>

86
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,619
<i>A land of magic.</i>

87
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,894
- Rupert! Martin!
- Have a look at this!

88
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:13,098
<i>- Martin thought
they needed Fillory...</i>

89
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,569
<i>but, no, Fillory needed them.</i>

90
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,739
<i>It is here
that our story begins,</i>

91
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,874
<i>but be warned...</i>

92
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,610
<i>This adventure
is no mere children's tale.</i>

93
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,484
- Where'd she go?

94
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,953
The, uh... the girl
in the rainbow shorts?

95
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,488
- Yeah, you just missed her.

96
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,490
- And?

97
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,492
- Not my type.

98
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,628
- Dude, she was wearing
a unicorn T-shirt.

99
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,163
She's clearly into fantasy.

100
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,631
But how would you know?

101
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,000
You're in here reading
obscure fantasy,

102
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,236
and she's out there.

103
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:55,040
Honestly, like, 73 of her...

104
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,909
kind of waiting for you
to finish reading the books

105
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,889
you've already read 800 times
and come out of your room.

106
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,813
- I'm about to.
- It's just it's a first edition,

107
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,484
and I am looking at it
one last time

108
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,252
before I sell it on eBay.

109
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,090
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this a serious conversation?

110
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,992
Should I sit up?

111
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,568
- I called you...

112
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,036
all weekend.

113
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,573
Where were you?

114
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,242
- I was at my dad's.

115
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,244
I got angsty
prepping for the interview,

116
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,945
and I...

117
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,547
I fled...

118
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,917
for the magical hills of Jersey.

119
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,919
Don't judge.

120
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,554
- I'd never.

121
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,292
- Oh, my God.

122
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,762
My girl. My friend.

123
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,765
- Have you no decency?
- Not even a little.

124
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,067
- Excellent.
- Three-way!

125
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,536
No, no, no, no!

126
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,008
- Okay, we have got
to pull you together.

127
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,076
- This is it, Quentin. It.
- I'm still high.

128
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,945
I just...
Okay, you know what? Screw it.

129
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,880
- It's only the alumni interview.
- Right.

130
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,082
- And it's only Yale.
- Right, lesser Ivy.

131
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,884
- And, honestly, they probably
take anyone conscious

132
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,185
for philosophy.

133
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,654
- For philosophy,
"conscious" is a detriment.

134
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,323
- So I'm good.
- You're great.

135
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,899
- You know, you can go.
- Hey.

136
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,036
I am the angel protecting
your future, Coldwater.

137
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,005
Tighten your shit.

138
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,308
- Yes, ma'am.

139
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,650
- Hello?

140
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,887
- Um...

141
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,292
It's Quentin Coldwater

142
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,262
for the grad-school interview?

143
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,604
I don't believe it.

144
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,149
- Oh, shit!

145
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,410
- Well...

146
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,079
he's dead.

147
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,182
By the look of him,
he was a big...

148
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,418
- I'm sorry?
- Why? Did you kill him?

149
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,787
- No. Jesus.

150
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,789
- I was kidding.

151
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,258
- Um, can we go now?

152
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,261
Let's go.

153
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,365
- Wait!

154
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,401
I think he left
something for you.

155
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,837
- Q, come on, let's go.

156
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,344
- Whoa, look at that.

157
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,713
"Fillory and Further,
Book Six: The Magicians."

158
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,816
- Look at the date... 1952.
- All right, please.

159
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,352
- There are five
Fillory books, Julia... five.

160
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,154
- Yeah, I-I know, Quentin.
- Everyone knows.

161
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,222
- There's always been rumors of
a sixth book that disappeared.

162
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,857
- Yeah, and those
are just some stupid rumors

163
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,459
off a super-fan message board.

164
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,061
- Come on, don't be naive.
- Maybe, but maybe it's...

165
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,328
- What, it's a very special
art project

166
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,463
that the dead guy made up?

167
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,198
'Cause I don't know...

168
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
You wrote your admissions essay
on the glory of Fillory?

169
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,702
- Come on, Q.
- Come on. What if...

170
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,136
- No! You have to stop!

171
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,705
- Stop what?

172
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,840
- You can't run away
hard enough, can you?

173
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:53,211
What happened to giving up
on the Fillory crap?

174
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,714
- You used to like Fillory.

175
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,982
Yeah, I liked it.

176
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,884
- I loved it...
- You got me into it, Julia!

177
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,053
I learned magic tricks
just to keep up with you.

178
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,922
It was our thing.

179
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,223
- Yeah, it was our thing,

180
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,158
and it was fun,
silly, nerdy bullshit,

181
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,860
and it got us
through high school.

182
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,395
- I guess I'm just a silly,
bullshit nerd, then, huh?

183
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,496
- Hey, I'm not saying...

184
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,931
- Which never seemed
to bother you

185
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,166
until right around the second
you met James.

186
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,469
- I know where you were
all weekend...

187
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,971
At the hospital.

188
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,406
- No.

189
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,343
- You feel exactly
like you did the last time.

190
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,512
- Life is raw.
- Everybody medicates.

191
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,982
- No, life is starting...
- for real.

192
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,485
Look, I am just saying
that you are good

193
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,487
at so much stuff.

194
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,489
Pick something...

195
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,257
please.

196
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,259
Start living your life.

197
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,333
Look, I got to go meet James.

198
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,239
I love you.
Call me, okay?

199
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,973
Great.

200
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,373
- Quentin Coldwater?

201
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,510
- Uh-huh.

202
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,982
- I'm Eliot.

203
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,251
You're late.

204
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,219
Follow me.

205
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,723
- Uh, okay.
- Um, hey...

206
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,659
- Di... Where am I?
- Upstate New York.

207
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,528
- Upstate, but I was just...

208
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,029
Hey.

209
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,165
Okay, what... what
is this place?

210
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,033
- Brakebills University.

211
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,336
You've been offered
a preliminary exam for entry

212
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,071
into the graduate program.

213
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,206
- Am I hallucinating?

214
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,577
- If you were,
how would asking me help?

215
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,648
Come on, or you'll miss it.

216
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,121
- Late!

217
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,689
Be seated.

218
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,530
Welcome.

219
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:44,135
You may address me as Dean.

220
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,670
I know you have questions.

221
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,272
They will be answered in time.

222
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,142
Now your only job

223
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,446
is to pass the examination
before you.

224
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,583
Begin.

225
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,100
Sorry.

226
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,509
I know that.
I know that.

227
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,151
- I...
- Ah.

228
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,424
Please report to this next room
for your final examination.

229
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,758
Thank you.

230
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,161
Next.

231
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,130
Please report to this next room
for your final examination.

232
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,632
Thank you.

233
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,305
- Jules.
- Oh, my God. Q?

234
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,674
Oh, my God.

235
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,109
How did you get here?

236
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,244
- Well, I can't...
- really explain that.

237
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,646
- No, me neither.
- It was so weird.

238
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,814
I-I-I went into an elevator,

239
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,549
and then I got
out of the elevator.

240
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,417
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Thank God what?

241
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,119
- No, thank God that
you're confused too.

242
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,720
I just... I just started
these new meds today,

243
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,255
and I thought maybe...

244
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,658
- Stop talking, please.
- Stay focused.

245
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,461
<i>- You've just been given
an examination</i>

246
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,563
<i>of your magical aptitude.</i>

247
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,298
- "Magical"?

248
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
- We had reason to believe
you possess certain...

249
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,668
nascent abilities.

250
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,336
- Okay.

251
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,539
I mean, I used to think that...

252
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,675
- And perhaps you did
at one time.

253
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,277
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

254
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,813
I'm here to prepare
you to go home.

255
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,150
- What?
- It's all right.

256
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,686
We'll provide an alibi
for your missing time.

257
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,322
- That test was crazy.
- Any sane person...

258
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,324
I mean, all the questions
kept changing.

259
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,859
- Be that as it may...
- No!

260
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,294
Don't you want students
who make actual inquiry

261
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,497
instead of just accepting
like sheep?

262
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:58,269
I'm sorry.
Um...

263
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,771
Can I start over?

264
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,707
Please?

265
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:06,177
I can't just go to Yale
if I know this place exists.

266
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,312
- Which is why
I'm going to make sure

267
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,681
that you don't remember a thing.

268
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,601
- This won't hurt a bit.

269
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,304
- Quentin...

270
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,475
Let's see some magic.

271
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,897
- No...

272
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,601
magic, real magic.

273
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,636
Please.

274
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,376
- Okay.

275
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,219
Quentin...

276
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,688
do you like this place?

277
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,257
You have a gut feeling that...

278
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,492
it's something special?

279
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,696
You want to go back to Columbia?

280
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:35,600
That pointless,
miasmic march to death

281
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,867
you call life?

282
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,770
Family that never calls

283
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,473
and friends that don't
really get you

284
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,942
and feeling alone and wrong

285
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,979
until it crushes you?

286
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,314
- No.

287
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:54,585
- Then quit dicking around!

288
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,387
- Stop it.

289
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,557
- Do some goddamn magic!

290
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,325
- I said stop it!

291
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,731
Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God. Oh.

292
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,576
Holy shit.
I'm doing this.

293
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,454
- I wouldn't.

294
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,390
Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

295
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,725
You'll just make it worse.

296
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,860
- Jane Chatwin...

297
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,930
from the books.

298
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,865
Make what worse?

299
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,735
- And it won't stop him coming.

300
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,573
- Who?
- The Beast.

301
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,575
You're in the school.

302
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,544
He's going to find you.

303
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,479
You're the one he wants.

304
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,348
You have to learn.

305
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,716
- Learn what?
- What are you...

306
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,851
- Look down.

307
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,354
You're on the garden path.

308
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,955
Stay on,
the Beast will kill you,

309
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,091
kill everyone.

310
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,461
Step off the path or...

311
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,642
<i>- Magic is real.</i>

312
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,044
But you've gathered that,
haven't you?

313
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,546
- Have I?

314
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,481
- Three-year program,
graduate-level studies,

315
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,749
program begins immediately.

316
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,418
- How did you find me?

317
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,620
- Mm. Globes.

318
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:45,556
Sense magic...
It's not always right,

319
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,491
so we test it.

320
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,493
- How... how did
my friend do... Julia?

321
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,895
- I'm afraid
she didn't make the cut.

322
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:53,497
And my apologies
for the rocky road.

323
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,900
We certainly didn't intend
for Bob to die on you.

324
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,768
- The alumni guy?
- Mm-hmm.

325
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,537
- He works for you?
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,873
- Was he murdered?
- Snuck a box of Oreos.

327
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,109
- Magicians can't eat Oreos?

328
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,878
- Diabetics can't have Oreos.

329
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,148
- And the paramedic who...

330
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,584
Book Six"?

331
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:17,121
- Right.
- A scout... freelance, sort of.

332
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,722
Any more questions?

333
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,792
I've got another...
24 of you today.

334
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:26,597
- Um... okay...

335
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,033
So "be a magician"?

336
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,235
Is that illegal or...?

337
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,504
Are you guys trying to
take over the world or...?

338
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,140
- This school exists for
a single and timeless purpose...

339
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,008
To reveal your innate abilities

340
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,810
and hone them
to the highest degree.

341
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,979
Now, what you do with it after
that is entirely up to you.

342
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,215
If you want
to take over the world,

343
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:47,251
we don't teach that,
but give it a go.

344
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,754
Quentin, I need an answer.

345
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,875
- Friends and family
will be given the exciting news

346
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,633
of your early acceptance to
a prestigious master's program,

347
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,768
and with a little illusion work,

348
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,905
all their questions
will be answered.

349
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,975
Good.
Now, your meds.

350
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,779
Quentin, you haven't
been depressed.

351
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,649
You've been alone.

352
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,618
And you are not crazy.

353
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,520
You're angry.

354
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,088
And you are correct.

355
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,223
Everyone...

356
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,158
Everyone medicates...

357
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,594
out there.

358
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:34,298
Here, we hope you won't need to.

359
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,313
- Um...

360
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,582
are you my, uh...

361
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,655
- What up, roomie?

362
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,194
- Uh, hey, I had a...
- Okay, um, I had a...

363
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,163
- notebook right here.
- "Book Six."

364
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,665
- Did...
- And you what?

365
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,199
You think I stole it?

366
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,169
Some dumb-ass kid's book?

367
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,904
Why do you have
all that nerd-boy dragon

368
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,573
porn shit, anyway...
Are you 12?

369
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,141
Quentin!

370
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,076
This is the interruption
you've been waiting for.

371
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,313
- Hi. I'm Margo.

372
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:26,083
This is him.
Hmm.

373
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,886
He's not that cute.

374
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:33,057
- So first years
live in these dorms.

375
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,593
Then, depending on your talent,

376
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,227
you go to the house
with your emphasis.

377
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,830
- Or you flunk out,
in which case, bye-bye.

378
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,132
But you wouldn't care
'cause you won't remember.

379
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,237
- Good morning, professors.

380
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,174
Physical kids, telekinesis,

381
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:53,978
move shit, lift shit,
most can fly.

382
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,647
Also, magnificent partiers.

383
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,916
Do not come by our house
if you have anything important

384
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,751
to do the next morning.

385
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,923
Then there's illusions,
healing...

386
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,725
nature.

387
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,160
Hmm?
Knowledge.

388
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:20,004
- Psychics...
- You know what they are?

389
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:20,938
Losers.

390
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,707
Okay we heard that.

391
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,275
Eat shit, Eliot.

392
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,311
- Like I said.

393
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,751
- What? Who are they?
- Don't.

394
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,854
- You'll scare the child.
- Maybe he should be scared.

395
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:39,657
You're so dramatic.

396
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,393
- That is what's left
of the third-year class.

397
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:46,063
Were 20, now 4.
No one knows why.

398
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,732
- They're just gone?

399
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:52,302
- Mm, rumor has it, killed.
- Or flunked or got bored

400
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,205
or died 16 perfectly
natural deaths. Whatever.

401
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,408
We all signed this waiver.
I hope you read yours.

402
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,277
It says, "Spellwork is not
unlikely to murder you",

403
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,347
and, if so, oh, well."

404
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,082
- So stay
on the garden path, kid.

405
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,351
Yeah.

406
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,086
- Wait. did you say
"the garden path"?

407
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,689
- Yeah, enough maudlin blah.

408
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,290
Let's go find something magic
to smoke.

409
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,225
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,931
- At the exam,

411
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,135
each of you did magic.

412
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:29,206
What was inside you was coaxed.

413
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,477
The question is,
who can grow this magic...

414
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,380
into something more?

415
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,415
"Who can be a magician?"

416
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,320
Alice, please.

417
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,002
- Ooh, looks serious.

418
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,370
- Please...

419
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,406
an artist is at work.

420
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,361
- The answer is yes.

421
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,864
Until you pass out, and then
again when you wake up.

422
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:05,035
- Did you just read my...
- Nah, it's just a guess.

423
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,896
- Ah, one of those every year.

424
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,199
- One of what?
- Overachiever.

425
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:38,235
Shy, yet knows they're smarter
than everyone,

426
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,571
therefore everyone hates them.

427
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:43,240
- Yeah, Alice is, like...

428
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,875
I don't know how she does it.

429
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,476
- That's Alice Quinn?

430
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,446
Yeah, don't bother
trying to compare yourself.

431
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,883
I heard she comes from
a whole family of magicians.

432
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:55,986
It's good to be aware
the world is inherently unfair.

433
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,921
Act accordingly.

434
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,892
Hey, Alice, come join us.

435
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:04,261
Make some friends.
Take a load off.

436
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,366
- Poor, little magic girl.

437
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,652
- Hey, Alice.

438
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,988
Look, my friends...

439
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,122
earlier, they were...
They were just...

440
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:35,993
- Cruel? Unoriginal?

441
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:38,662
- Yeah. Sorry.

442
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,530
Just... um...

443
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,901
Look, honestly,
um, it's... it's my fault

444
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,602
that they said that.

445
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,638
They saw how jealous I am,

446
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,673
and... you're the best.

447
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,108
It's easy for you.

448
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,143
- No, I study.
- Then you get it.

449
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,511
I barely...

450
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,282
I'm terrified
I'm gonna get kicked out.

451
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,384
I need this place,

452
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:03,120
and I never had friends
or parents who under...

453
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,590
- Look, my parents
are useless, crazy people

454
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,659
who never taught me
a drop of magic, okay?

455
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,360
So, if you think that my family

456
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,330
is some sort of advantage,
you've been misinformed.

457
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,132
There, is there
anything else I can do

458
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,734
to make you feel better,
or are you good?

459
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,637
- Sorry.
- I just got your email.

460
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,339
Cell phone's aren't working
up here.

461
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,575
- My fifth email.
<i>- Sorry. I was working.</i>

462
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,210
<i>You just tell me
what you meant by...</i>

463
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,378
- I mean not herself.

464
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,615
I mean barely talks to me,
not eating.

465
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,017
<i>She looks like a goddamn ghost.</i>

466
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,119
<i>She's not Julia.</i>

467
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,421
- Why?
- What happened?

468
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,690
- If I knew,
would I need high and mighty

469
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,525
mega-genius you back here?

470
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:43,994
It's her birthday.
I'm sure you forgot that too.

471
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,662
<i>I'm throwing a party.</i>

472
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,265
- Okay. Party. Good.
- Oh, party?

473
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,368
- Oh, we're coming.
- No, it's not...

474
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,704
- Yeah, you go back out there
to the great, big, boring world,

475
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,672
you'll never find
your way back without us.

476
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,374
Trust.

477
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,242
So is it black-tie or...

478
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,384
- This is super risqué.

479
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,386
- That's better.
- Super risqué.

480
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:12,489
All right. Okay.
What is this?

481
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,592
It is a...
"Screwnacorn."

482
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,594
Q! Holy shit!

483
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,730
- Back from the wars.
- Hey.

484
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:23,600
- Hey. Hey.

485
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,469
- Hey.
- Hey.

486
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:30,340
- It's really good to see you.
- You too.

487
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,481
- Yeah.

488
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,154
- Scotch, neat.

489
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:47,224
- Saw the balloons over there.

490
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:50,093
Happy birthday.

491
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,462
Or not.

492
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,332
- Yep.
- So go jump off a cliff.

493
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,034
Thanks.

494
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,826
- I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

495
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,362
- Who?
- Brakebills.

496
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,831
Say "What's Brakebills?"
And I will stab you.

497
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:32,169
Tell them to test me again.

498
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,472
- H-how did you...
- Remember?

499
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,175
I don't know.

500
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,210
Maybe I'm a mutant.

501
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,448
Or maybe...

502
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,084
I wouldn't let myself forget.

503
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:07,471
- They'll just wipe
your memory again.

504
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,239
- I should be there.

505
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,807
- What happened
to should be at Yale?

506
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,509
- That was before I knew
there was something else.

507
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,378
Who cares about business school?
Would you?

508
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,315
- You have to be able
to<i> do</i> certain things.

509
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,251
- God, were you always
this smug?

510
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,355
Watch.

511
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,712
You have no idea
how long it took me.

512
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,714
To find a spell that was real.

513
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,918
- Yeah, it's real.
- Yeah, because I'm a magician.

514
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,753
- Not necessarily.

515
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,655
There's a...
There's just stuff out there.

516
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,423
There's a lot of nothing spells

517
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,192
that people don't even know
they're doing.

518
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,560
You go online, and there's
a video of George Bush

519
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,428
they keep taking down,
and he's drunk,

520
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,430
and he's laughing,
he's making magic air ripples.

521
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,299
- And your point is?

522
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,801
- It doesn't mean
you have potential.

523
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,172
- Ouch.

524
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,674
- I'm sorry,
but they would know.

525
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,410
- No, they missed it.
- I know that I...

526
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,846
- No, you know that
you don't want to fail.

527
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,348
- What?

528
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,284
- It's not about that.
- Are you sure, Jules?

529
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,646
Because you can do
everything else.

530
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:35,392
It's really okay
if this is not your thing.

531
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,864
You're hurting yourself,

532
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:44,334
and you're not okay.

533
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,304
- They cut off my life.

534
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,774
- Your life is here.

535
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,721
- We got to go.
- How's my hair?

536
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,456
- Good.

537
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,949
Aah!

538
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,302
- Hi.

539
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:05,715
- How does it feel
to know that...

540
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,784
I can do whatever I want to you?

541
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:20,430
Awesome.

542
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,736
I knew it.

543
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,372
- What the hell was that?
- What...

544
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,442
What are you, some kind
of crazy, psycho rapist?

545
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,377
- Hey, no.

546
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,314
No.
I would never.

547
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,516
I swear. I...

548
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,986
I just needed to see
if I was right.

549
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,689
Oh, you thought the school

550
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,957
was the only place
to track the gift?

551
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,861
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

552
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,868
- Who's "we"?

553
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,419
- Um...

554
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,621
Hello? Do you need...

555
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:19,956
Do you need help?

556
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,363
What the...?

557
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,478
- Funny thing about Fillory...

558
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,413
You don't really decide
when to go.

559
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,649
It decides...
if you deserve to.

560
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,718
You haven't listened, Quentin.

561
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,987
You stuck firm to that path.

562
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,590
It's going to kill you.
Do you understand?

563
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:54,924
- No, I don't understand.

564
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,694
- Stop talking, you child.

565
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,998
Look, I know you like
Brakebills.

566
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I know you feel
you finally belong,

567
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,935
but that place isn't the point.

568
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,470
You won't be there long.

569
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:08,705
- Shut up.
- This is a dream,

570
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:11,074
and you are a fictional,
English schoolgirl

571
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,575
stuck in my head from a book.

572
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,110
- You know I'm not.

573
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,946
- Look, Brakebills is the first
place that feels right to me

574
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,783
that is not literally
a fairy tale.

575
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,718
- Brakebills is a tool.

576
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,887
You feel right because you're
starting toward your destiny.

577
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,488
That's all.

578
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,158
Quit clinging.
Start questioning.

579
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,560
Seek real answers
that will help you fight!

580
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,595
- All right, back off.

581
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:39,469
I know that symbol.
What is it?

582
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,871
Find out, won't you?

583
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,757
- Hey, uh...
- I'm late.

584
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,091
- You were looking for something
in the cafe the other day.

585
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,760
- There was a page with a symbol.
- Go away.

586
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:07,030
- Wait.

587
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,998
What does that mean?

588
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:11,768
- How did you get this?

589
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,637
- I'll tell you if you tell me.

590
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,179
- Okay, fine.

591
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:26,583
Tonight, 10:00 p.m.,
meet me at the Admin Building.

592
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,585
And bring
an Estonian-English dictionary.

593
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,153
- What does it mean?

594
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,124
- "Contact the other side."

595
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,961
- The other side?
- What, like séance shit?

596
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,262
- Summoning, technically,
but, yes.

597
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,864
- Right.
- Summoning, of course.

598
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:42,265
Yeah, when I'm trying to
contact the dead,

599
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:44,133
I like to summon them
whenever possible.

600
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,768
- Yeah, that's the plan.

601
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,003
As soon as we get
the book that I need

602
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,505
that apparently got
pulled off the shelves

603
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,507
- two years ago.
- Pulled as in locked up?

604
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:51,875
- It's in the Dean's
private collection.

605
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,576
- Which means it needs
to be stolen, right?

606
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,845
Okay. Uh...

607
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,915
Look, I-I really...
I don't want to get kicked out.

608
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,650
And I really don't want
to be the guy

609
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,218
who dies in the first
ten minutes of the movie

610
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,686
because he's like,
"You know what?

611
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,921
"Let's take out the Ouija board.

612
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,523
What could possibly
go wrong?"

613
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,091
- Do you want
to cheat off my labs, huh?

614
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,559
Do you want a tutor?
Do you want to get straight As?

615
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,094
I can do that for you.

616
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,162
So just help me with this.

617
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,631
Okay, for some reason,
you're involved,

618
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,165
so be involved!

619
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:40,223
- Hey, Etude number 8...
- Left or right hand?

620
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,695
- Yo, pacey, what's your deal?

621
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,668
- Nothing. I...

622
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:57,674
- Look, hold that thought, okay?

623
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:59,208
- I got to...
- Got to what?

624
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,843
Hey, I'm all ears.

625
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,112
Penny, don't be a douche.
What?

626
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,647
- I can...

627
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,851
- Look, I hear voices.
- What, psychic?

628
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,620
- No, God, I hate that word.

629
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,989
- Okay, mind slut?

630
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,261
Come on, Penny,
you're not the first I've met.

631
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,730
I mean, you're not even
the first to get in my pants,

632
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,231
so...

633
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,367
- Look, so, I got to go
somewhere, all right?

634
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,269
- I'm obviously coming with you.

635
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:40,783
God.

636
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,787
Great, well, that makes me feel
a whole lot less nervous.

637
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,390
- Nut up, will you?

638
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,058
There's no such thing
as safe magic.

639
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,259
You should know that, Quentin.

640
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:52,061
Might as well take a risk.

641
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:55,264
- Great, well,
if put it like that...

642
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,800
Who are we trying to contact?
It says we... we need a name.

643
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,036
- Charlie.

644
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:03,072
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother.

645
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:05,975
He died.
It'd be nice to say hi.

646
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,347
What?

647
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:14,684
- H-h-how did he die?
- Horribly, I assume...

648
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:17,654
since no one will tell me
what happened.

649
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:23,059
All I know is that
it happened here at Brakebills

650
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,194
five years ago.

651
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,330
Did you think that I came here

652
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,800
because I just love magic
so much?

653
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,203
No.

654
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,939
I need an answer.

655
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:38,207
He deserves that.

656
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,909
So can we just concentrate?

657
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,211
We need to get this done
by exactly midnight, okay? So...

658
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,914
- Sorry.
- I mean...

659
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,116
to hear that.
I mean, I...

660
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:49,986
- Shit.
- No.

661
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,954
- What?
- No, this is good.

662
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,690
This is all making sense.

663
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,725
- Yeah. No, it is.

664
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,094
It's just we can do this.
It's just<i> we</i> can't do this.

665
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:00,363
We need...

666
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:04,934
- Oh.

667
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,770
Hi.

668
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,741
- So...
- You got to be kidding me.

669
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:13,443
We were sent here
to help these losers?

670
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,144
- Sent?

671
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,013
- Wait. Who sent you?
- No one!

672
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:20,316
Look, I got that you guys need
some extra hands or something.

673
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,886
Yes, I can.
Yes, I have.

674
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,988
Yes, everything you think
is so boring,

675
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,356
I replace it with dubstep.

676
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,325
- What's dubstep?

677
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,394
- It says we need four people.

678
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,497
"Each one a Magical Adept."

679
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:38,101
And here they are.

680
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:39,802
Please, come sit down.

681
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,871
This is perfect timing.

682
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,341
Well...

683
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:22,011
I'm hungry.

684
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,481
What? I am.

685
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,121
- Let us know
if shit gets exciting.

686
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:46,102
- I guess I'll start
cleaning up.

687
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,279
- A few helpful rules...

688
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,848
Don't demand, ask.

689
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,250
Safety first.
Be patient...

690
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,852
Nobody levels up in a day...

691
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:38,020
And don't leave
your purse lying around.

692
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:43,025
- And this what exactly?

693
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,328
- This is the real world, babe.

694
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:00,376
- Always pay close attention
to the alloys.

695
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,045
Um, iron has a...
Has a neutral quality,

696
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,314
whereas silver and gold
have the effect

697
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:09,051
of, uh, magnifying the effects
of other components of the alloy

698
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,953
and I would caution you
to test for this

699
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,089
each time before, uh...
Before using a knife

700
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:16,025
for, uh, ritual work
because, um...

701
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:20,129
A spell can alter
the metal at, uh...

702
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,298
At a quantum level.

703
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:38,514
From the, uh...

704
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:42,385
famous German poet
and, um... and wizard...

705
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,536
So, for instance, um,

706
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,505
this first device...

707
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:31,287
- Quentin Coldwater...

708
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,491
There you are.
