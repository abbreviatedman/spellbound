00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:05,391
In 2166, an immortal
tyrant named Vandal Savage

2
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:08,043
conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:10,787
I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time

4
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,564
and stop his rise to power.

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,376
Unfortunately, my plan is opposed

6
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,637
by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to:

7
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:18,125
the Time Masters.

8
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:20,360
In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,

9
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:22,337
but if we succeed,

10
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,854
they will be remembered as legends.

11
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:29,286
Previously, on "Legends
of Tomorrow"...

12
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,660
The Time Masters discourage marriage,

13
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:37,399
but I fell in love and
we had a child, Jonas.

14
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,802
- Maybe we could get a drink?
- Are you asking me out?

15
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:41,403
Yes. Is that okay?

16
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:42,871
I think my life's complicated enough

17
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:45,774
without throwing whatever
this is into the mix.

18
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:49,178
- This is Star City.
- Yes, Star City, 2046.

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,879
It's everything we've ever wanted.

20
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,781
We could live like kings here.

21
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:55,317
[grunting]

22
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:56,819
You son of a bitch.

23
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,322
You lay a hand on me
again, you'll burn too.

24
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,559
Go ahead, Jonas.

25
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,627
He's listening.

26
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,629
Hi, Daddy. We miss you.

27
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:11,400
- And love you.
- And love you.

28
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:13,702
Anything else you want to say?

29
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:17,172
Come home soon, Daddy.

30
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,541
[laughing]

31
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,009
Hi, Rip.

32
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,178
Not sure if you got
our last message.

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,029
I told Jonas that you
got caught up with work,

34
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:29,451
but I really thought
you'd be home by now.

35
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:32,387
London is...

36
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:34,623
Things have changed.

37
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,035
It's hard to tell what's going on

38
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:40,128
with so many soldiers and rumors.

39
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,866
I just want to know
you're all right.

40
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:46,134
Wherever you are,

41
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:49,705
whenever you are,

42
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:53,141
I love you, Rip.

43
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:56,845
Go ahead, Jonas. He's listening.

44
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,047
Hi, Daddy. We miss you.

45
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,571
- And love you.
- And love you.

46
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:02,951
I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain.

47
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:06,255
No, uh, not at all. Just,
uh, catching up on work.

48
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:07,389
What is all this?

49
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,724
Just trying to connect the dots,

50
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:12,227
find the optimal time to strike at Savage.

51
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,595
And?

52
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:15,230
And the trail's gone cold.

53
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:17,199
In order to preserve
the element of surprise,

54
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,433
I wager the best course of action

55
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,302
is to travel further back in time,

56
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:23,405
but nothing here indicates
where to find him.

57
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,007
Well, perhaps I can help you look.

58
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,076
I've been looking!

59
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,945
I apologize.

60
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:32,047
It's just the stakes are so high.

61
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,984
I vowed to save my family,
but I'm failing them.

62
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,489
Perhaps I'm not the Time Master they need.

63
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:43,086
You must be.

64
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:46,194
You're the only one they have.

65
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,330
- Can't Gideon help us?
- No.

66
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:50,098
When a timeship returns
to the Vanishing Point

67
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,000
after a mission, its CPU is updated

68
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,268
from the temporal database,

69
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,272
which, given my rogue status,

70
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:58,574
we are unable to do.

71
00:02:58,576 --> 00:02:59,741
So, what you're saying is

72
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:03,211
Gideon requires a software update.

73
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,380
Which explains why you've
been holed up in here

74
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,682
for the past week.

75
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:10,586
- Has it really been a week?
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:14,089
And some of our teammates
are getting just a tad antsy.

77
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,558
[screaming]

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,387
[grunts] I'm done.

79
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,018
Don't mind him.

80
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,831
He's still sore about having to leave 2046.

81
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,167
I'm sore because I was recruited

82
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,871
for my unique ability
to light things on fire.

83
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:30,607
And now, I'm locked in the one place

84
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,741
where I can't light things on fire:

85
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,176
a spaceship.

86
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:37,179
Where do you think you're going?

87
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:38,633
Why?

88
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,514
You gonna clock me in the
head if I don't listen again?

89
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,056
Everything okay with you two?

90
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,688
Yeah, peachy.

91
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,569
Captain, I've just intercepted

92
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:53,910
a deep space transmission.

93
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,603
It's a distress signal
from the Acheron.

94
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,009
- She's the...
- Flagship of the Time Fleet.

95
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,368
Yes, I know that. Thank you, Gideon.

96
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,136
Systemic malfunction.

97
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:02,738
I'm stranded, unable to jump.

99
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,208
This is Captain Eve Baxter

100
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,609
of the timeship Acheron,

101
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,979
requesting critical rescue.

102
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,816
And we care about this chick why?

103
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,718
We don't, but the Acheron's computer

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,788
will contain the current
intel on Savage's whereabouts.

105
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,556
Gideon, set a course

106
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,325
for the Acheron's position in deep space.

107
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,138
- Yes, Captain.
- Deep space?

108
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,762
I had no idea we had the ability

109
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:29,884
to explore the unknown
realms of the galaxy.

110
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:30,860
- Astonishing.
- No.

111
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:32,668
What's astonishing is that we're acting

112
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,803
as roadside assistance for
the people who's chasing us.

113
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:36,438
Doesn't it seem suspicious,

114
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,142
this distress call just
happened to reach us?

115
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:41,376
How do we know it's not a trap?

116
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:42,216
We don't, but what we do know

117
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:43,879
is that Savage's trail has run cold.

118
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,691
And unless Gideon can upload the data

119
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:49,084
- from the Acheron's computer...
- I'm in.

120
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,352
You are?

121
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,820
The sooner we end Savage, the sooner

122
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,409
- I get back to where I belong.
- Prison?

123
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:57,659
Any prison on Earth's better
than this one, Professor.

124
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,629
- Gideon.
- Yes, sir.

Of course, Captain.

It's possibly the result of a malfunction.

Just in case, Martin, I'm going to ask you

at least I'm not dying alone.

00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,416
