1
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,953
There you are.

2
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:55,755
You're late. I have
a school to run.

3
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:57,691
There are more important things.

4
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:59,826
It's always something
with you, isn't it?

5
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:03,129
It's always an emergency.

6
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,073
It's happening.

7
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:07,363
GLOBAL WARMING:
DEFINITE PROOF?

8
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:15,775
They're not even
at Brakebills yet.

9
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,511
I know. Get them there.

10
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,314
Pray that they get a little
something under their belts

11
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,516
before he finds a way to them.

12
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,653
Your ability to think

13
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,955
that we have the slightest
molecule of control

14
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,457
over anything never
ceases to amaze me.

15
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,293
It's not that.

16
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,029
I have to try.

17
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,797
We.

18
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,465
Look, this is your
responsibility.

19
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,801
You have to get them ready.
They're infants.

20
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:44,804
They know nothing, especially...

21
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:47,240
especially him.

22
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:50,043
I will do what I can,

23
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,746
and you know this.

24
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,748
I do know.

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,583
Here...

26
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,619
just in case.

27
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,758
You do still have an eye
on our boy, don't you?

28
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:07,226
Yes.

29
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,495
Great. Great.

30
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,865
Not exactly.

31
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,266
Why not?

32
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,301
Where is he?

33
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:26,684
MIDTOWN MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

34
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,173
Nice trick.

35
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,010
Well, I'm sure you're
a hit at parties.

36
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,776
So...

37
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,045
you think you're ready.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,948
- I do.
- Why?

39
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,582
I feel better.

40
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:42,055
On admitting, you reported
you couldn't concentrate,

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,556
eat, get out of bed.

42
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,225
You said the feeling

43
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,027
of not belonging anywhere
was overwhelming.

44
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:50,596
It's not sleight of hand
if you're gonna use CGI.

45
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:52,198
Well, I'm sorry. It's just...

46
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:53,733
That's insulting to
anyone who's ever done

47
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,235
any kind of close-up
magic, so...

48
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,736
And that you were the
most useless person

49
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,738
who ever lived.

50
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:02,208
And now... you feel better?

51
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,043
It's the original version,
the Danish version,

52
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,378
that it's, like... it's dark.

53
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,113
It's, like, 100 times better

54
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,083
because the Danish people, they're...
they're...

55
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,317
they have a dark soul.

56
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,086
I mean, I get it.

57
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,588
Get...?

58
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,490
You're a kid, and your
whole life's ahead of you,

59
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,458
and you have these notions...

60
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,762
about what life is...

61
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:25,932
and...

62
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,134
what it could be.

63
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,804
But eventually you have
to let all that go.

64
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,908
So that's what I'm... that's
what I'm going to do.

65
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,910
That's what I'm doing.

66
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,745
It's a part of growing up...

67
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,247
you know, selling the
comic-book collection

68
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,816
and getting serious.

69
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,407
You graduate soon.

70
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,777
- And then?
- I'm supposed to have

71
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,613
a grad-school interview
on Tuesday... Yale.

72
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:17,717
Quentin, I'd really recommend
further treatment.

73
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,586
Look, I've never threatened to
hurt myself or anybody else.

74
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:24,757
So you can't make me stay.

75
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,727
Can you?

76
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,058
THAYER QUALITY MAGIC VOL.1

77
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,166
THE ANNOTATED MAGIC OF SLYDINI

78
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,305
FILLORY AND FURTHER

79
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,703
FILLORY AND FURTHER
BOOK ONE

80
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,457
The Chatwin Twins and
their older brother

81
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,159
had been sent to
the countryside.

82
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,061
From a young age,

83
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:04,830
Martin Chatwin had
a gloomy nature.

84
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,967
And to combat his melancholy,

85
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,970
he would lose himself
in stories of wonder.

86
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,973
So he knew that he would
have trouble convincing

87
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,976
his brother and sister
that this was no fantasy.

88
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,446
Rupert, wounded in the war

89
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,149
and the first Chatwin to put
away childish things...

90
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,657
And Jane, the family skeptic.

91
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:55,048
This was Fillory.

92
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,885
A land of magic.

93
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:08,194
Rupert! Martin! Have
a look at this!

94
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:12,465
Martin thought they
needed Fillory...

95
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:16,802
but, no, Fillory needed them.

96
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,006
It is here that
our story begins,

97
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,241
but be warned...

98
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,877
this adventure is no
mere children's tale.

99
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,717
Where'd she go?

100
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,320
The... the girl in
the rainbow shorts?

101
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:35,721
Yeah, you just missed her.

102
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,723
And?

103
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,725
Not my type.

104
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,895
Dude, she was wearing
a unicorn T-shirt.

105
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,597
She's clearly into fantasy.

106
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,898
But how would you know?

107
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,368
You're in here reading
obscure fantasy,

108
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,669
and she's out there.

109
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:54,440
Honestly, like, 73 of her...

110
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,243
kind of waiting for you to
finish reading the books

111
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,178
you've already read 800 times
and come out of your room.

112
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm about to. It's just
it's a first edition,

113
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,683
and I am looking at
it one last time

114
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,652
before I sell it on eBay.

115
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,457
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this a
serious conversation?

116
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,326
Should I sit up?

117
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,801
I called you...

118
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,404
all weekend.

119
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,806
Where were you?

120
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,642
I was at my dad's.

121
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,644
I got angsty prepping
for the interview,

122
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,279
and I...

123
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,780
I fled...

124
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,251
for the magical hills of Jersey.

125
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,253
Don't judge.

126
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,787
I'd never.

127
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,725
Oh, my God.

128
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,063
My girl. My friend.

129
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:53,099
- Have you no decency?
- Not even a little.

130
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,468
Excellent. Three-way!

131
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,802
No, no, no, no!

132
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,308
Okay, we have got to
pull you together.

133
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,410
- This is it, Quentin. It.
- I'm still high.

134
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:06,245
I just... Okay, you know what?
Screw it.

135
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,147
- It's only the alumni interview.
- Right.

136
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,416
- And it's only Yale.
- Right, lesser Ivy.

137
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:12,151
And, honestly, they probably
take anyone conscious

138
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,519
for philosophy.

139
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,853
For philosophy, "conscious"
is a detriment.

140
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:17,690
- So I'm good.
- You're great.

141
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,200
- You know, you can go.
- Hey.

142
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:30,369
I am the angel protecting
your future, Coldwater.

143
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,339
Tighten your shit.

144
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,708
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,917
Hello?

146
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,692
It's Quentin Coldwater

147
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,662
for the grad-school interview?

148
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,837
I don't believe it.

149
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,550
Oh, shit!

150
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:34,679
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

151
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:45,578
Well...

152
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,181
he's dead.

153
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:51,317
By the look of him,
he was a big...

154
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,619
- I'm sorry?
- Why? Did you kill him?

155
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,821
No. Jesus.

156
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,856
I was kidding.

157
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,359
Can we go now?

158
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,362
Let's go.

159
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,500
Wait!

160
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,535
I think he left
something for you.

161
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,838
Q, come on, let's go.

162
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,445
Look at that.

163
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,681
"Fillory and Further,
Book Six: The Magicians."

164
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,783
- Look at the date... 1952.
- All right, please.

165
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,453
There are five Fillory
books, Julia... five.

166
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,222
Yeah, I-I know, Quentin.
Everyone knows.

167
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:31,290
There's always been rumors of a
sixth book that disappeared.

168
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,891
Yeah, and those are
just some stupid rumors

169
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,660
off a super-fan message board.

170
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,161
- Come on, don't be naive.
- Maybe, but maybe it's...

171
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:37,463
What, it's a very
special art project

172
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,664
that the dead guy made up?

173
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,333
'Cause I don't know...

174
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:42,067
you wrote your admissions essay
on the glory of Fillory?

175
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,703
- Come on, Q.
- Come on. What if...

176
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,238
No! You have to stop!

177
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,706
Stop what?

178
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,874
You can't run away
hard enough, can you?

179
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:53,312
What happened to giving
up on the Fillory crap?

180
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,715
You used to like Fillory.

181
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,050
Yeah, I liked it.

182
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,918
- I loved it...
- You got me into it, Julia!

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,054
I learned magic tricks
just to keep up with you.

184
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,889
It was our thing.

185
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,258
Yeah, it was our thing,

186
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,192
and it was fun, silly,
nerdy bullshit,

187
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,827
and it got us through
high school.

188
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,496
I guess I'm just a silly,
bullshit nerd, then?

189
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:11,597
Hey, I'm not saying...

190
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,931
Which never seemed to bother you

191
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,234
until right around the
second you met James.

192
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,603
I know where you
were all weekend...

193
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,005
at the hospital.

194
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,540
No.

195
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:25,444
You feel exactly like
you did the last time.

196
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,680
Life is raw.
Everybody medicates.

197
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:31,016
No, life is starting...
for real.

198
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,619
Look, I am just saying
that you are good

199
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,621
at so much stuff.

200
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,623
Pick something...

201
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,358
please.

202
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,360
Start living your life.

203
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,434
Look, I got to go meet James.

204
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,307
I love you. Call me, okay?

205
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,907
Great.

206
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,824
TO EXAM

207
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,441
Quentin Coldwater?

208
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,916
I'm Eliot.

209
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,251
You're late.

210
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,220
Follow me.

211
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,858
Okay. Hey...

212
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,694
- Di... Where am I?
- Upstate New York.

213
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,529
Upstate, but I was just...

214
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:04,930
Hey.

215
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,099
Okay, what... what
is this place?

216
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,934
Brakebills University.

217
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,303
You've been offered a
preliminary exam for entry

218
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,972
into the graduate program.

219
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,140
Am I hallucinating?

220
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:19,612
If you were, how would
asking me help?

221
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,682
Come on, or you'll miss it.

222
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,088
Late!

223
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,790
Be seated.

224
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,598
Welcome.

225
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,069
You may address me as Dean.

226
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,738
I know you have questions.

227
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,273
They will be answered in time.

228
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,109
Now your only job

229
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:55,480
is to pass the
examination before you.

230
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,651
Begin.

231
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:16,001
Sorry.

232
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:24,509
I know that. I know that.

233
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,052
I...

234
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,391
Please report to this next room
for your final examination.

235
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,826
Thank you.

236
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,062
Next.

237
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,031
Please report to this next room
for your final examination.

238
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,700
Thank you.

239
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,306
- Jules.
- Oh, my God. Q?

240
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, my God.

241
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,043
How did you get here?

242
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,145
Well, I can't...
really explain that.

243
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,647
No, me neither. It was so weird.

244
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:02,848
I-I-I went into an elevator,

245
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,516
and then I got out
of the elevator.

246
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,384
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Thank God what?

247
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,987
No, thank God that
you're confused too.

248
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,755
I just... I just started
these new meds today,

249
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,156
and I thought maybe...

250
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,659
Stop talking, please.
Stay focused.

251
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,428
You've just been
given an examination

252
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,530
of your magical aptitude.

253
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,232
"Magical"?

254
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,200
We had reason to believe
you possess certain...

255
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,669
nascent abilities.

256
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,270
Okay.

257
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,507
I mean, I used to think that...

258
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,743
And perhaps you did at one time.

259
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,211
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

260
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,881
I'm here to prepare
you to go home.

261
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,051
- What?
- It's all right.

262
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:41,720
We'll provide an alibi
for your missing time.

263
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,289
That test was crazy.
Any sane person...

264
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,291
I mean, all the questions
kept changing.

265
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,960
- Be that as it may...
- No!

266
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,228
Don't you want students
who make actual inquiry

267
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,497
instead of just
accepting like sheep?

268
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:58,203
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,773
Can I start over?

270
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,708
Please?

271
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,045
I can't just go to Yale if
I know this place exists.

272
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,213
Which is why I'm
going to make sure

273
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,649
that you don't remember a thing.

274
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,602
This won't hurt a bit.

275
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:33,238
Quentin...

276
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,442
Let's see some magic.

277
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,998
No...

278
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:03,635
magic, real magic.

279
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,670
Please.

280
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,344
Okay.

281
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,153
Quentin...

282
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:23,722
do you like this place?

283
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,191
You have a gut feeling that...

284
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,493
it's something special?

285
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,730
You want to go back to Columbia?

286
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,634
That pointless, miasmic
march to death

287
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,002
you call life?

288
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,872
Family that never calls

289
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,507
and friends that
don't really get you

290
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,077
and feeling alone and wrong

291
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,147
until it crushes you?

292
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,315
No.

293
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,653
Then quit dicking around!

294
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,388
Stop it.

295
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,591
Do some goddamn magic!

296
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,226
I said stop it!

297
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:06,765
Oh, my God.

298
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,576
Holy shit. I'm doing this.

299
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,421
I wouldn't.

300
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,325
Playing with time is
such difficult magic.

301
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,726
You'll just make it worse.

302
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,895
Jane Chatwin...

303
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,998
from the books.

304
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,900
Make what worse?

305
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,769
And it won't stop him coming.

306
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,540
- Who?
- The Beast.

307
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,542
You're in the school.

308
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,511
He's going to find you.

309
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,413
You're the one he wants.

310
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,282
You have to learn.

311
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:31,716
Learn what? What are you...

312
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,886
Look down.

313
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,288
You're on the garden path.

314
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,023
Stay on, the Beast
will kill you,

315
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,192
kill everyone.

316
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:43,461
Step off the path or...

317
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,643
Magic is real.

318
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,146
But you've gathered
that, haven't you?

319
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,513
Have I?

320
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,449
Three-year program,
graduate-level studies,

321
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,783
program begins immediately.

322
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,352
How did you find me?

323
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:42,620
Globes.

324
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,523
Sense magic... it's
not always right,

325
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,426
so we test it.

326
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,428
How... how did my friend do...
Julia?

327
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,929
I'm afraid she
didn't make the cut.

328
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,465
And my apologies for
the rocky road.

329
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,968
We certainly didn't intend
for Bob to die on you.

330
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,826
The alumni guy?

331
00:23:58,026 --> 00:23:59,504
He works for you?

332
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,841
- Was he murdered?
- Snuck a box of Oreos.

333
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,177
Magicians can't eat Oreos?

334
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,879
Diabetics can't have Oreos.

335
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:11,216
And the paramedic who...

336
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,518
gave me "Fillory: Book Six"?

337
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,189
Right. A scout...
freelance, sort of.

338
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,690
Any more questions?

339
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,793
I've got another...
24 of you today.

340
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:26,531
Okay...

341
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,067
So "be a magician"?

342
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,336
Is that illegal or...?

343
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,405
Are you guys trying to
take over the world or...?

344
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:36,208
This school exists for a
single and timeless purpose...

345
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,043
to reveal your innate abilities

346
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,811
and hone them to the
highest degree.

347
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,014
Now, what you do with it after
that is entirely up to you.

348
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,316
If you want to take
over the world,

349
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:47,386
we don't teach that,
but give it a go.

350
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,755
Quentin, I need an answer.

351
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,864
Friends and family will be
given the exciting news

352
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,534
of your early acceptance to a
prestigious master's program,

353
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,702
and with a little illusion work,

354
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,872
all their questions
will be answered.

355
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,975
Good. Now, your meds.

356
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:15,747
Quentin, you haven't
been depressed.

357
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,583
You've been alone.

358
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,519
And you are not crazy.

359
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,421
You're angry.

360
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,122
And you are correct.

361
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,291
Everyone...

362
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:28,260
everyone medicates...

363
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,529
out there.

364
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,399
Here, we hope you won't need to.

365
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,550
Are you my...

366
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,655
What up, roomie?

367
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:04,329
Hey, I had a... Okay...
I had a...

368
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:06,264
notebook right here. "Fillory
and Further: Book Six."

369
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,665
- Did...
- And you what?

370
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,367
You think I stole it?

371
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,337
Some dumb-ass kid's book?

372
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,005
Why do you have all
that nerd-boy dragon

373
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,574
porn shit, anyway... are you 12?

374
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,275
Quentin!

375
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,211
This is the interruption
you've been waiting for.

376
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,514
Hi. I'm Margo.

377
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,218
This is him.

378
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,953
He's not that cute.

379
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:33,191
So first years live
in these dorms.

380
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,594
Then, depending on your talent,

381
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,395
you go to the house
with your emphasis.

382
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,897
Or you flunk out, in
which case, bye-bye.

383
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,200
But you wouldn't care
'cause you won't remember.

384
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,405
Good morning, professors.

385
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:50,308
Physical kids, telekinesis,

386
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:54,112
move shit, lift
shit, most can fly.

387
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,714
Also, magnificent partiers.

388
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,050
Do not come by our house if
you have anything important

389
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,685
to do the next morning.

390
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:05,990
Then there's
illusions, healing...

391
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:07,725
nature.

392
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,195
Knowledge.

393
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:20,071
Psychics... you
know what they are?

394
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:21,072
Losers.

395
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,642
Okay, we heard that.

396
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,410
Eat shit, Eliot.

397
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,379
Like I said.

398
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,685
- What? Who are they?
- Don't.

399
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:36,821
- You'll scare the child.
- Maybe he should be scared.

400
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,591
You're so dramatic.

401
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,494
That is what's left of
the third-year class.

402
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:46,097
Were 20, now 4.
No one knows why.

403
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,667
They're just gone?

404
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:52,370
- Rumor has it, killed.
- Or flunked or got bored

405
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:55,273
or died 16 perfectly natural deaths.
Whatever.

406
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,509
We all signed this waiver.
I hope you read yours.

407
00:27:57,611 --> 00:28:00,278
It says, "Spellwork is not
unlikely to murder you,

408
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,381
and, if so... well."

409
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,049
So stay on the garden path, kid.

410
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,352
Yeah.

411
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:09,053
Wait. did you say
"the garden path"?

412
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,523
Yeah, enough maudlin blah.

413
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,291
Let's go find something
magic to smoke.

414
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:20,064
At the exam,

415
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:24,302
each of you did magic.

416
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:28,864
What was inside you was coaxed.

417
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:33,202
The question is, who
can grow this magic...

418
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:36,072
into something more?

419
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,107
Who can be a magician?"

420
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:42,978
Alice, please.

421
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:58,627
Looks serious.

422
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,029
Please...

423
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:02,064
an artist is at work.

424
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,019
The answer is yes.

425
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:00,422
Until you pass out, and then
again when you wake up.

426
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:04,626
- Did you just read my...
- Nah, it's just a guess.

427
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:32,487
One of those every year.

428
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,857
- One of what?
- Overachiever.

429
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,893
Shy, yet knows they're
smarter than everyone,

430
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:40,329
therefore everyone hates them.

431
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:42,898
Yeah, Alice is, like...

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,466
I don't know how she does it.

433
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:46,202
That's Alice Quinn?

434
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:49,171
Yeah, don't bother trying
to compare yourself.

435
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:52,474
I heard she comes from a
whole family of magicians.

436
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:55,577
It's good to be aware the
world is inherently unfair.

437
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,512
Act accordingly.

438
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:01,416
Hey, Alice, come join us.

439
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:03,919
Make some friends.
Take a load off.

440
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,024
Poor, little magic girl.

441
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,377
Hey, Alice.

442
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,545
Look, my friends...

443
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:31,713
earlier, they were...
they were just...

444
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:35,550
Cruel? Unoriginal?

445
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:38,420
Yeah. Sorry.

446
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,256
Just...

447
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:43,458
Look, honestly... it's...
it's my fault

448
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,361
that they said that.

449
00:31:45,462 --> 00:31:47,396
They saw how jealous I am,

450
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:49,464
and... you're the best.

451
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:50,732
It's easy for you.

452
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,801
- No, I study.
- Then you get it.

453
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:54,236
I barely...

454
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,973
I'm terrified I'm
gonna get kicked out.

455
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:00,042
I need this place,

456
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:02,711
and I never had friends
or parents who under...

457
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:06,282
Look, my parents are
useless, crazy people

458
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,384
who never taught me a
drop of magic, okay?

459
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:09,985
So, if you think that my family

460
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:12,955
is some sort of advantage,
you've been misinformed.

461
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,723
There, is there
anything else I can do

462
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:16,358
to make you feel better,
or are you good?

463
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:20,329
Sorry. I just got your email.

464
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:21,964
Cell phone's aren't
working up here.

465
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,267
- My fifth email.
- Sorry. I was working.

466
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,835
You just tell me
what you meant by...

467
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,070
I mean not herself.

468
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:31,340
I mean barely talks
to me, not eating.

469
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:33,608
She looks like a goddamn ghost.

470
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,744
She's not Julia.

471
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:37,112
Why? What happened?

472
00:32:37,214 --> 00:32:39,448
If I knew, would I
need high and mighty

473
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,250
mega-genius you back here?

474
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:43,585
It's her birthday. I'm
sure you forgot that too.

475
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:45,421
I'm throwing a party.

476
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:47,923
- Okay. Party. Good.
- Oh, party?

477
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:51,026
- Oh, we're coming.
- No, it's not...

478
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:53,462
Yeah, you go back out there to
the great, big, boring world,

479
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:55,431
you'll never find your
way back without us.

480
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,032
Trust.

481
00:32:57,134 --> 00:32:58,867
So is it black-tie or...

482
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,009
This is super risqué.

483
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,044
- That's better.
- Super risqué.

484
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:12,147
All right. Okay. What is this?

485
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:15,284
It is a... "Screwnacorn."

486
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,286
Q! Holy shit!

487
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:19,455
- Back from the wars.
- Hey.

488
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:23,292
Hey. Hey.

489
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:29,965
- It's really good to see you.
- You too.

491
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:37,139
Yeah.

492
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,712
Scotch, neat.

493
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,815
Saw the balloons over there.

494
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,684
Happy birthday.

495
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:52,154
Or not.

496
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,990
Yep. So go jump off a cliff.

497
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,625
Thanks.

498
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:22,518
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

499
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,953
- Who?
- Brakebills.

500
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:27,556
Say "What's Brakebills?"
And I will stab you.

501
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:31,693
Tell them to test me again.

502
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:35,130
- H-how did you...
- Remember?

503
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,766
I don't know.

504
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,801
Maybe I'm a mutant.

505
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,106
Or maybe...

506
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,641
I wouldn't let myself forget.

507
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:07,062
They'll just wipe
your memory again.

508
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,763
I should be there.

509
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,466
What happened to
should be at Yale?

510
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,134
That was before I knew
there was something else.

511
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,970
Who cares about business school?
Would you?

512
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,906
You have to be able
to do certain things.

513
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,809
God, were you always this smug?

514
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,946
Watch.

515
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:48,370
You have no idea how
long it took me.

516
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:50,405
To find a spell that was real.

517
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:54,676
- Yeah, it's real.
- Yeah, because I'm a magician.

518
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,478
Not necessarily.

519
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,347
There's a... there's
just stuff out there.

520
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,015
There's a lot of nothing spells

521
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,716
that people don't even
know they're doing.

522
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:03,185
You go online, and there's
a video of George Bush

523
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,020
they keep taking down,
and he's drunk,

524
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,988
and he's laughing, he's
making magic air ripples.

525
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,857
And your point is?

526
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,460
It doesn't mean you
have potential.

527
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,299
I'm sorry, but they would know.

528
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:19,968
No, they missed it.
I know that I...

529
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,504
No, you know that you
don't want to fail.

530
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:24,906
What?

531
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,808
- It's not about that.
- Are you sure, Jules?

532
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,843
Because you can do
everything else.

533
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:34,949
It's really okay if
this is not your thing.

534
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,589
You're hurting yourself,

535
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:43,925
and you're not okay.

536
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:46,895
They cut off my life.

537
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:50,465
Your life is here.

538
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:04,346
- We got to go.
- How's my hair?

539
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,980
Good.

540
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:51,826
Hi.

541
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:04,606
How does it feel to know that...

542
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,675
I can do whatever I want to you?

543
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,220
Awesome.

544
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,594
I knew it.

545
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:28,163
What the hell was that? What...

546
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,232
what are you, some kind
of crazy, psycho rapist?

547
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,168
Hey, no.

548
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,070
No. I would never.

549
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:38,340
I swear. I...

550
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,943
I just needed to see
if I was right.

551
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,579
Oh, you thought the school

552
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:46,915
was the only place
to track the gift?

553
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:50,819
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

554
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:57,826
Who's "we"?

555
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:17,446
Hello? Do you need...

556
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,847
Do you need help?

557
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,153
What the...?

558
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,301
Funny thing about Fillory...

559
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:42,203
you don't really
decide when to go.

560
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:45,507
It decides... if you deserve to.

561
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,576
You haven't listened, Quentin.

562
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:49,911
You stuck firm to that path.

563
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,414
It's going to kill you.
Do you understand?

564
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,849
No, I don't understand.

565
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,551
Stop talking, you child.

566
00:39:57,921 --> 00:40:00,922
Look, I know you
like Brakebills.

567
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,924
I know you feel you
finally belong,

568
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,893
but that place isn't the point.

569
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,327
You won't be there long.

570
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,596
Shut up. This is a dream,

571
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:10,064
and you are a fictional,
English schoolgirl

572
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,433
stuck in my head from a book.

573
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,101
You know I'm not.

574
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,904
Look, Brakebills is the first
place that feels right to me

575
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:18,707
that is not literally
a fairy tale.

576
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,609
Brakebills is a tool.

577
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,844
You feel right because you're
starting toward your destiny.

578
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:24,345
That's all.

579
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,181
Quit clinging.
Start questioning.

580
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:29,418
Seek real answers that
will help you fight!

581
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,453
All right, back off.

582
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:38,293
I know that symbol. What is it?

583
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,796
Find out, won't you?

584
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,049
Hey... You were looking for something
in the cafe the other day.

585
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,651
- There was a page with a symbol.
- Go away.

586
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,987
Wait.

587
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,923
What does that mean?

588
00:41:09,526 --> 00:41:10,659
How did you get this?

589
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,495
I'll tell you if you tell me.

590
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:22,136
Okay, fine.

591
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:25,406
Tonight, 10:00 p.m., meet
me at the Admin Building.

592
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,408
And bring an
Estonian-English dictionary.

593
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,143
What does it mean?

594
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,115
"Contact the other side."

595
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:36,918
The other side? What,
like séance shit?

596
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,286
Summoning,
technically, but, yes.

597
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,788
Right. Summoning, of course.

598
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,289
Yeah, when I'm trying
to contact the dead,

599
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:43,124
I like to summon them
whenever possible.

600
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:44,659
Yeah, that's the plan.

601
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:45,961
As soon as we get the
book that I need

602
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:47,362
that apparently got
pulled off the shelves

603
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,364
- two years ago.
- Pulled as in locked up?

604
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:50,799
It's in the Dean's
private collection.

605
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,433
Which means it needs
to be stolen, right?

606
00:41:52,536 --> 00:41:54,769
Okay...

607
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:57,839
Look, I-I really... I don't
want to get kicked out.

608
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,474
And I really don't
want to be the guy

609
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:01,175
who dies in the first ten
minutes of the movie

610
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:02,511
because he's like,
"You know what?

611
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:03,812
"Let's take out the Ouija board.

612
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:05,313
What could possibly go wrong?"

613
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:07,015
Do you want to
cheat off my labs?

614
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:08,349
Do you want a tutor? Do you
want to get straight As?

615
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,051
I can do that for you.

616
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,120
So just help me with this.

617
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,488
Okay, for some reason,
you're involved,

618
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,156
so be involved!

619
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:39,213
Hey, Etude number 8...
left or right hand?

620
00:42:43,153 --> 00:42:44,553
Yo, pacey, what's your deal?

621
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:50,491
Nothing. I...

622
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,565
Look, hold that thought, okay?

623
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,232
- I got to...
- Got to what?

624
00:42:58,334 --> 00:42:59,701
Hey, I'm all ears.

625
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:02,037
Penny, don't be a douche. What?

626
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:03,438
I can...

627
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,709
- Look, I hear voices.
- What, psychic?

628
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:09,410
No, God, I hate that word.

629
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:11,880
Okay, mind slut?

630
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:17,218
Come on, Penny, you're
not the first I've met.

631
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,554
I mean, you're not even the
first to get in my pants,

632
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:21,189
so...

633
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,357
Look, so, I got to go
somewhere, all right?

634
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,226
I'm obviously coming with you.

635
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:39,641
God.

636
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:43,645
Great, well, that makes me
feel a whole lot less nervous.

637
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:46,414
Nut up, will you?

638
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:47,983
There's no such thing
as safe magic.

639
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,250
You should know that, Quentin.

640
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:50,986
Might as well take a risk.

641
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:54,255
Great, well, if put
it like that...

642
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:56,658
Who are we trying to contact?
It says we... we need a name.

643
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,893
Charlie.

644
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:01,963
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother.

645
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:04,833
He died. It'd be nice to say hi.

646
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:10,304
What?

647
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:13,441
- H-h-how did he die?
- Horribly, I assume...

648
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:16,444
since no one will tell
me what happened.

649
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,950
All I know is that it
happened here at Brakebills

650
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:24,152
five years ago.

651
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:26,287
Did you think that I came here

652
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:29,624
because I just love
magic so much?

653
00:44:30,994 --> 00:44:33,128
No.

654
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,830
I need an answer.

655
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:37,165
He deserves that.

656
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:38,767
So can we just concentrate?

657
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:41,169
We need to get this done by
exactly midnight, okay? So...

658
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:43,772
Sorry. I mean...

659
00:44:43,874 --> 00:44:46,041
to hear that. I mean, I...

660
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:48,877
Shit. No.

661
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,845
What? No, this is good.

662
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:52,480
This is all making sense.

663
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:54,549
Yeah. No, it is.

664
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,052
It's just we can do this.
It's just we can't do this.

665
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:59,320
We need...

666
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:06,561
Hi.

667
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:10,531
- So...
- You got to be kidding me.

668
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:12,400
We were sent here to
help these losers?

669
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,035
Sent?

670
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:15,870
- Wait. Who sent you?
- No one!

671
00:45:15,972 --> 00:45:19,240
Look, I got that you guys need
some extra hands or something.

672
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,711
Yes, I can. Yes, I have.

673
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:24,846
Yes, everything you
think is so boring,

674
00:45:24,948 --> 00:45:26,314
I replace it with dubstep.

675
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,249
What's dubstep?

676
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,351
It says we need four people.

677
00:45:30,453 --> 00:45:33,487
"Each one a Magical Adept."

678
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,991
And here they are.

679
00:45:37,094 --> 00:45:38,659
Please, come sit down.

680
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:40,729
This is perfect timing.

681
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:17,232
Well...

682
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,835
I'm hungry.

683
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,472
What? I am.

684
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:31,012
Let us know if shit
gets exciting.

685
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,993
I guess I'll start cleaning up.

686
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:29,070
A few helpful rules...

687
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:30,504
Don't demand, ask.

688
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:33,041
Safety first. Be patient...

689
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,542
nobody levels up in a day...

690
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,744
and don't leave your
purse lying around.

691
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:41,749
And this what exactly?

692
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:44,152
This is the real world, babe.

693
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,133
Always pay close
attention to the alloys.

694
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:01,736
Iron has a... has a
neutral quality,

695
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,072
whereas silver and
gold have the effect

696
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:07,742
of... magnifying the effects of
other components of the alloy

697
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,610
and I would caution
you to test for this

698
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:11,779
each time before...
before using a knife

699
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:14,715
for... ritual work because...

700
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:18,819
a spell can alter
the metal at...

701
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:21,055
at a quantum level.

702
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:37,338
From the...

703
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,175
famous German poet and...
and wizard...

704
00:48:57,627 --> 00:48:59,294
So, for instance...

705
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,262
this first device...

706
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:30,044
Quentin Coldwater...

707
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:34,315
There you are.
