My brother.

717
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,646

nice to say hi.

How did he die?

720
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,320
Horribly, I assume.

721
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,768
Since no one will
tell me what happened.

722
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,245
All I know is that
it happened here

723
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,685
at Brakebills
five years ago.

I came here because

so much?

No.

I need an answer.

728
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,680
He deserves that.

729
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,841
So can we just
concentrate?

730
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,888
We need to get this done
by exactly midnight, okay?

731
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,520
Sorry. I mean...

732
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,410

No, this is good.

we can't do this.
