00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:01,597
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:03,989
Hey, would you break up
with me if I told you

3
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:06,076
<i>that I have never been happier
in my entire life?</i>

4
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:07,912
<i>You wished my boyfriend away.</i>

5
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:09,364
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

6
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,366
Other people aren't supposed
to get between us.

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,540
<i>This is the most pathetic
loser dream ever.</i>

8
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,009
This is all in your head.
I'm in your head.

9
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:24,045
Marina didn't betray my mom;
she cleaned up her mess.

10
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:26,054
<i>Wait, you know
who has a ton of new stuff?</i>

11
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:27,682
<i>Marina.</i>

12
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,050
Run.

13
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,052
Help!
Help!

14
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:32,720
There are good people
out there, Julia,

15
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:34,556
people trying to learn
about the world

16
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,224
and make it a better place.

17
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,560
I need a key to unlock
the door to Fillory.

18
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,278
<i>Let's see this button.</i>

19
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:09,757
The hell am I?

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,119
Hi.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,458
I come in peace.

22
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:49,464
Do you talk?

23
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,266
Haven't seen you
around here before.

24
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:53,768
First-timer.

25
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,687
From?

26
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:57,021
Not here.

27
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,973
You?

28
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,783
Eh, nice try, psychic.

29
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,401
Gonna need to get to know
a girl a little better

30
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:05,698
before she lets you go
running around up there.

31
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:09,406
- Yeah, I wasn't.
- You were, but it's okay.

32
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,410
Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

33
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,245
- I'm Eve.
- Penny.

34
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,297
- Do you live here?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,216
Born and raised.

36
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:20,931
I'm actually kind of
the welcome committee.

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,087
I keep track of the fountains.
I felt you come through.

38
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,888
Please tell me that I can help
you get where you need to go.

39
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:28,759
Okay, where are we exactly?

40
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:31,562
- The Neitherlands.
- And that is...

41
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:34,098
The Neitherlands
are sort of the place

42
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,150
between all other places.

43
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:39,570
It's how you get from A to B.

44
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,072
Which fountain
did you come out of?

45
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,740
- Over there. Earth.
- Ooh.

46
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:45,909
You know, we don't get
too many of you guys,

47
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,946
but when you come, you always
have the most interesting magic.

48
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:50,447
So?

49
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,783
Tell me, what brought you here?

50
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:53,951
Hmm?

51
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,169
I've pretty much
seen it all--

52
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:56,787
enchanted capes, rings.

53
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,673
This one guy, he rode a sled
pulled by flying--

54
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,958
what do you call them?

55
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,959
Not zebra.

56
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:04,428
Reindeer.

57
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:06,013
- Santa Claus?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:07,631
You know him?
He's a really nice guy, right?

59
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:08,799
Yeah.
No.

60
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,801
What? I--

61
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,269
No, I didn't have
anything like that.

62
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:13,470
Just a button.

63
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:14,472
That's new.

64
00:03:14,523 --> 00:03:16,306
Can I see it?

65
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,218
God damn it.

66
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,675
Oh, my God.

67
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:21,588
What?

68
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,373
I need your help
to fix the hyperdrive

69
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,209
and get a message to my friends.

70
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:28,045
I can help you
if you help me find my dragons.

71
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,266
Let's do it.

72
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,550
Let's find your dragons,

73
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:36,770
and I--oh, hey, look.

74
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:38,222
I respect the shit
out of you both,

75
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:39,773
and you are leaders,

76
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,391
and you're people,
and I'm a feminist--

77
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,060
If you would just
shut up for two seconds,

78
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,896
this sex dream would pass
the Bechdel test, Quentin.

79
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:47,030
God.

80
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:50,734
Nice dream, loser.

81
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:53,036
Why do you ruin everything
in my life?

82
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:02,940
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

83
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:09,720
- Alice.
- Huh?

84
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:12,089
- I just talked to Penny.
- Wait, what?

85
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:14,057
Where is he?
What happened?

86
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,892
It's not what it looks like.

87
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,145
I mean, it looks like
a Grade A nerd-boy wet dream,

88
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,764
and I want--God, I want
to make fun of you,

89
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,766
but the more I consider it,

90
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:24,568
you might be
some kind of savant.

91
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,270
Look.
Where have you been?

92
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:29,740
So wait.
I was making out with who?

93
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,108
Uh, nobody.

94
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,909
You said I was there
making out with someone.

95
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,244
No. Yes.

96
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,779
Not--I mean, not
that it's important.

97
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,114
It was sort of Julia.

98
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:38,832
Julia.

99
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,417
Your lifelong crush.

100
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:42,452
Dreams are weird.
People are...

101
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:44,504
naked, and animals
are smoking cigarettes.

102
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,290
I--look.
Here's what's important.

103
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,758
You've been gone for six weeks.

104
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,594
No, I've been gone six hours.

105
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,798
Shit.

106
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,683
- Where are you, anyway?
- The Neitherlands.

107
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:59,186
I thought it might be
some Fillory shit.

108
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:00,937
Uh, I mean,
it sounds familiar, but--

109
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:03,190
It's, like, fountains
and plazas up the ass,

110
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,442
and then the fountains,
they all go to different worlds.

111
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,144
I'll check the books
when I wake up.

112
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,862
Man, the one time I need you
to know this Comic-Con shit.

113
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,614
Why don't you just jump back
into the Earth fountain?

114
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,149
'Cause I'm lost.

115
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:13,817
There's three moons here,
Quentin.

116
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,485
My internal compass is
having a grand mal seizure.

117
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:16,987
Okay, so why don't you
just travel back here?

118
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,322
If you can "Inception" me
from there--

119
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:19,706
I can't aim.

120
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:22,626
If I try to travel back,
I could end up dead.

121
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:28,632
Look.
I need your help.

122
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,301
What do we know
about these Neitherlands?

123
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,170
I don't remember them
from the "Fillory" books.

124
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:35,005
There's not much.

125
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,673
In "The Wandering Dune,"
Jane and Rupert

126
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,892
meet this talking dromedary
named Cameltoes.

127
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:41,395
No. Seriously?

128
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,846
- Amazing.
- It was 1943.

129
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,515
It wasn't a dirty thing
to say back then.

130
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,734
Anyway, he talks about
a world between worlds,

131
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,020
and then he vanishes,
and that's it.

132
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:52,689
I might know somebody
who can help us, who's traveled.

133
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,408
Well, you've never
mentioned that before.

134
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:56,193
Well, we've never been
this desperate before.

135
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:57,694
Okay, so we're all in agreement.

136
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,697
We should ask the lizard man.

137
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,532
What?

138
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,035
The lizard man over there.

139
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,371
Eliot.
Honey, what are you on?

140
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:09,256
Some pinks, a green,

141
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,043
and a tab of something called
"chocolate sunshine."

142
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,212
I really like the name.
Do you like the name?

143
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:19,182
Uh.

144
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:21,017
Maybe I shouldn't have
had that green.

145
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,103
Maybe you should get
checked out at the infirmary.

146
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,773
That's nonsense.

147
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:29,609
Me strong like bull.

148
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:31,695
Let's go on a quest.

149
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,564
You two go talk
to Alice's whatever.

150
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,567
Eliot, honey, maybe you and I
should go upstairs and rest.

151
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:38,902
Wait, wait, wait.

152
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,873
Are my eyes open
or closed right now?

153
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
How about now?

154
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:54,751
Shit.

155
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,173
Shit.

156
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,424
Uh, coming!

157
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,561
Don't worry.
It's only me.

158
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:12,979
I was just checking
the Free Trader app

159
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:15,015
to see if you'd imploded.

160
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,349
I kept that offline.

161
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:20,187
Uh, so...
what do I call you?

162
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:23,657
Like, Richard
or Failstaff or--

163
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,192
Richard,
though some of the others

164
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,693
might prefer
their log-in names.

165
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:29,529
Hey, when was the last time
you unplugged?

166
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,665
- It's been a while.
- Oh.

167
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,333
But, I mean,
when was the last time

168
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:37,204
I had actual friends to discuss
"Godel, Escher, Bach" with?

169
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,539
But listen. The portals
are gonna take me a couple hours

170
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,676
to calculate if you want to,
you know, straighten up.

171
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,377
Thank God.

172
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,879
Listen, do you mind
if we commandeer the guest room

173
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,380
for the project?

174
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:49,349
Um, what project?

175
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,184
Aha.

176
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,721
Ah, you and Asmodeus will learn
more once you've leveled up.

177
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,189
The next 12 spells.

178
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,724
No mistakes.

179
00:09:57,776 --> 00:09:59,226
Wow.

180
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,778
"The," um...

181
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,531
"The Spellbinder"?

182
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:07,033
I mean, it was right there.

183
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,735
Mm.

184
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,871
Yeah, because it's
a binder filled with spells.

185
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:27,754
Hi.

186
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,092
You must be Vicious Circe.

187
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,094
I'm Silver.

188
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:37,815
- Hi.
- Bender.

189
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,566
Thanks for having me.

190
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,268
I'm extremely happy finally
to meet you face-to-face.

191
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,153
I've taken the liberty of
writing a cooperative variation

192
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:44,654
on the spell
I sent you last week.

193
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,275
Menolly.
Finally, in person.

194
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:50,328
How you feeling?

195
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,279
So good.

196
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:54,948
I am danked
as shit right now, girl.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,083
The perks of chemo
just keep rolling in.

198
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,120
Hi.

199
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:02,505
Asmodeus is the last one.

200
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,674
She's actually just
coming from uptown,

201
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,460
but rush hour, you know.

202
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,466
- Hi.
- Asmodeus.

203
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,935
Welcome.

204
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:19,973
You two know each other.

205
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:27,314
Obviously I didn't realize
that you two had history,

206
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,282
and I don't want to dismiss it,

207
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,817
but we are running
out of time here,

208
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,120
and we need both of you.

209
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:36,039
Okay?

210
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,624
Of course.

211
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:42,662
I've never been
to Chicago before.

212
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,214
This isn't Chicago;
it's the 'burbs.

213
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,632
We should make this fast.

214
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,167
Maybe you can wait outside
while I run in.

215
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,501
Come on, Vix,
when are you gonna tell me

216
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:49,502
who we're here to see?

217
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,804
What's the big secret?

218
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,555
Just let me do the talking.

219
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:08,238
Jesus, it's like
the TARDIS in here.

220
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:09,990
What kind of magic
are these people using?

221
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,025
Thibadeau's Planar Compression.

222
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,410
It's really not a big deal.

223
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,079
Alice, who's house
is this, exactly?

224
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,697
Alice.

225
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,535
Hi, Dad.

226
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,062
Come, come, come, come.

227
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,897
So glad you guys could make it
for the Veneralia,

228
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,733
the Roman festival of Venus.

229
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,936
Did Alice tell you
I study historical magic?

230
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:41,105
We celebrate all the Roman
holidays around here.

231
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,075
Jesus Christ,
how come you didn't tell me

232
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,577
we were coming
to see your parents?

233
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:46,911
Because I knew you'd make
a big deal out of it

234
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:48,279
and act like this.

235
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,248
Well--I--
so they're travelers?

236
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:51,449
Amongst other things?

237
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,784
No, my mom just
knows a traveler.

238
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,118
Look, it's complicated.
Just--shh.

239
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,787
Let me handle it.

240
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,789
Really hope you can
come back for the Saturnalia.

241
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,842
Much less tame
than this whole thing.

242
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,961
- Right. This is a little tame.
- Hmm.

243
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,596
Dad, I need to talk
to Mom, like, now.

244
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:05,631
It's important.

245
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,515
Well, after a frolic,

246
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,300
she'll usually head
for the tepidarium.

247
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,935
Can you please
just call it the bath?

248
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,304
Nonsense.
This is my domus.

249
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,306
I shall call it what I please.

250
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,525
Ugh.

251
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,777
Okay, look.

252
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,647
Distract my dad.
I'll be 30 minutes, tops.

253
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,033
Please?

254
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,623
So, dating my daughter, eh?

255
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,827
Let's have a little
fatherly chat.

256
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,165
I can't believe
I gave up tickets

257
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,834
to "Hamilton" for this.

258
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:45,720
Um, sorry you have
to do your job.

259
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,805
Ugh, story of my life.

260
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,724
Anyway, there's nothing
wrong with him.

261
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,643
Really?
Nothing at all?

262
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,811
Well, he has
a massive drug problem,

263
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:56,064
but at least
he's medicating, hmm?

264
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,515
Ah.

265
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,400
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

266
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:00,685
You, on the other hand,

267
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:03,404
appear to require
medical intervention.

268
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,522
What?

269
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,915
That was me?

270
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:14,699
Yep.

271
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:17,535
Something's draining
her chi, her life force--

272
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:18,920
or someone.

273
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,756
So, okay, I know that
this is embarrassing,

274
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,374
but trust me, dying is worse.

275
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,510
Have you engaged
in any unprotected rituals

276
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,762
of any kind?

277
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,013
Be honest.

278
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:32,183
God.

279
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,385
That son of a bitch.

280
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:39,223
They're chanting something.

281
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:40,892
Uh, look.
We should get started.

282
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,061
We have a lot of spells
to get through.

283
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:49,734
You know, first,
I just want to be clear.

284
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,203
Richard might be
about forgiveness,

285
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,905
but I'm sure as shit not.

286
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,239
Look, I'm sorry you and your mom

287
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,041
had a shitty relationship,

288
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:59,961
but not a day goes by
where I don't feel terrible

289
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,579
about what happened to her.

290
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,414
I did not cause her death, okay?

291
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,633
I only wish that
I could've stopped it.

292
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:07,752
I'm just trying to make up
for my past,

293
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:09,087
just like you.

294
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:13,591
Did she suffer?

295
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,432
She said she loved you.

296
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,685
Yeah, I know she did.

297
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:31,109
So are we gonna do this,
or what?

298
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,621
Whoa.

299
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,256
William.

300
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,791
You're late.

301
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:49,093
I'm what?
Who are you?

302
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:51,462
You always ask
the same questions.

303
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,181
I don't know
what you're talking about.

304
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:54,599
You never do.

305
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm a member of The Order,

306
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:58,603
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands,

307
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,139
the greatest repository
of knowledge, full stop.

308
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,816
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are

309
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:06,611
that are trying to kill me?

310
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,480
The locals used to work for us
in a custodial function,

311
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,784
but labor relations
have become somewhat...

312
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,485
strained of late.

313
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,370
We had to ban them
from the libraries.

314
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:18,456
They've been thoroughly cursed,
so they can't use the fountains,

315
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:21,125
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment,

316
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:24,712
some with a particularly
nasty entity.

317
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,330
The Beast?

318
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,049
Well, he has many names.

319
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:30,134
Look, this is all great,

320
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,337
but I'm just trying to get back
to the Earth fountain.

321
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,555
Can you show me where it is?

322
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,174
I suppose
I could order you a map,

323
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:37,866
but it'd have to come
from another branch.

324
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,343
Great, let's do that.

325
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:40,845
Interlibrary loans
typically take

326
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,513
two to four weeks to process.

327
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,682
Are you kidding?
That's two years on my world.

328
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,235
Then I'm afraid we are limited

329
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,854
to the resources of this branch.

330
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,191
Follow me.

331
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,531
Alice?

332
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:06,087
Hi, Mom.

333
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:08,840
Alice.

334
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,042
Fine.

335
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,543
Stephanie.

336
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,712
You know how
I feel about "Mom."

337
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:17,598
I just--I have an important
question to ask you.

338
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:19,600
Sure.

339
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,936
Push past everything
you left on the table

340
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:24,388
the last time we spoke.

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,390
I'm sure you've forgotten
all about it.

342
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,892
Oh, my God.

343
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,704
You're really not gonna
let that go, are you?

344
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,780
Because we haven't
finished discussing it.

345
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,448
It was six months ago.

346
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,121
Look, I just--

347
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:43,074
Mom--Stephanie,

348
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,716
I don't see the point
in talking about it.

349
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:46,544
We don't agree on it,
and we're never going to.

350
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,913
Well, because you act like
there's something wrong with me.

351
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,715
No, I just think
it's weird that you--

352
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,885
you're not at all curious
about what happened to Charlie.

353
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,419
It's not gonna bring him back,

354
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,922
so I don't want to know...

355
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,476
Which is a perfectly
reasonable position

356
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,729
in spite of how you judge me.

357
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:07,398
Fine.
Okay, fine.

358
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,767
Okay, I don't need
that patronizing tone.

359
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,152
Then what do you want from me?

360
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,989
How about...
hmm...

361
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:18,326
you admit that your mother
is a human being,

362
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,278
because you act
like you're the only one

363
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,497
who has a right to feel.

364
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,616
No, I don't.

365
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,501
I just--

366
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,454
Okay.

367
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,506
I think we're done talking.

368
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:36,127
This conversation
has worn me out entirely.

369
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,796
Excuse me.

370
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,986
Evert second I spend in
this place, it's just...

371
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,319
I just feel like I'm being
pulled back into this version

372
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,820
of me when I was, like,
12 and furious

373
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,273
and invisible and mute.

374
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,311
Ugh, she just fucking
does that to me.

375
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:12,014
Well, I'm sure being cooped up
in your old room helps.

376
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,850
It's like going back
in time to 2004.

377
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,685
The "Garden State" soundtrack.

378
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,437
Hey, that was cool
when it came out.

379
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,525
"The Joy of Sex"?

380
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,194
Is that, uh, Stephanie?

381
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,412
My dad.

382
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:29,031
He meant well.

383
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,999
But my mom made him give me
the version from the '70s

384
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,367
because she thinks
that kids should know

385
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,702
what pubic hair looks like.

386
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:35,504
Jesus Christ.

387
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,374
I can't imagine what you must
be thinking of me right now.

388
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,842
It's cool.

389
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:45,097
I'm, like, really
into damaged chicks.

390
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:48,183
Like Julia?

391
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,018
Alice, I don't know what
you think Julia and I were,

392
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:53,889
but the truth is
that we weren't anything.

393
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,058
We were two kids
who tested well,

394
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,893
got placed together,
and I got a crush

395
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,278
because that's
how hormones work,

396
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:00,946
and she didn't,
and I got over it,

397
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:03,365
and the end.

398
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,955
I'm kind of new
to this whole thing,

399
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,740
if you hadn't guessed.

400
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:15,460
All my past relationships were,
like, you know, at a party.

401
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:19,464
"Can we just do this
standing up?" kind of thing.

402
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
Well, the fact
that you could want

403
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,918
to have sex with anyone

404
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,921
after living in this house
is pretty impressive.

405
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,175
Thanks.

406
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,565
So what's the deal
with this traveler?

407
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,767
Why can't we just ask?

408
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,102
I mean...

409
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:41,903
Okay, so...

410
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:47,075
My mom knows this traveler
from another world, Joe.

411
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,610
- Joe?
- Yeah.

412
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,495
Apparently his actual name
is impossible to pronounce.

413
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,781
Anyway, it's kind of
a touchy subject,

414
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,167
and I think that it's best
that when I talk to my mom,

415
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:56,451
my dad's not around.

416
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,420
Why?
Is she sleeping with Joe?

417
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,507
And your dad doesn't know?

418
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:07,129
Alice, they were having
a sex party when we showed up.

419
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,930
Look, I know
it sounds ridiculous,

420
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:12,434
but my parents
are weird and possessive,

421
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,770
and they just have
to do everything together.

422
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:18,607
Look, when I was ten,

423
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,359
my dad caught my mom
having an affair,

424
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:23,278
and he threatened
to commit suicide.

425
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,982
Oh, my God.

426
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:29,151
He said he had to go extreme
just to get her attention,

427
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,486
which--he was psychotic,

428
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:33,822
but he wasn't wrong.

429
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:39,378
I think he would have done it
if she hadn't come around.

430
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:42,831
Well...

431
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,503
Now I kind of feel like
a dick for making fun

432
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,389
of your "Garden State"
soundtrack.

433
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:54,676
Total dick.

434
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,511
Now you have to help me.

435
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,860
I think that was
one of your memories.

436
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,029
Yeah.

437
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,331
- Antarctica.
- Jesus.

438
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,417
What brought you there?

439
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:21,002
Brakebills.

440
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,704
So what happened?

441
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,339
I mean, why'd you leave?

442
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,708
They found out my deal,

443
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,178
and it was either stay
and get brain-wiped

444
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,347
or jet.

445
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,015
I was heading to New York.

446
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:37,219
I was coming to kill Marina.

447
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,888
Well, then what happened?

448
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,524
I met Richard,

449
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,445
and he convinced me
Marina could wait

450
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,365
and invited me to join
the Free Trader Beowulf,

451
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:53,735
which sounded--
I don't know--

452
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:57,289
maybe better than death
or jail, so--

453
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:03,378
Uh, everything okay in there?

454
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,046
Yeah, great.
All good.

455
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,048
I know a hundred ways
to break in.

456
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,417
We have four spells left.

457
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,801
Let's just finish, okay?

458
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:12,421
Then they have to let us in
on their project.

459
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,592
Just a little further.

460
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:23,315
Wait a minute.
I--I know these people.

461
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,983
Well, every book is here--

462
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,402
all the books ever written,
all the books never written,

463
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:30,272
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

464
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,940
This is my book.

465
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,742
Yo.

466
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:36,278
Why are there all these flowers
and shit on the cover?

467
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:40,248
People who read
their books often discover

468
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:42,784
they don't like
the main character

469
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:45,420
and are rarely happy
with how it ends.

470
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:55,597
Ah.
Here it is.

471
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:57,966
Wait, Martin?
That's--

472
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:59,634
That's one of the Fillory kids.

473
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,603
Okay, is there anything
in there about The Beast?

474
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,605
I'm sorry.
I can't lend you this.

475
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,607
Not without a library card.

476
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:08,026
Course you can't.

477
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,281
You know, shit like this is
why people hate librarians.

478
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,952
What are you doing?

479
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,654
Here's what would happen
if we did what you're thinking:

480
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,123
you'd try to steal
this book by force,

481
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,959
we'd fight, you'd lose,

482
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,494
but you'd rip out several pages

483
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:29,998
before I banished you
from the library.

484
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,334
This way, no books get hurt.

485
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,901
Ff...

486
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:51,653
I hate this place.

487
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,668
***

488
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,541
Oh, here.
You have to try this.

489
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:00,576
Mmm.

490
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:04,546
- Filleted goat penis.
- Mmm.

491
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,748
Promotes virility.
Hmm?

492
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,750
That's very thoughtful
of you, Dad.

493
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:09,751
Oh.

494
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:17,425
So, Daniel, you were saying
that your discipline

495
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:18,810
is in historical magic.

496
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:20,095
Indeed.
Ah.

497
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:22,430
The Romans still fascinate me.

498
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:24,432
In fact, I'm about
to publish my third volume

499
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:27,152
on illusion work
of the Collis Aventinus.

500
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:28,770
Oh, could I see it?

501
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,438
Well, it's still in galleys,

502
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,773
but I suppose
I could show you--

503
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,274
Oh, great.
Uh, that sounds great.

504
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:34,826
Could we--which--
let's go now.

505
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,501
But you haven't even
touched your penis.

506
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,113
You know what?
I had a ton of it yesterday.

507
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:39,280
You said that it was this way.

508
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:41,282
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, well...

509
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,621
Stephanie...

510
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:48,623
I was wrong, and you were right,

511
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,127
and I promise to be a better
daughter in the future.

512
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:54,763
Right about what?

513
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,916
I couldn't possibly know
how you feel

514
00:25:57,918 --> 00:26:00,251
other than that you feel deeply,

515
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:02,671
and you are your own person,

516
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,389
and you're the only one

517
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:06,257
who knows how to deal
with your stuff,

518
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,809
and it was wrong
of me to presume.

519
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,978
♪

520
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Was that really
so tough, sweetie?

521
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:17,652
Look, I know this
is a tricky subject,

522
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,120
but my friend's life
is in danger,

523
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:21,322
and I need to talk
to you about Joe.

524
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:22,824
Joe.
Oh!

525
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,492
I love Joe!

526
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:28,329
Would you hand me
that minced parrot, please?

527
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:29,831
Wait.
I don't understand.

528
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,216
I thought you wouldn't
want Dad to hear.

529
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,668
Why on earth not?

530
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,004
Because it could
destroy your marriage.

531
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,174
What?
Your father loves Joe.

532
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:40,475
I don't understand.

533
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,726
I thought you were
hiding him from him.

534
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:43,011
Nope.

535
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:46,314
Alice, you make me
sound so melodramatic.

536
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,150
Fine, yes, sure.

537
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,319
At first, yeah,

538
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,188
your father
was a touch sensitive,

539
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,356
but then he figured out

540
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,192
that Joe could work
for both of us,

541
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:59,244
so now he's our third,

542
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,699
you know, in a sort of
polyamorous-triad sense.

543
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:07,419
- So you and Joe and--
- Yeah.

544
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:09,421
Joe's anatomy is adaptable.

545
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:11,039
He's like a Swiss Army knife.

546
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,174
He's good for every occasion.

547
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,845
So whatever do you
want with Joe?

548
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,215
- I need his help.
- Oh, sweetie.

549
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,434
I'm sure Quentin
will understand.

550
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:37,232
You see two of you too, right?

551
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:39,067
Okay, good.

552
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,799
This stuff is finally
starting to wear off.

553
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:44,906
Margo.

554
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:46,074
Uh, I can explain.

555
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:49,744
Explain this, you dick!

556
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,298
Hi.

557
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,049
I'm Eliot.

558
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:58,920
So what's up?
How can I help?

559
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,755
Please know I'm
a certified therapist at home

560
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,257
as well as here.

561
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,475
You can trust me completely.

562
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,093
No, no, no.

563
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,762
Like I said, our friend
is trapped in the Neitherlands.

564
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:10,265
- Uh, acquaintance.
- That place is the worst.

565
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:12,150
So confusing.

566
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,602
Not to mention those fountains.
Completely unpredictable.

567
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:17,655
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

568
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,774
Could you, like, draw us a map?

569
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:22,944
Yeah, I guess.

570
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:24,412
It's not gonna do
your friend any good

571
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:26,915
if he's very far
from the Earth fountain,

572
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,167
although I might have something
that could help with that.

573
00:28:29,202 --> 00:28:31,119
Great.
What?

574
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:32,670
It's a beacon.

575
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:34,289
You cast it here,
and the fountain

576
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,007
for this world lights up there.

577
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,792
Okay, so how do we cast it?

578
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:41,179
Well, there are some
specific requirements...

579
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:43,765
sexually speaking.

580
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,136
Wait.
It's sex magic?

581
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,138
All magic where I'm from
is sex magic.

582
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,442
Thought you knew that.

583
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:56,811
I could perform it with you
if you'd prefer.

584
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:58,446
I'm a heck of a pinch hitter.

585
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,648
Think we've got this.

586
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,283
All right.
Suit yourself.

587
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,319
I sense a nice connection
between your genitals.

588
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,703
You should be fine.

589
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,989
You just need some blood,

590
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,490
a globe,

591
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:11,326
a few candles bound with twine.

592
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:15,997
Oh, and you both have
to climax at the same time.

593
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,967
That gonna be a problem?

594
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,336
- No.
- Well...

595
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:23,671
What?

596
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:26,140
I'm sorry.

597
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:28,643
We need the spell to work,
right?

598
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,180
I can't believe
I'm letting your boyfriend

599
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,437
talk to my boyfriend
about how to--

600
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,063
ugh.

601
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,398
I've never been prouder,

602
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,284
although I must say

603
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,954
this one seems like
an awful lot of work.

604
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,739
Who? Quentin?

605
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,207
You're complicated.

606
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:56,043
You need somebody
who gets that about you.

607
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,714
Maybe several people.

608
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:01,109
Don't take this
the wrong way, Mom,

609
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,084
but shut the fuck up, okay?

610
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,638
We'll talk
when you're less cranky.

611
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,268
Cheers.

612
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:26,741
Darling.

613
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:28,242
Are you okay?

614
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:29,493
No.

615
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:30,945
I'm not okay, you dick.

616
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,664
- You stole my life force.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,500
Uh, there was a tiny hole
in the casting.

618
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,619
I've corrected it.
Won't happen again.

619
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,421
Shouldn't have happened at all.

620
00:30:40,456 --> 00:30:42,490
I begged you to stay.

621
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:44,792
Margo, I--I needed you.

622
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:45,960
You broke my heart.

623
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,261
The only way I could repair it

624
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:50,998
was to create my golem of you.

625
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:53,851
A golem of Margo.

626
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,470
A Margolem.

627
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:59,273
You selfish prick.

628
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,808
You put my life at risk

629
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,477
so you could have
a realistic-looking sex doll?

630
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,479
No, no, no.
I--

631
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,981
I wanted a relationship.

632
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,983
Margo...

633
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:10,618
I love you.

634
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,870
And sometimes the only thing
that we do is spoon and--

635
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,540
You're gross.

636
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm taking the Margolem,
and I'm going to destroy it,

637
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,829
and I hope no one ever
spoons you again.

638
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:28,887
What?

639
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:32,390
What are you doing?

640
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,558
Nothing.

641
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:37,511
I brought you to support me
while I fight with my ex,

642
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:39,063
not do lines with the golem.

643
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,648
Oh, I'm sorry.

644
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,683
I thought this is how
we support each other.

645
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:45,019
Is there something
you want to say to me, Eliot?

646
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,738
No.

647
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,690
What is there to say?

648
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,859
I like your golem.

649
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:55,696
Life is a unicorn
shitting rainbows of candy.

650
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,368
I'll, um...

651
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,754
I'll deal with
the Margolem myself.

652
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,539
Just go home, Eliot.

653
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:14,181
You have the most
beautiful hair.

654
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,553
And your eyes are, like,

655
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,522
the perfect shade of blue.

656
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:24,608
And you're also smart.

657
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,227
Okay, okay.

658
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,529
It kind of feels like you're
trying to do a thing here.

659
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,531
I...

660
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:34,452
I was told that women like it
when you compliment them.

661
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,872
Yeah, but it has
to feel real, you know?

662
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,910
Since when is that an issue?

663
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,245
What is that supposed to mean?

664
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:45,463
Nothing.

665
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:51,585
Apparently you can't,
you know, with me.

666
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,220
Not that you'd ever
said that to my face.

667
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,755
Yeah, well, maybe you
should pay better attention

668
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,057
when we're having sex.

669
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:57,975
I thought I was.
I don't...

670
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,477
think that I've ever paid
that much attention

671
00:32:59,512 --> 00:33:01,429
to anything in my life,

672
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,431
and little did I know that you
were so incredibly convincing.

673
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,099
But isn't that what
you want, Quentin, huh?

674
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:07,268
To feel like you're perfect
at it every time?

675
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,103
No, not if I'm not.
I want--

676
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,771
How am I supposed to get better

677
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,240
if you won't tell me
if I'm doing it wrong?

678
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,331
So have you, like,

679
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,166
ever come when we're together?

680
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,168
Yes.

681
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,921
Lots of times.

682
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:28,789
I mean it.

683
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,175
It's just sometimes...

684
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,628
sometimes it's not that easy,

685
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,180
you know,
like when we were foxes.

686
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,300
Well, I'm sorry I'm not a fox.

687
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,308
Well, there goes the mood.

688
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,877
Voilà.

689
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,963
Reverse entropy.

690
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:12,383
Spell number 12, done and done.

691
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,502
Hard to believe something
so kludgy even works.

692
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,056
Perfect timing.
Pizza.

693
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,515
A large half veggie, half meat.

694
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,400
Thank you.

695
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,742
Kady.

696
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,027
Do you see that?

697
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,705
Okay, what just happened?

698
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,509
Déjà vu.

699
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:56,927
Uh-huh.

700
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:07,221
A large half veggie, half meat.

701
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:11,775
Thank you.

702
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:17,398
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

703
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,732
Could it be the entropy spell?

704
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,234
No.

705
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:23,787
No, this is time magic--
much more power involved.

706
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:26,240
Well, if we didn't
cast it, who did?

707
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:29,578
Yeah!

708
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,276
Okay.

709
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,808
Sit.
Let's talk.

710
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,309
You've leveled up.

711
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,844
It's time.

712
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:41,396
No pun intended.

713
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,850
Not to state the obvious,

714
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:46,518
but we are pushing
the boundaries

715
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,237
of what is magically possible.

716
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,689
We are working our way up
to the energetic glass ceiling

717
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,324
so we can shatter it.

718
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,659
You say that like it's possible.

719
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,527
It is.

720
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,496
Well, not according
to Brakebills.

721
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,031
No, the glass ceiling is

722
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,667
explode and turn into
a niffin or something.

723
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:02,868
You can't just keep ramping.

724
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,703
Brakebills was right

725
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,755
if you go by
Brakebills' methods.

726
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,241
We have a whole new methodology.

727
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:10,592
Yeah, but why?

728
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:11,927
I mean, what are you
trying to do?

729
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,512
And don't just say
"good things."

730
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,097
You're talking about
massive nuclear power.

731
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,933
You're right.
It's personal. Yeah.

732
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,686
We are the best Magicians
we know.

733
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,555
Silver can literally
fly to the moon.

734
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:27,943
But Menolly is dying,
and we can't cure her.

735
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,529
You know, Bender's trying
to stay off the ledge every day.

736
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,365
His meds have stopped working.

737
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,367
And you?

738
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,036
Eight years ago,
I was a drug addict,

739
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:41,073
and I left my son

740
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,909
in a hot car.

741
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,246
And he was eight months old.

742
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,582
My life was destroyed.

743
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:53,752
Jesus.

744
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,971
You're doing time magic

745
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,556
to change what you did.

746
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,092
Yeah, but only a fluke
natural-born time witch

747
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,593
could do something like that.

748
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,229
Now, I have done
all the research there is,

749
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:08,433
and one day, I realized
I was looking at it wrong.

750
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:11,270
We don't have the energy,

751
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:13,405
but it's not that
we need to generate it,

752
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,607
because somebody already has it.

753
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,243
We just need them,
and they can give us

754
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,579
inexhaustible,
unimaginable power.

755
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,116
That's no one.

756
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:26,118
That's the Source.

757
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,453
That's the place
it all comes from,

758
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,838
how people used to get shit done

759
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,007
when they needed
a fucking miracle.

760
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,126
- The divine.
- You're trying to...

761
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:38,931
Summon a god.

762
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:46,972
Your fave.

763
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,112
I'm sorry.

764
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,484
Can we really talk, baby?

765
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:07,659
I think Professor Lipson
could have been wrong about me.

766
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,496
I think something
might really be broken.

767
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,593
What the fuck?

768
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,513
Oh, Jesus.

769
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,815
There she is.

770
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,151
She has a bad habit
of walking off,

771
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,853
although when she does,

772
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:38,023
it's nice to be reminded
I have a great ass.

773
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:40,859
I thought you were
going to destroy her.

774
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,995
Oh, I was, but then I thought

775
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,247
I'd keep her around
a little longer.

776
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,782
She might come in handy.

777
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,838
What were you two talking about?

778
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,206
Nothing.

779
00:38:57,594 --> 00:38:59,594
Got these for you, bitch.

780
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,179
Aww.

781
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,681
Thanks, bitch.

782
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:05,300
We need a chaser.

783
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:13,275
What did you do?

784
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,227
Hmm?

785
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,664
So I'm a dick.

786
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,968
I'm insecure, and I suck,

787
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,753
so if we could just
give this another go,

788
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:44,589
I'll even--I don't know.

789
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,392
I'll be more fox-like
if that's what you want.

790
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,394
I don't want that.

791
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
I don't get it, Alice.

792
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:56,068
I'm not amazing at magic,

793
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,771
and apparently,
I'm pretty patchy at this.

794
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:05,110
Why are you even with me?

795
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,245
Because I like you.

796
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,447
A lot.

797
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:09,448
And I don't know why.

798
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,666
I just really, really do

799
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,119
in the weirdest way.

800
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:16,121
I don't think we're
supposed to like people

801
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,789
for what they're good at.

802
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:21,293
I think that's something
we make up to torture ourselves.

803
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:24,429
What about what we're bad at?

804
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:28,016
You--you're not
bad at sex.

805
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,103
Okay, I'm just bad
at asking for what I want.

806
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,772
It's embarrassing.

807
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,108
- It's me, Vix.
- I know.

808
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:39,361
I know. I know.

809
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,113
And I love you.

810
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,483
And so as far as I'm concerned,

811
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:47,319
you know, let's just do this.

812
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,988
Oh.

813
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,157
Okay.
Me too.

814
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,458
You.

815
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:58,213
Maybe just kiss me?

816
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,746
No.

817
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:32,831
There.

818
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,546
Bite me.

819
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:05,030
Oh, Quentin, you girly
fanboy piece of shit.

820
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,448
You did it.

821
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,054
Whoa.

822
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:34,559
Welcome back.

823
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,262
