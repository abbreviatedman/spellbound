00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,729
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,795
Hey, would you break up with me

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,150
if I told you that I've never
been happier in my entire life?

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,109
<i>You wished my boyfriend away.</i>

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,303
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

6
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,539
Other people aren't
supposed to get between us.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,619
<i>This is the most
pathetic loser dream ever.</i>

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,212
This is all in your
head. I'm in your head.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,621
Marina didn't betray my mom.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,158
She cleaned up her mess.

11
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,785
<i>But you know who has a
ton of new stuff? Marina.</i>

12
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,325
Run.

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,296
Hannah! Help!

14
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,959
There are good
people out there, Julia.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,334
People trying to learn about the
world and make it a better place.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,601
I need a key to unlock
the door to Fillory.

17
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,464
<i>Let's see this button.</i>

18
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,765
Where the hell am I?

19
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,198
Hi.

20
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,899
I come in peace.

21
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,668
Do you talk?

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,603
Haven't seen you
around here before.

23
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,480
First-timer. From?

24
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,849
Not here. You?

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,647
Hmm, nice try, psychic.

26
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,168
Gonna need to get to
know a girl a little better

27
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,669
before she lets you go
running around up there.

28
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,788
Yeah, I wasn't. You
were, but it's okay.

29
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,028
Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

30
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,897
I'm Eve. Penny.

31
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,764
Do you live here? Mmm-hmm.

32
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,398
Born and raised.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,638
I'm actually kind of the
Welcome Committee.

34
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,041
I keep track of the fountains.
I felt you come through.

35
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,022
Please, tell me that I can help
you get where you need to go.

36
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,912
Okay, where are we, exactly?

37
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,809
The Neitherlands.

38
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,182
And that is...

39
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,852
The Neitherlands are
sort of the place between

40
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,946
all other places.

41
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,152
It's how you get
from "A" to "B."

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,720
Which fountain did
you come out of?

43
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,428
Over there. Earth. Ooh.

44
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,542
You know, we don't get
too many of you guys,

45
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,229
but when you come, you always
have the most interesting magic.

46
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,499
So, tell me, what
brought you here?

47
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,734
Hmm?

48
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,334
I've pretty much seen it
all. Enchanted capes, rings.

49
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,575
This one guy, uh, he rode
a sled pulled by flying...

50
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,344
What do you call them?
Not zebra. Reindeer.

51
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,050
Santa Claus? Yeah.

52
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,498
You know him? He's
a really nice guy, right?

53
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,252
Yeah. No. What?

54
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,124
No, I didn't have anything
like that. Just a button.

55
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,920
That's new. Can I see it?

56
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,918
God damn it.

57
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,329
Oh, my God.

58
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,855
What?

59
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,124
I need your help
to fix the hyperdrive

60
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,722
and get a message to my friends.

61
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,126
I can help you if you
help me find my dragons.

62
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,196
Let's do it.

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,466
Let's find your
dragons, and I...

64
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,971
Oh, hey, look. I respect
the shit out of you both,

65
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,311
and you are leaders, and
you're people, and I'm a feminist...

66
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,960
If you would just shut
up for two seconds,

67
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,180
this sex dream would pass
the Bechdel test, Quentin.

68
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,277
God.

69
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,457
Nice dream, loser.

70
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,794
Why do you ruin
everything in my life?

71
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,170
Alice.

72
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,909
I just talked to Penny.

73
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,345
Wait, what? Where is
he? What happened?

74
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,175
It's not what it looks like.

75
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:19,117
I mean, it looks like a
grade-A nerd-boy wet dream,

76
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,517
and I want... God, I
want to make fun of you,

77
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,523
but the more I consider it,

78
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,354
you might be
some kind of savant.

79
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,988
Look. Where have you been?

80
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,992
So, wait. I was
making out with who?

81
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,024
Uh, nobody.

82
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,810
You said I was there
making out with someone.

83
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,063
No. Yes. Not...

84
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,501
I mean, not that it's important.

85
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,533
It was, sort of... Julia. Julia.

86
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,234
Your lifelong crush.

87
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,334
Dreams are weird.
People are naked,

88
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,379
and animals are
smoking cigarettes.

89
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,073
I... Look. Here's
what's important.

90
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,477
You've been gone for six weeks.

91
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,347
No, I've been gone six hours.

92
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,347
Shit.

93
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,820
Where are you, anyway?

94
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,188
The Neitherlands.

95
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,818
I thought it might
be some Fillory shit.

96
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,721
I mean, it sounds
familiar, but...

97
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,321
It's, like, fountains
and plazas up the ass,

98
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,409
and then the fountains,
they all go to different worlds.

99
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,710
I'll check the books
when I wake up.

100
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,879
Man, the one time I need you
to know this Comic-Con shit.

101
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,447
Why don't you just jump
back into the Earth fountain?

102
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,598
'Cause I'm lost.

103
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,183
There's three
moons here, Quentin.

104
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,369
My internal compass is
having a grand mal seizure.

105
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,954
Okay, so, why don't
you just travel back here?

106
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,255
If you can <i>Inception</i>
me from there...

107
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,440
I can't aim.

108
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,914
If I try to travel back,
I could end up dead.

109
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,647
Look. I need your help.

110
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,220
What do we know about
these Neitherlands?

111
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,625
I don't remember them
from the Fillory books.

112
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,753
There's not much.

113
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,540
In <i>The Wandering
Dune,</i> Jane and Rupert

114
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,590
meet this talking dromedary
named Cameltoes.

115
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,794
No. Seriously?

116
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,895
Amazing. It was 1943.

117
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,337
It wasn't a dirty thing
to say back then.

118
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,568
Anyway, he talks about
a world between worlds,

119
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,804
and then he
vanishes, and that's it.

120
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,778
I might know somebody
who can help us,

121
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,846
who's traveled.

122
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,347
You've never
mentioned that before.

123
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,646
We've never been
this desperate before.

124
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,828
Okay, so we're all in agreement.

125
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,515
We should ask the lizard man.

126
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,783
What?

127
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,722
The lizard man over there.

128
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,292
Eliot. Honey, what are you on?

129
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,091
Some pinks, a green,

130
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,998
and a tab of something
called "Chocolate Sunshine."

131
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,468
I really like the name.
Do you like the name?

132
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,003
Uh.

133
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,803
Maybe I shouldn't
have had that green.

134
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,435
Maybe you should get
checked out at the infirmary.

135
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,507
That's nonsense.

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,776
Me strong like bull.

137
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,946
Let's go on a quest.

138
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,389
Uh, you two go talk
to Alice's whatever.

139
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,323
Eliot, honey, maybe you and
I should go upstairs and rest.

140
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,986
Wait, wait, wait.

141
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,654
Are my eyes open,
or closed right now?

142
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,688
Oh, my God.

143
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
How about now?

144
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,736
Shit.

145
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,051
Over there. Come on, let's go.

146
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,228
Whoa!

147
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,179
Shit. Uh, coming!

148
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,178
Don't worry. It's only me.

149
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,916
I was just checking the Free
Trader app to see if you'd imploded.

150
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:16,989
I kept that offline.

151
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,852
Uh, so, what do I call you?

152
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,295
Like, "Richard" or,
um, "Failstaff" or...

153
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,929
Richard, though
some of the others

154
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,399
might prefer their log-in names.

155
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,698
Hey, when was the
last time you unplugged?

156
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,432
It's been a while.

157
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,996
But, I mean, when
was the last time

158
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,011
I had actual friends to discuss
<i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i> with?

159
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,843
But listen. The portals are gonna
take me a couple hours to calculate

160
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,440
if you want to, you
know, straighten up.

161
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,575
Thank God.

162
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,062
Listen, do you mind
if we commandeer

163
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,055
the guest room for the project?

164
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,316
Um...

165
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,255
What project? A-ha.

166
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,522
You and Asmodeus will learn
more once you've leveled up.

167
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,996
The next 12 spells. No mistakes.

168
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,398
Wow.

169
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,535
The... Um...

170
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,532
The, um, "Spellbinder"?

171
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,771
I mean, it was right there.

172
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Mmm.

173
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,907
Yeah, because it's a
binder filled with spells.

174
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,554
Hi.

175
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,696
You must be Vicious
Circe. I'm Silver.

176
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,930
Hi. JULIA: Bender.

177
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,029
Thanks for having me.

178
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm extremely happy finally
to meet you face-to-face.

179
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,986
I've taken the liberty of
writing a cooperative variation

180
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,070
on the spell I
sent you last week.

181
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,979
Menolly. Finally, in person.

182
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,445
How you feeling?

183
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,816
So good.

184
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,883
I am danked as
shit right now, girl.

185
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,048
The perks of chemo
just keep rolling in.

186
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,550
Hi.

187
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,559
Asmodeus is the last one.

188
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,993
She's actually just coming from
uptown, but rush hour, you know.

189
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,006
Hi. Asmodeus.

190
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,534
Welcome.

191
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,711
You two know each other.

192
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,385
Obviously, I didn't realize
that you two had history,

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,251
um, and I don't
want to dismiss it,

194
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,691
but we are running out of time
here, and we need both of you.

195
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,786
Okay?

196
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,089
Of course.

197
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,664
I've never been
to Chicago before.

198
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,500
This isn't Chicago,
it's the 'burbs.

199
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,184
We should make this fast. Maybe
you can wait outside while I run in.

200
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,219
Come on, Vix, when are you
gonna tell me who we're here to see?

201
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,302
What's the big secret?

202
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,845
Just let me do the talking.

203
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,719
Jesus, it's like the
TARDIS in here.

204
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,787
What kind of magic
are these people using?

205
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,695
Thibadeau's Planar Compression.

206
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,164
It's really not a big deal.

207
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,929
Alice, whose house
is this, exactly?

208
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,130
Alice.

209
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,870
Hi, Dad.

210
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,976
Come, come, come, come.

211
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,452
So glad you guys could
make it for the Veneralia,

212
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,489
the Roman festival of Venus.

213
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,451
Did Alice tell you I
study historical magic?

214
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,962
We celebrate all the
Roman holidays around here.

215
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,496
Jesus Christ, how
come you didn't tell me

216
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,642
we were coming
to see your parents?

217
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,877
Because I knew you'd make a
big deal out of it and act like this.

218
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:53,066
Well, I... So, they're Travelers?
Amongst other things?

219
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,383
No, my mom just
knows a Traveler.

220
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,569
Look, it's complicated.
Just let me handle it.

221
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,272
Really hope you can
come for the Saturnalia.

222
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,209
Much less tame
than this old thing.

223
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,781
Right. This is a
little tame. Hmm.

224
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,037
Dad, I need to talk to Mom,
like, now. It's important.

225
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,885
Well, after a frolic, she'll
usually head for the tepidarium.

226
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,477
Can you please
just call it "the bath"?

227
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,462
Nonsense. This is my domus.
I shall call it what I please.

228
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,796
Ugh.

229
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,330
Okay, look. Distract my dad.

230
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,870
I'll be 30 minutes, tops.

231
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,329
Please?

232
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,039
So, dating my daughter?

233
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,540
Let's have a
little fatherly chat.

234
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,323
I can't believe I gave up
tickets to <i>Hamilton</i> for this.

235
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,223
Um, sorry you
have to do your job.

236
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,194
Ugh, story of my life.

237
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,296
Anyway, there's
nothing wrong with him.

238
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,196
Really? Nothing at all?

239
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,168
Well, he has a
massive drug problem,

240
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,828
but at least he's
medicating, hmm?

241
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,604
Thank you. Hmm.

242
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,773
You, on the other hand, appear
to require medical intervention.

243
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,306
What?

244
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,514
That was me?

245
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,849
Yep.

246
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,755
Something's draining
her chi, her life force.

247
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,387
Or someone.

248
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,789
So, okay, I know that this is
embarrassing, but trust me, dying is worse.

249
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,500
Have you engaged in any
unprotected rituals of any kind?

250
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,628
Be honest.

251
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,070
God. That son of a bitch.

252
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,912
They're chanting something.

253
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,375
Look, we should get started.

254
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,008
We have a lot of
spells to get through.

255
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,852
You know, first, I
just want to be clear.

256
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:55,453
Richard might be about
forgiveness, but I'm sure as shit not.

257
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,087
Look, I'm sorry you and your
mom had a shitty relationship,

258
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,399
but not a day goes
by where I don't

259
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,458
feel terrible about
what happened to her.

260
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,932
I did not cause her death, okay?

261
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,938
I only wish that I
could've stopped it.

262
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,139
I'm just trying to
make up for my past,

263
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,608
just like you.

264
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,075
Did she suffer?

265
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,888
She said she loved you.

266
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,117
Yeah, I know she did.

267
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,293
So, are we gonna
do this, or what?

268
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,875
Whoa.

269
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,906
William. You're late.

270
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,177
I'm what? Who are you?

271
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,982
You always ask
the same questions.

272
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,680
I don't know what
you're talking about.

273
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,516
You never do. I'm a
member of The Order,

274
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,118
the keepers of the
libraries of the Neitherlands,

275
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,560
the greatest repository
of knowledge, full stop.

276
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,827
Any idea who the motherfuckers

277
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,958
in the hoods are that
are trying to kill me?

278
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,269
The locals used to work
for us in a custodial function,

279
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,967
but labor relations have
become somewhat strained of late.

280
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,737
We had to ban them
from the libraries.

281
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:18,954
They've been thoroughly cursed,

282
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,088
so they can't use the fountains,

283
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,741
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment,

284
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,614
some with a
particularly nasty entity.

285
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,319
The Beast?

286
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,550
Well, he has many names.

287
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,658
Look, this is all great,

288
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,819
but I'm just trying to get
back to the Earth fountain.

289
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,089
Can you show me where it is?

290
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,755
I suppose I could
order you a map,

291
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,470
but it'd have to come
from another branch.

292
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,932
Great, let's do that.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,520
Inter-library loans typically
take two to four weeks to process.

294
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,232
Are you kidding? That's
two years on my world.

295
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,774
Then, I'm afraid we are limited

296
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,242
to the resources of this branch.

297
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,279
Follow me.

298
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,049
Alice?

299
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,382
Hi, Mom.

300
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,956
Alice.

301
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,556
Fine.

302
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,592
Stephanie.

303
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,125
You know how I feel about "Mom."

304
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,265
I just... I have an important
question to ask you.

305
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,600
Sure.

306
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,302
Push past everything you left on
the table the last time we spoke.

307
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,604
I'm sure you've
forgotten all about it.

308
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,315
Oh, my God.

309
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,317
You're really not gonna
let that go, are you?

310
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,354
Because we haven't
finished discussing it.

311
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,820
It was six months ago.

312
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,119
Look, I just...

313
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,319
Mom... Stephanie,

314
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,275
I don't see the point
in talking about it.

315
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,200
We don't agree on it,
and we're never going to.

316
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,546
Well, because you act like
there's something wrong with me.

317
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,266
No, I just think it's weird that

318
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,830
you're not at all curious about
what happened to Charlie.

319
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,806
It's not gonna bring him back,

320
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,845
so I don't want to know.

321
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,041
Which is a perfectly
reasonable position

322
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,177
in spite of how you judge me.

323
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,915
Fine. Okay, fine.

324
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,287
Okay, I don't need
that patronizing tone.

325
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,087
Then what do you want from me?

326
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,716
How about... Hmm...

327
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,827
You admit that your
mother is a human being,

328
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,800
because you act like
you're the only one

329
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,631
who has a right to feel.

330
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,264
No, I don't.

331
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,435
I just...

332
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,236
Okay.

333
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,204
I think we're done talking.

334
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,717
This conversation has
worn me out entirely.

335
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,112
Excuse me.

336
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,905
Every second I spend
in this place, ugh,

337
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,070
I just feel like I'm being
pulled back into this

338
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,946
version of me when I was, like, 12
and furious and invisible and mute.

339
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,976
Ugh, she just fucking
does that to me.

340
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,785
Well, I'm sure being cooped
up in your old room helps.

341
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,689
It's like going back
in time to 2004.

342
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,420
The <i>Garden State</i> soundtrack.

343
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,086
Hey, that was cool
when it came out.

344
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,293
<i>The Joy of Sex?</i>

345
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,729
Is that Stephanie?

346
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,825
My dad.

347
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,396
He meant well.

348
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,770
But my mom made him give
me the version from the '70s,

349
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,571
because she thinks that kids
should know what pubic hair looks like.

350
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,838
Jesus Christ.

351
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,380
I can't imagine what you must
be thinking of me right now.

352
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:47,949
It's cool. I'm, like, really
into damaged chicks.

353
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,547
Like Julia?

354
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,902
Alice, I don't know what
you think Julia and I were,

355
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,522
but the truth is, we
weren't anything.

356
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,866
We were two kids
who tested well,

357
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,833
got placed together,
and I got a crush,

358
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,265
because that's
how hormones work,

359
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,735
and she didn't,
and I got over it,

360
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,533
and the end.

361
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,005
I'm kind of new to this whole
thing, if you hadn't guessed.

362
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,046
All my past
relationships were, like,

363
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,345
you know, at a party.

364
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,116
"Can we just do this
standing up?" kind of thing.

365
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,519
Well, the fact that you could
want to have sex with anyone

366
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,687
after living in this house
is pretty impressive.

367
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,825
Thanks.

368
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,971
So, what's the deal with this
Traveler? Why can't we just ask?

369
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,870
I mean...

370
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,411
Okay, so...

371
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,774
My mom knows this Traveler
from another world, Joe.

372
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,977
Joe? Yeah.

373
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,316
Apparently, his actual name
is impossible to pronounce.

374
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,218
Anyway, it's kind
of a touchy subject,

375
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,988
and I think that it's best
that when I talk to my mom,

376
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,058
my dad's not around.

377
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,156
Why? Is she sleeping with Joe?

378
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,231
And your dad doesn't know?

379
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,392
Alice, they were having

380
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,629
a sex party when we showed up.

381
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,768
Look, I know it
sounds ridiculous,

382
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,830
but my parents are weird

383
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,068
and possessive,

384
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,338
and they just have to
do everything together.

385
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,838
Look, when I was 10,

386
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,417
my dad caught my
mom having an affair,

387
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,418
and he threatened
to commit suicide.

388
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,418
Oh, my God.

389
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,117
He said he had to go extreme

390
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,353
just to get her
attention, which...

391
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,951
He was psychotic,

392
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,462
but he wasn't wrong.

393
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,096
I think he would have done
it if she hadn't come around.

394
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,496
Well...

395
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,304
Now I kind of feel like
a dick for making fun

396
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,472
of your <i>Garden State</i> soundtrack.

397
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,250
Total dick.

398
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,786
Now you have to help me.

399
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,179
I think that was one
of your memories.

400
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,896
Yeah.

401
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,838
Antarctica. Jesus.

402
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,401
What brought you there?

403
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,568
Brakebills.

404
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,242
So, what happened?

405
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,478
I mean, why'd you leave?

406
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,876
They found out my deal,

407
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,519
and it was either stay
and get brain-wiped, or jet.

408
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,815
I was heading to New York.

409
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,416
I was coming to kill Marina.

410
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,822
Well, then what happened?

411
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,823
I met Richard,

412
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,802
and he convinced
me Marina could wait,

413
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,931
and invited me to join
the Free Trader Beowulf,

414
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,043
which sounded...

415
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,873
I don't know, maybe, better than

416
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,674
death or jail, so...

417
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,213
Uh, everything okay in there?

418
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,811
Yeah. All good.

419
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,050
I know 100 ways to break in.

420
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,524
We have four spells
left. Let's just finish, okay?

421
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,186
Then they have to let
us in on their project.

422
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,731
Just a little further.

423
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,896
Wait a minute. I
know these people.

424
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,884
Well, every book is here.

425
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,108
All the books ever written,
all the books never written,

426
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,217
all the books of all the
people who ever lived.

427
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,205
This is my book.

428
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,772
Yo.

429
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,313
Why are there all these
flowers and shit on the cover?

430
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,050
People who read their
books often discover

431
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,217
they don't like the
main character,

432
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,958
and are rarely happy
with how it ends.

433
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,836
Ah. Here it is.

434
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,636
Wait, "Martin"? That's...

435
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,266
That's one of the Fillory kids.

436
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,387
Okay, is there anything
in there about The Beast?

437
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,141
I'm sorry. I can't
lend you this.

438
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,306
Not without a library card.

439
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,175
Of course, you can't.

440
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,687
You know, shit like this is
why people hate librarians.

441
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,222
What are you doing?

442
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,361
Here's what would happen if
you did what you're thinking.

443
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,796
You'd try to steal
this book by force,

444
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,833
we'd fight, you'd lose,

445
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,300
but you'd rip out several pages

446
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,099
before I banished
you from the library.

447
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,908
This way, no books get hurt.

448
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,857
Fuck.

449
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,283
I hate this place.

450
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,367
We always have so
much left over. Oh, here.

451
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,960
You have to try this. Mmm.

452
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,335
Filleted goat penis. Mmm.

453
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,842
Promotes virility, hmm?

454
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,707
That's very
thoughtful of you, Dad.

455
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:14,779
Oh.

456
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:21,010
So, Daniel, uh, you were saying

457
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,022
that your discipline
is in historical magic.

458
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,321
Indeed. Ah, the
Romans still fascinate me.

459
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,292
In fact, I'm about to
publish my third volume

460
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,160
on illusion work of
the Collis Aventinus.

461
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,357
Oh, could I see it?

462
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,425
Well, it's still in galleys,

463
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,799
but I suppose I
could show you...

464
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,303
Oh, great. Uh,
that sounds great.

465
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,861
Could we... Which...
Let's go now.

466
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,449
But you haven't even
touched your penis.

467
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,305
You know what? I had
a ton of it yesterday.

468
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,452
You said that it was this way.

469
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,342
Yeah, yeah. Uh, well...

470
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,583
Stephanie, I was wrong,
and you were right,

471
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:57,145
and I promise to be a
better daughter in the future.

472
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,281
Right about what?

473
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,426
I couldn't possibly
know how you feel,

474
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,463
other than that you feel deeply,

475
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,430
and you are your own person,

476
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,061
and you're the only one who
knows how to deal with your stuff,

477
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,264
and it was wrong
of me to presume.

478
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,008
Was that really
so tough, sweetie?

479
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,346
Look, I know this
is a tricky subject,

480
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,281
but my friend's
life is in danger,

481
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,908
and I need to talk
to you about Joe.

482
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,582
Joe. Oh, I love Joe!

483
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,857
Would you hand me that
minced parrot, please?

484
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,526
Wait. I don't understand. I thought
you wouldn't want Dad to hear.

485
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,525
Why on Earth not?

486
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,395
Because it could
destroy your marriage.

487
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,232
What? Your father loves Joe.

488
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,634
I don't understand. I thought
you were hiding him from him.

489
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,074
Nope. Alice, you make
me sound so melodramatic.

490
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,179
Fine, yes, sure.

491
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:58,115
At first, yeah, your father
was a touch sensitive,

492
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,185
but then he figured out

493
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,244
that Joe could
work for both of us.

494
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,683
So, now he's our third,

495
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:09,556
you know, in a sort of
polyamorous triad sense.

496
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,522
So, you and Joe and... Yeah.

497
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,189
Joe's anatomy is adaptable.

498
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,831
He's like a Swiss Army knife.

499
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,529
He's good for every occasion.

500
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,829
So, whatever do
you want with Joe?

501
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,102
I need his help.

502
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,268
Oh, sweetie.

503
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,142
I'm sure Quentin
will understand.

504
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,789
You see two of you, too, right?

505
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,423
Okay, good. This stuff is
finally starting to wear off.

506
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,396
Margo.

507
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,426
Uh, I can explain.

508
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,028
Explain this, you dick!

509
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,143
Hi. I'm Eliot.

510
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,249
So, what's up? How can I help?

511
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,081
Please know I'm a certified
therapist at home as well as here.

512
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,087
You can trust me completely.

513
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,213
No, no, no.

514
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,622
Like I said, our friend is
trapped in the Neitherlands.

515
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,523
Acquaintance. That
place is the worst.

516
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,895
So confusing.

517
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,339
Not to mention those fountains.

518
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,797
Completely unpredictable.

519
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,733
Wait, so, you know your
way around the Neitherlands?

520
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,041
Could you, like, draw us a map?

521
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,498
Yeah, I guess. Of what I know.

522
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,350
It's not gonna do
your friend any good

523
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,138
if he's very far from
the Earth fountain,

524
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,255
although, I might have
something that could help with that.

525
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,508
Great. What?

526
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,715
It's a beacon.

527
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,981
You cast it here, and the fountain
for this world lights up there.

528
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,778
Okay, so how do we cast it?

529
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,856
Well, there are some
specific requirements,

530
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,924
sexually speaking.

531
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,491
Wait. It's sex magic?

532
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,291
All magic where I'm
from is sex magic.

533
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,635
Thought you knew that.

534
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,224
I could perform it
with you if you'd prefer.

535
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,340
I'm a heck of a pinch hitter.

536
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,570
I think we've got this.

537
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,078
All right, suit yourself.

538
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,507
I sense a nice connection between
your genitals. You should be fine.

539
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,344
You just need
some blood, a globe,

540
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,485
a few candles
bound with twine. Oh!

541
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:21,026
And you both have to
climax at the same time.

542
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,018
That gonna be a problem?

543
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,189
No. Well...

544
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:27,732
What?

545
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,928
I'm sorry.

546
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,501
We need the
spell to work, right?

547
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,688
I can't believe I'm
letting your boyfriend

548
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,912
talk to my boyfriend
about how to...

549
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,419
Ugh.

550
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:49,781
Is this the...

551
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:50,914
That's the deal.

552
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,753
Although, I must say,

553
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,453
this one seems like
an awful lot of work.

554
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,194
Who? Quentin?

555
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,561
You're complicated.

556
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,794
You need somebody
who gets that about you.

557
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,232
Maybe several people.

558
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,938
Don't take this the
wrong way, Mom,

559
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,599
but shut the fuck up, okay?

560
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,178
We'll talk when
you're less cranky.

561
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,789
Cheers.

562
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,123
Darling.

563
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,658
Are you okay?

564
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:35,996
No.

565
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,534
I'm not okay, you dick.

566
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,070
You stole my life force.

567
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,537
I'm sorry.

568
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,137
Uh, there was a tiny
hole in the casting.

569
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,040
I've corrected it.
Won't happen again.

570
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,850
Shouldn't have happened at all.

571
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,574
I begged you to stay.

572
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,543
Margo, I needed you.
You broke my heart.

573
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,176
The only way I could repair it

574
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,721
was to create my golem of you.

575
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,954
A golem of Margo.

576
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,188
A Margolem.

577
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,025
You selfish prick.

578
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,593
You put my life at risk,

579
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,135
so you could have a
realistic-looking sex doll?

580
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,604
No, no, no. I... I
wanted a relationship.

581
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:14,901
Margo,

582
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,098
I love you.

583
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,869
And sometimes the only
thing that we do is spoon and...

584
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:20,945
Ugh.

585
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,208
You're gross.

586
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,750
I'm taking the Margolem,
and I'm going to destroy it,

587
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,013
and I hope no one
ever spoons you again.

588
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:35,550
What?

589
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,358
What are you doing?

590
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,122
Nothing.

591
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,995
I brought you to support
me while I fight with my ex,

592
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,901
not do lines with a golem.

593
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,303
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this
is how we support each other.

594
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,673
Is there something you
want to say to me, Eliot?

595
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,536
No. What is there to say?

596
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,508
I like your golem.

597
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,112
Life is a unicorn shitting
rainbows of candy.

598
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,316
I'll, um...

599
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,720
I'll deal with the
Margolem myself.

600
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,828
Just go home, Eliot.

601
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,337
You have the
most beautiful hair.

602
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,642
And your eyes are, like,
the perfect shade of blue.

603
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,141
And you're also smart.

604
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,275
Okay, okay.

605
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,013
It kind of feels like you're
trying to do a thing here.

606
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,319
I was told that women like it

607
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,257
when you compliment them.

608
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,692
Yeah, but that has
to feel real, you know?

609
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,660
Since when is that an issue?

610
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,964
What is that supposed to mean?

611
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,197
Nothing.

612
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,937
Apparently, you can't,
you know, with me.

613
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,944
Not that you've ever
said that to my face.

614
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,289
Yeah, well, maybe you
should pay better attention

615
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,474
when we're having sex.

616
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,571
I thought I was.

617
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,640
I don't think that
I've ever paid

618
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,328
that much attention
to anything in my life,

619
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,263
and little did I know that you
were so incredibly convincing.

620
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,967
But isn't that what you
want, Quentin, huh?

621
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,082
To feel like you're
perfect at it every time?

622
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,922
No, not if I'm not. I want...

623
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,839
How am I supposed to get better

624
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,332
if you won't tell me
if I'm doing it wrong?

625
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,602
So, have you, like, ever
come when we're together?

626
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,370
Yes. Lots of times.

627
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,739
I mean it.

628
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,014
It's just, sometimes...

629
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,077
Sometimes it's not that easy.

630
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,844
You know, like
when we were foxes.

631
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,651
Well, I'm sorry I'm not a fox.

632
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,896
Well, there goes the mood.

633
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,850
<i>Voilà.</i>

634
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,815
Reverse entropy.

635
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,416
Spell number 12, done and done.

636
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,958
Hard to believe something
so kludgy even works.

637
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,462
Perfect timing. Pizza.

638
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,236
A large half veggie,
half meat. Thank you.

639
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,115
Kady.

640
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,212
Did you see that?

641
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,358
Okay, what just happened?

642
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,793
Déjà vu. Uh-huh.

643
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,444
A large half veggie, half meat.

644
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,139
Thank you.

645
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,287
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

646
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,120
Could it be the entropy spell?

647
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,683
No.

648
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,520
No, this is time magic,
much more power involved.

649
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,555
Well, if we didn't
cast it, who did?

650
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,326
Yeah!

651
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,597
We did it!

652
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:41,772
Okay.

653
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,967
Sit. Let's talk.

654
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,144
You've leveled up. It's time.

655
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,672
No pun intended.

656
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,249
Not to state the obvious,

657
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,445
but we are pushing

658
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,511
the boundaries of what
is magically possible.

659
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,090
We are working our way up
to the energetic glass ceiling,

660
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,750
so we can shatter it.

661
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,350
You say that like it's possible.

662
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,861
It is.

663
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,829
Well, not according
to Brakebills.

664
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,365
No, the glass ceiling is

665
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,957
"explode and turn into
a niffin," or something.

666
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,298
You can't just keep ramping.

667
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,101
Brakebills was right. If you
go by Brakebills' methods.

668
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,506
We have a whole new methodology.

669
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,170
Yeah, but why? I mean,
what are you trying to do?

670
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,525
And don't just
say "good things."

671
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,639
You're talking about
massive nuclear power.

672
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,344
You're right. It's
personal. Yeah.

673
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,910
We are the best
Magicians we know.

674
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,115
Silver can literally
fly to the moon.

675
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,551
But Menolly is dying,
and we can't cure her.

676
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,863
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

677
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,490
His meds have stopped working.

678
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,825
And you?

679
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,067
Eight years ago, I
was a drug addict,

680
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:50,466
and I left my son in a hot car.

681
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,212
And he was eight months old.

682
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,776
My life was destroyed.

683
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,509
Jesus.

684
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,651
You're doing time magic
to change what you did.

685
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,822
Yeah, but only a
fluke natural-born

686
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,656
time witch could do
something like that.

687
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,128
Now, I have done all
the research there is,

688
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,462
and one day,

689
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,626
I realized I was
looking at it wrong.

690
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,806
We don't have the energy, but
it's not that we need to generate it,

691
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,967
because somebody already has it.

692
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,443
We just need them,
and they can give us

693
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,810
inexhaustible,
unimaginable power.

694
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,008
That's no one.

695
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,178
That's the Source.

696
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,517
That's the place
it all comes from,

697
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,335
how people used to get shit done

698
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,187
when they needed
a fucking miracle.

699
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,426
The divine. You're trying to...

700
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,494
Summon a god.

701
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,032
Your fave.

702
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,305
I'm sorry.

703
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,115
Can we really talk, baby?

704
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,422
I think Professor Lipson

705
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,017
could have been wrong about me.

706
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:19,428
I think something
might really be broken.

707
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,807
What the fuck?

708
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:38,115
Oh, Jesus. There she is.

709
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,514
She has a bad
habit of walking off,

710
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,183
although when she does,

711
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,281
it's nice to be reminded
I have a great ass.

712
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,892
I thought you were
going to destroy her.

713
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,488
Oh, I was, but then I thought

714
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,657
I'd keep her around
a little longer.

715
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,097
She might come in handy.

716
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,283
What were you two talking about?

717
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,431
Nothing.

718
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,873
Got these for you, bitch.

719
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:08,946
Aw.

720
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:10,912
Thanks, bitch.

721
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,576
We need a chaser.

722
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,056
What did you do?

723
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:22,593
Hmm?

724
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,678
So, I'm a dick.

725
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,446
I'm insecure, and I suck.

726
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,148
So, if we could just give
this another go, I'll even...

727
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,068
I don't know. I'll
be more fox-like

728
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,651
if that's what you want.

729
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,025
I don't want that.

730
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,396
I don't get it, Alice. I'm
not amazing at magic,

731
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,633
and apparently, I'm
pretty patchy at this.

732
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,538
Why are you even with me?

733
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,136
Because I like you.

734
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,912
A lot. And I don't know why.

735
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,780
I just really, really do.

736
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,517
In the weirdest way.

737
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,682
I don't think we're supposed to
like people for what they're good at.

738
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,385
I think that's
something we make up

739
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,017
to torture ourselves.

740
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,094
What about what we're bad at?

741
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,267
You're not bad at sex.

742
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,328
Okay, I'm just bad at
asking for what I want.

743
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:40,804
It's embarrassing.

744
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,276
It's me, Vix. I know.

745
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,336
I know. I know.

746
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,370
And I love you.

747
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,877
And so, as far as I'm concerned,

748
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,852
you know, let's just do this.

749
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,486
Oh.

750
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,053
Okay. Me, too.

751
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,618
You.

752
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,058
Maybe just kiss me?

753
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,665
No. Here.

754
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,506
Bite me.

755
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,723
Oh, Quentin, you girly
fanboy piece of shit. You did it.

756
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,437
There he is!

757
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,839
Get him! Come on!

758
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,086
Whoa.

759
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:42,750
Welcome back.
