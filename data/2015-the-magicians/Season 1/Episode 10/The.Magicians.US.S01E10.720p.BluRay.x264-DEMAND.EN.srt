up with me

Yeah, I wasn't. You
were, but it's okay.

Amazing.
It was 1943.

126

It wasn't a dirty
thing to say back then.

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,562
Anyway, he talks about
a world between worlds,

128
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,802
and then he vanishes,
and that's it.

129
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,769

mentioned that before.

agreement.

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,966
and a tab of something
called "Chocolate Sunshine."

140
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,486

have had that green.

out at the infirmary.

app to see if you'd imploded.

161
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,961
I kept that offline.

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,847
Uh, so, what do
I call you?

163
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,322
Like, "Richard" or,
um, "Failstaff" or...

Richard, though
some of the others

165

might prefer
their log-in names.

time you unplugged?

was the last time

169
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,005
I had actual friends to discuss
Godel, Escher, Bach with?

170
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,845
But listen. The portals are gonna
take me a couple hours to calculate

know, straighten up.

172
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,601

if we commandeer

that you two had history,

want to dismiss it,

Sure.

let that go, are you?

Because we haven't
finished discussing it.

in talking about it.

We don't agree on it,
and we're never going to.

337
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,487
Well, because you act like
there's something wrong with me.

338
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,244
No, I just think
it's weird that

what happened to Charlie.

bring him back,

reasonable position

you judge me.

Okay.

356
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,727
This conversation has
worn me out entirely.

357

Excuse me.

358
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,887

Ugh, she just fucking
does that to me.

He meant well.

370
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,761
But my mom made him give me
the version from the '70s,

371
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,565
because she thinks that kids should
know what pubic hair looks like.

but the truth is,
we weren't anything.

378

We were two kids

379
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,849

382
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,524
and the end.

383
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,007
I'm kind of new to this whole
thing, if you hadn't guessed.

384
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,043

were, like,

you know, at a party.

386
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,131
"Can we just do this
standing up?" kind of thing.

Well, the fact that you could
want to have sex with anyone

388
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,683

394
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,769
My mom knows this Traveler
from another world, Joe.

395
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,966
Joe?
Yeah.

396
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,281
Apparently, his actual name
is impossible to pronounce.

397
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,203
Anyway, it's kind
of a touchy subject,

398
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,967
and I think that it's best
that when I talk to my mom,

399
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,041
my dad's not around.

400
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,164
Why? ls she
sleeping with Joe?

401
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,245
And your dad doesn't know?

402
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,408
Alice, they were having

403
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,642
a sex party when
we showed up.

404
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,769
Look, I know
it sounds ridiculous,

405
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,808
but my parents are weird

406
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,086
and possessive,

407
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,367

do everything together.

409
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,408
my dad caught my
mom having an affair,

410
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,403
and he threatened
to commit suicide.

411
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,400
Oh, my God.

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,126

go extreme

attention, which...

414
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,970
He was psychotic,

415
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,485
but he wasn't wrong.

416
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,083
I think he would have done it
if she hadn't come around.

417

that Joe could work
for both of us.

polyamorous triad sense.

So, you and Joe and...
Yeah.

Joe's anatomy is adaptable.

a Swiss Army knife.

every occasion.

you want with Joe?

around the Neitherlands?

draw us a map?

You cast it here, and the fountain
for this world lights up there.

Okay, so how do
we cast it?

I sense a nice connection between
your genitals. You should be fine.

happened at all.

I could repair it

Not to state
the obvious,

703
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,446
but we are pushing

704
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,522
the boundaries of what
is magically possible.

705
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,080
We are working our way up to
the energetic glass ceiling,

706
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,764
so we can shatter it.

707
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,330
You say that
like it's possible.

708
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,845
It is.

709
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,843
Well, not according
to Brakebills.

710
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,365
No, the glass
ceiling is

711
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,966
"explode and turn into a
niffin," or something.

712
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,280
You can't just
keep ramping.

713
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,081
Brakebills was right. If you
go by Brakebills' methods.

714
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,527
We have a whole
new methodology.

715
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,171
Yeah, but why? I mean,
what are you trying to do?

716
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,520
And don't just say
"good things."

717
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,648
You're talking about
massive nuclear power.

718
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,371
You're right.
It's personal. Yeah.

719
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,886
We are the best
Magicians we know.

720
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,122
Silver can literally
fly to the moon.

721
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,567
But Menolly is dying,
and we can't cure her.

722
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,883
Bender's trying to stay off
the ledge every day.

723
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,486
His meds have
stopped working.

724
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,847
And you?

725
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,087
Eight years ago,
I was a drug addict,

726
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,445
and I left my son
in a hot car.

727
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,203
And he was eight months old.

728
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,803
My life was destroyed.

729
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,527
Jesus.

730
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,646
You're doing time magic
to change what you did.

731
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,803
Yeah, but only
a fluke natural-born

732
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,644
time witch could do
something like that.

733
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,127
Now, I have done all
the research there is,

734
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,441
and one day,

735
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,648
I realized I was
looking at it wrong.

736
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,805
We don't have the energy, but it's
not that we need to generate it,

737
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,962
because somebody
already has it.

738
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,407
We just need them,
and they can give us

739
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,847
inexhaustible,
unimaginable power.

740
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,004
That's no one.

741
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,164
That's the Source.

742
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,527
That's the place
it all comes from,

743
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,280
how people used
to get shit done

744
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,164
when they needed
a fucking miracle.

745
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,443
The divine.
You're trying to...

746
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,523
Summon a god.

749
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,326
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,121
Can we really
talk, baby?

751
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,405
I think Professor Lipson

752
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,000
could have been
wrong about me.

753
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,448
I think something
might really be broken.

754
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,806
What the fuck?

755
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,130
Oh, Jesus. There she is.

756
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,527
She has a bad
habit of walking off,

757
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,164
although when she does,

758
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,289
it's nice to be reminded
I have a great ass.

759
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,926
I thought you were
going to destroy her.

760
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,488
Oh, I was,
but then I thought

761
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,688
I'd keep her around
a little longer.

762
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,091
She might come
in handy.

763
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,206
What were you
two talking about?

764
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,447
Nothing.

765
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,844
Got these
for you, bitch.

766
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,921
Aw.

767
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,931
Thanks, bitch.

768
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,601
We need a chaser.

769
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,085
What did you do?

770
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,601
Hmm?

773
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,451
I'm insecure, and I suck.

774
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,126
So, if we could just give
this another go, I'll even...

775
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,006
I don't know.
I'll be more fox-like

776
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,645
if that's what you want.

777
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,051
I don't want that.

I don't get it, Alice.
I'm not amazing at magic,

779

pretty patchy at this.

Why are you
even with me?

782
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,165
Because I like you.

783
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,921
A lot. And
I don't know why.

784
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,809
I just really,
really do.

785
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,523
In the weirdest way.

786
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,683
I don't think we're supposed to like
people for what they're good at.

787
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,410
I think that's
something we make up

788
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,005
to torture ourselves.

789
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,087

what we're bad at?

at sex.</i>

791
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,322
Okay, I'm just bad at
asking for what I want.

792
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,811
It's embarrassing.

793

It's me, Vix.
I know.

I'm concerned,

797

let's just do this.
