00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,150
if I told you that I've never
been happier in my entire life?

Yeah, I wasn't. You
were, but it's okay.

I keep track of the fountains.
I felt you come through.

you come out of?

too many of you guys,

brought you here?

want to make fun of you,

89
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,992

making out with who?

what's important.

meet this talking dromedary

No. Seriously?

125
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,895
Amazing. It was 1943.

126

It wasn't a dirty thing
to say back then.

127

Anyway, he talks about
a world between worlds,

128
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,804
and then he
vanishes, and that's it.

mentioned that before.

Okay, so we're all in agreement.

134
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,515
We should ask the lizard man.

135
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,783
What?

00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,998
and a tab of something
called "Chocolate Sunshine."

140
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,468

have had that green.

checked out at the infirmary.

I should go upstairs and rest.

161
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:16,989
I kept that offline.

162
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,852
Uh, so, what do I call you?

163
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,295
Like, "Richard" or,
um, "Failstaff" or...

164

Richard, though
some of the others

165

might prefer their log-in names.

last time you unplugged?

was the last time

169

I had actual friends to discuss

170

take me a couple hours to calculate

know, straighten up.

if we commandeer

in talking about it.

there's something wrong with me.

354
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,236
Okay.

355
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,204
I think we're done talking.

356
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,717
This conversation has
worn me out entirely.

357
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,112
Excuse me.

358
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,905
Every second I spend
in this place, ugh,

359
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,070
I just feel like I'm being
pulled back into this

360
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,946
version of me when I was, like, 12
and furious and invisible and mute.

361
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,976
Ugh, she just fucking
does that to me.

362
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,785
Well, I'm sure being cooped
up in your old room helps.

My dad.

369
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,396
He meant well.

370
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,770
But my mom made him give
me the version from the '70s,

371
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,571
because she thinks that kids
should know what pubic hair looks like.

372
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,838
Jesus Christ.

373
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,380
I can't imagine what you must
be thinking of me right now.

374
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:47,949
It's cool. I'm, like, really
into damaged chicks.

375
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,547

376
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,902
Alice, I don't know what
you think Julia and I were,

377
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,522
but the truth is, we
weren't anything.

378
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,866
We were two kids
who tested well,

379
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,833
got placed together,
and I got a crush,

380
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,265
because that's
how hormones work,

381
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,735
and she didn't,
and I got over it,

382
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,533
and the end.

383
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,005
I'm kind of new to this whole
thing, if you hadn't guessed.

384
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,046
All my past
relationships were, like,

385
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,345
you know, at a party.

386
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,116
"Can we just do this
standing up?" kind of thing.

387
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,519
Well, the fact that you could
want to have sex with anyone

388
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,687
after living in this house
is pretty impressive.

391
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,971
So, what's the deal with this
Traveler? Why can't we just ask?

392
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,870
I mean...

393
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,411
Okay, so...

394
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,774
My mom knows this Traveler
from another world, Joe.

395
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,977
Joe? Yeah.

396
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,316
Apparently, his actual name
is impossible to pronounce.

397
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,218
Anyway, it's kind
of a touchy subject,

398
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,988
and I think that it's best
that when I talk to my mom,

399
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,058
my dad's not around.

400
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,156
Why? Is she sleeping with Joe?

401
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,231
And your dad doesn't know?

402
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,392
Alice, they were having

403
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,629
a sex party when we showed up.

404
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,768
Look, I know it
sounds ridiculous,

405
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,830
but my parents are weird

406
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,068
and possessive,

407
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,338
and they just have to
do everything together.

408
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,838
Look, when I was 10,

409
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,417
my dad caught my
mom having an affair,

410
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,418
and he threatened
to commit suicide.

411
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,418
Oh, my God.

412
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,117
He said he had to go extreme

413
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,353
just to get her
attention, which...

414
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,951
He was psychotic,

415
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,462
but he wasn't wrong.

416
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,096
I think he would have done
it if she hadn't come around.

417
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,496
Well...

418
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,304

Joe's anatomy is adaptable.

529
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,831
He's like a Swiss Army knife.

530
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,529
He's good for every occasion.

531
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,829
So, whatever do
you want with Joe?

532
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,102

will understand.

Uh, I can explain.

Explain this, you dick!

542
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,143
Hi. I'm Eliot.

543
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,249
So, what's up? How can I help?

544
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,081
Please know I'm a certified
therapist at home as well as here.

545

You can trust me completely.

546
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,213
No, no, no.

547
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,622
Like I said, our friend is
trapped in the Neitherlands.

548
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,523
Acquaintance. That
place is the worst.

549
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,895
So confusing.

550
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,339
Not to mention those fountains.

551
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,797
Completely unpredictable.

552
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,733
Wait, so, you know your
way around the Neitherlands?

553
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,041
Could you, like, draw us a map?

554
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,498
Yeah, I guess. Of what I know.

555
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,350
It's not gonna do
your friend any good

556
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,138
if he's very far from
the Earth fountain,

557
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,255

something that could help with that.

558

ALICE: Great. What?

559
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,715
It's a beacon.

560
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,981
You cast it here, and the fountain
for this world lights up there.

561
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,778
Okay, so how do we cast it?

562
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,856
Well, there are some
specific requirements,

563
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,924

564
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,491
Wait. It's sex magic?

565
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,291
All magic where I'm
from is sex magic.

566
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,635
Thought you knew that.

567
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,224
I could perform it
with you if you'd prefer.

568
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,340
I'm a heck of a pinch hitter.

569
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,570
I think we've got this.

570
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,078
All right, suit yourself.

571
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,507
I sense a nice connection between
your genitals. You should be fine.

572
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,344
You just need
some blood, a globe,

573
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,485
a few candles
bound with twine. Oh!

574
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:21,026
And you both have to
climax at the same time.

575
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,018
That gonna be a problem?

576
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,189
No. Well...

I'm sorry.

spell to work, right?

I can't believe I'm
letting your boyfriend

581

talk to my boyfriend
about how to...

582
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,419
Ugh.

586

an awful lot of work.

You're complicated.

589
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,794
You need somebody
who gets that about you.

590
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,232
Maybe several people.

wrong way, Mom,

I'm sorry.

602

Uh, there was a tiny
hole in the casting.

603
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,040
I've corrected it.
Won't happen again.

604
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,850
Shouldn't have happened at all.

605

Margo, I needed you.
You broke my heart.

The only way I could repair it

608

was to create my golem of you.

so you could have a
realistic-looking sex doll?

wanted a relationship.

00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,829
Well, not according
to Brakebills.

709
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,365
No, the glass ceiling is

710
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,957
"explode and turn into
a niffin," or something.

711
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,298
You can't just keep ramping.

712
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,101
Brakebills was right. If you
go by Brakebills' methods.

713
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,506
We have a whole new methodology.

714
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,170
Yeah, but why? I mean,
what are you trying to do?

715
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,525
And don't just
say "good things."

716
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,639
You're talking about
massive nuclear power.

717
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,344
You're right. It's
personal. Yeah.

718
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,910
We are the best
Magicians we know.

719
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,115
Silver can literally
fly to the moon.

720
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,551
But Menolly is dying,
and we can't cure her.

721
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,863
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

722
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,490
His meds have stopped working.

723
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,825
And you?

724
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,067
Eight years ago, I
was a drug addict,

725
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:50,466
and I left my son in a hot car.

726
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,212
And he was eight months old.

727
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,776
My life was destroyed.

728
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,509
Jesus.

729
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,651
You're doing time magic
to change what you did.

730
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,822
Yeah, but only a
fluke natural-born

731
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,656
time witch could do
something like that.

732
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,128
Now, I have done all
the research there is,

733
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,462
and one day,

734
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,626
I realized I was
looking at it wrong.

735
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,806
We don't have the energy, but
it's not that we need to generate it,

736
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,967
because somebody already has it.

737
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,443
We just need them,
and they can give us

738
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,810
inexhaustible,
unimaginable power.

739
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,008
That's no one.

740
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,178
That's the Source.

741
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,517
That's the place
it all comes from,

742
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,335
how people used to get shit done

743
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,187
when they needed
a fucking miracle.

744
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,426
The divine. You're trying to...

745
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,494
Summon a god.

746
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,032
Your fave.

747
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,610
(SIGHS)

748
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,305
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,115
Can we really talk, baby?

750
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,422
I think Professor Lipson

751
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,017
could have been wrong about me.

752
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:19,428
I think something
might really be broken.

753
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,807
What the fuck?

754
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:38,115
Oh, Jesus. There she is.

755
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,514
She has a bad
habit of walking off,

756
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,183
although when she does,

757
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,281
it's nice to be reminded
I have a great ass.

758
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,892
I thought you were
going to destroy her.

759
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,488
Oh, I was, but then I thought

760
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,657
I'd keep her around
a little longer.

761
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,097
She might come in handy.

762
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,283
What were you two talking about?

763
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,431
Nothing.

764
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,873
Got these for you, bitch.

765
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:08,946
Aw.

766
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:10,912
Thanks, bitch.

767
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,576
We need a chaser.

768
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,056
What did you do?

769
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:22,593
Hmm?

770
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,931
(DOOR OPENS)

771
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,678
So, I'm a dick.

772
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,446
I'm insecure, and I suck.

773
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,148
So, if we could just give
this another go, I'll even...

774
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,068
I don't know. I'll
be more fox-like

775
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,651
if that's what you want.

776
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,025
I don't want that.

777
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,396
I don't get it, Alice. I'm
not amazing at magic,

778
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,633
and apparently, I'm
pretty patchy at this.

779
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
(SIGHS)

780
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,538
Why are you even with me?

781
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,136
Because I like you.

782
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,912
A lot. And I don't know why.

783
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,780
I just really, really do.

784
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,517
In the weirdest way.

785
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,682
I don't think we're supposed to
like people for what they're good at.

786
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,385
I think that's
something we make up

787
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,017
to torture ourselves.

788
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,094
What about what we're bad at?

789
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,267
You're not bad at sex.

790
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,328
Okay, I'm just bad at
asking for what I want.

791
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:40,804
It's embarrassing.

792
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,276
It's me, Vix. I know.

793
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,336
I know. I know.

794
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,370
And I love you.

795
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,877
And so, as far as I'm concerned,

796
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,852
you know, let's just do this.

797
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,486
Oh.

798
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,053
Okay. Me, too.

799
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,618
You.

800
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,058
Maybe just kiss me?

801
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,665
No. Here.

802
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,506
Bite me.

fanboy piece of shit. You did it.
