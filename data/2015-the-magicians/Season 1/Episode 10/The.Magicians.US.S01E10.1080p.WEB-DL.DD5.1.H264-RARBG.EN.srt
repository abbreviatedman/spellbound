1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,883
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,884 --> 00:00:05,572
Hey, would you break up
with me if I told you

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,373
<i>that I have never been happier
in my entire life?</i>

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,044
<i>You wished my boyfriend away.</i>

5
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,511
Other people aren't supposed
to get between us.

7
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,651
<i>This is the most pathetic
loser dream ever.</i>

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,122
This is all in your head.
I'm in your head.

9
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:25,191
Marina didn't betray my mom;
she cleaned up her mess.

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,692
<i>Wait, you know
who has a ton of new stuff?</i>

11
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,794
<i>Marina.</i>

12
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,156
Run.

13
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,164
Help!
Help!

14
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,826
There are good people
out there, Julia,

15
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,704
people trying to learn
about the world

16
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,372
and make it a better place.

17
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:39,711
I need a key to unlock
the door to Fillory.

18
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,407
<i>Let's see this button.</i>

19
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,870
The hell am I?

20
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,228
Hi.

21
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,596
I come in peace.

22
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,577
Do you talk?

23
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,378
Haven't seen you
around here before.

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,880
First-timer.

25
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,816
From?

26
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,147
Not here.

27
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,152
You?

28
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,489
Eh, nice try, psychic.

29
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,091
Gonna need to get to know
a girl a little better

30
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,932
before she lets you go
running around up there.

31
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,127
- Yeah, I wasn't.
- You were, but it's okay.

32
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,102
Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

33
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:15,969
- I'm Eve.
- Penny.

34
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,000
- Do you live here?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,905
Born and raised.

36
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,637
I'm actually kind of
the welcome committee.

37
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,780
I keep track of the fountains.
I felt you come through.

38
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,577
Please tell me that I can help
you get where you need to go.

39
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,479
Okay, where are we exactly?

40
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,252
- The Neitherlands.
- And that is...

41
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:36,856
The Neitherlands are sort of
the placebetween all other places.

42
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,257
It's how you get from A to B.

43
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,761
Which fountain
did you come out of?

44
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,432
- Over there. Earth.
- Ooh.

45
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,601
You know, we don't get
too many of you guys,

46
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:49,640
but when you come, you always
have the most interesting magic.

47
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,167
So?

48
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,472
Tell me, what brought you here?

49
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,674
Hmm?

50
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,875
I've pretty much seen it all...

51
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,476
enchanted capes, rings.

52
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:00,378
This one guy, he rode a sled
pulled by flying...

53
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,681
what do you call them?

54
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,682
Not zebra.

55
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,118
Reindeer.

56
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,719
- Santa Claus?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,350
You know him?
He's a really nice guy, right?

58
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,485
Yeah.
No.

59
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,490
What? I...

60
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,962
No, I didn't have
anything like that.

61
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:14,160
Just a button.

62
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,191
That's new.

63
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,056
Can I see it?

64
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,921
God damn it.

65
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,358
Oh, my God.

66
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,288
What?

67
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,096
I need your help
to fix the hyperdrive

68
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,928
and get a message to my friends.

69
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,773
I can help you
if you help me find my dragons.

70
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,969
Let's do it.

71
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,243
Let's find your dragons,

72
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:37,477
and I... oh, hey, look.

73
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,908
I respect the shit
out of you both,

74
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,480
and you are leaders,

75
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,081
and you're people,
and I'm a feminist...

76
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,782
If you would just
shut up for two seconds,

77
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,594
this sex dream would pass
the Bechdel test, Quentin.

78
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:47,717
God.

79
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,423
Nice dream, loser.

80
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,755
Why do you ruin everything
in my life?

81
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,409
- Alice.
- Huh?

82
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,811
- I just talked to Penny.
- Wait, what?

83
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,747
Where is he?
What happened?

84
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,578
It's not what it looks like.

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,853
I mean, it looks like
a Grade A nerd-boy wet dream,

86
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:21,492
and I want... God, I want
to make fun of you,

87
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,456
but the more I consider it,

88
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,257
you might be
some kind of savant.

89
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,993
Look. Where have you been?

90
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,430
So wait.
I was making out with who?

91
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,798
Uh, nobody.

92
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,599
You said I was there
making out with someone.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,930
No. Yes.

94
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,465
Not... I mean, not
that it's important.

95
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,800
It was sort of Julia.

96
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,535
Julia.

97
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,107
Your lifelong crush.

98
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,138
Dreams are weird.
People are...

99
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,213
naked, and animals
are smoking cigarettes.

100
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,981
I... look.
Here's what's important.

101
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:48,450
You've been gone for six weeks.

102
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:51,319
No, I've been gone six hours.

103
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,521
Shit.

104
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,392
- Where are you, anyway?
- The Neitherlands.

105
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:59,891
I thought it might be
some Fillory shit.

106
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,631
Uh, I mean,
it sounds familiar, but...

107
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,896
It's, like, fountains
and plazas up the ass,

108
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,127
and then the fountains,
they all go to different worlds.

109
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,833
I'll check the books
when I wake up.

110
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,565
Man, the one time I need you
to know this Comic-Con shit.

111
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,300
Why don't you just jump back
into the Earth fountain?

112
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,835
'Cause I'm lost.

113
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,507
There's three moons here,
Quentin.

114
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,168
My internal compass is
having a grand mal seizure.

115
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,676
Okay, so why don't you
just travel back here?

116
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,008
If you can "Inception" me
from there...

117
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,412
I can't aim.

118
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,354
If I try to travel back,
I could end up dead.

119
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:29,316
Look.
I need your help.

120
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,991
What do we know
about these Neitherlands?

121
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,862
I don't remember them
from the "Fillory" books.

122
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,728
There's not much.

123
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,399
In "The Wandering Dune,"
Jane and Rupert

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,598
meet this talking dromedary
named Cameltoes.

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
No. Seriously?

126
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,571
- Amazing.
- It was 1943.

127
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:46,239
It wasn't a dirty thing
to say back then.

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,440
Anyway, he talks about
a world between worlds,

129
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,712
and then he vanishes,
and that's it.

130
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:53,381
I might know somebody
who can help us, who's traveled.

131
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,110
Well, you've never
mentioned that before.

132
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,875
Well, we've never been
this desperate before.

133
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,424
Okay, so we're all in agreement.

134
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:01,387
We should ask the lizard man.

135
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,218
What?

136
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,723
The lizard man over there.

137
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,086
Eliot.
Honey, what are you on?

138
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,955
Some pinks, a green,

139
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,733
and a tab of something called
"chocolate sunshine."

140
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,904
I really like the name.
Do you like the name?

141
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,872
Uh.

142
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,711
Maybe I shouldn't have
had that green.

143
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,808
Maybe you should get
checked out at the infirmary.

144
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,480
That's nonsense.

145
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,316
Me strong like bull.

146
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,377
Let's go on a quest.

147
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,286
You two go talk
to Alice's whatever.

148
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,259
Eliot, honey, maybe you and I
should go upstairs and rest.

149
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,618
Wait, wait, wait.

150
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,598
Are my eyes open
or closed right now?

151
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,735
How about now?

152
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,471
Shit.

153
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,846
Shit.

154
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,147
Uh, coming!

155
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,251
Don't worry.
It's only me.

156
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,652
I was just checking
the Free Trader app

157
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,721
to see if you'd imploded.

158
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,022
I kept that offline.

159
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,860
Uh, so...
what do I call you?

160
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:24,330
Like, Richard or Failstaff or...

161
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,900
Richard,
though some of the others

162
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,368
might prefer
their log-in names.

163
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,197
Hey, when was the last time
you unplugged?

164
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,338
- It's been a while.
- Oh.

165
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,008
But, I mean,
when was the last time

166
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,907
I had actual friends to discuss
"Godel, Escher, Bach" with?

167
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,249
But listen. The portals
are gonna take me a couple hours

168
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,347
to calculate if you want to,
you know, straighten up.

169
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,050
Thank God.

170
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,592
Listen, do you mind
if we commandeer the guest room

171
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,087
for the project?

172
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,018
Um, what project?

173
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,857
Aha.

174
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,388
Ah, you and Asmodeus will learn
more once you've leveled up.

175
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,855
The next 12 spells.

176
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,431
No mistakes.

177
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,899
Wow.

178
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,468
"The," um...

179
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,199
"The Spellbinder"?

180
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,705
I mean, it was right there.

181
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,408
Mm.

182
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,579
Yeah, because it's
a binder filled with spells.

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,427
Hi.

184
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,763
You must be Vicious Circe.

185
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,766
I'm Silver.

186
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,501
- Hi.
- Bender.

187
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,235
Thanks for having me.

188
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,940
I'm extremely happy finally
to meet you face-to-face.

189
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,842
I've taken the liberty of
writing a cooperative variation

190
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,344
on the spell
I sent you last week.

191
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,977
Menolly.
Finally, in person.

192
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,023
How you feeling?

193
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,978
So good.

194
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,646
I am danked
as shit right now, girl.

195
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,756
The perks of chemo
just keep rolling in.

196
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,826
Hi.

197
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,187
Asmodeus is the last one.

198
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,356
She's actually just
coming from uptown,

199
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,165
but rush hour, you know.

200
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,135
- Hi.
- Asmodeus.

201
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,641
Welcome.

202
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,682
You two know each other.

203
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:28,017
Obviously I didn't realize
that you two had history,

204
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,951
and I don't want to dismiss it,

205
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,486
but we are running
out of time here,

206
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,791
and we need both of you.

207
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,725
Okay?

208
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,297
Of course.

209
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,331
I've never been
to Chicago before.

210
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,896
This isn't Chicago;
it's the 'burbs.

211
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,295
We should make this fast.

212
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,836
Maybe you can wait outside
while I run in.

213
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,209
Come on, Vix,
when are you gonna tell me

214
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,209
who we're here to see?

215
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,479
What's the big secret?

216
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,238
Just let me do the talking.

217
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,928
Jesus, it's like
the TARDIS in here.

218
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,659
What kind of magic
are these people using?

219
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,732
Thibadeau's Planar Compression.

220
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,103
It's really not a big deal.

221
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:16,769
Alice, who's house
is this, exactly?

222
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,400
Alice.

223
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,208
Hi, Dad.

224
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,188
So glad you guys could make it
for the Veneralia,

225
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:37,017
the Roman festival of Venus.

226
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,223
Did Alice tell you
I study historical magic?

227
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,386
We celebrate all the Roman
holidays around here.

228
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,357
Jesus Christ,
how come you didn't tell me

229
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,865
we were coming
to see your parents?

230
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,197
Because I knew you'd make
a big deal out of it

231
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,568
and act like this.

232
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,539
Well... I...
so they're travelers?

233
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,768
Amongst other things?

234
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,111
No, my mom just
knows a traveler.

235
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:55,407
Look, it's complicated.
Just... shh.

236
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,076
Let me handle it.

237
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,107
Really hope you can
come back for the Saturnalia.

238
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,148
Much less tame
than this whole thing.

239
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,249
- Right. This is a little tame.
- Hmm.

240
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,881
Dad, I need to talk
to Mom, like, now.

241
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:06,946
It's important.

242
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,821
Well, after a frolic,

243
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,591
she'll usually head
for the tepidarium.

244
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,220
Can you please
just call it the bath?

245
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,625
Nonsense.
This is my domus.

246
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,588
I shall call it what I please.

247
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,826
Ugh.

248
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,066
Okay, look.

249
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,936
Distract my dad.
I'll be 30 minutes, tops.

250
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,337
Please?

251
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,906
So, dating my daughter, eh?

252
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,148
Let's have a little
fatherly chat.

253
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,451
I can't believe
I gave up tickets

254
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,115
to "Hamilton" for this.

255
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,026
Um, sorry you have
to do your job.

256
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,087
Ugh, story of my life.

257
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,025
Anyway, there's nothing
wrong with him.

258
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,931
Really?
Nothing at all?

259
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,102
Well, he has
a massive drug problem,

260
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,371
but at least
he's medicating, hmm?

261
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,838
Ah.

262
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,706
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

263
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,007
You, on the other hand,

264
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,708
appear to require
medical intervention.

265
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,841
What?

266
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,216
That was me?

267
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,021
Yep.

268
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,822
Something's draining
her chi, her life force...

269
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,225
or someone.

270
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,057
So, okay, I know that
this is embarrassing,

271
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,663
but trust me, dying is worse.

272
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,804
Have you engaged
in any unprotected rituals

273
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,068
of any kind?

274
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,339
Be honest.

275
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,468
God.

276
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,673
That son of a bitch.

277
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,508
They're chanting something.

278
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,213
Uh, look.
We should get started.

279
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,345
We have a lot of spells
to get through.

280
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:51,023
You know, first,
I just want to be clear.

281
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,492
Richard might be
about forgiveness,

282
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,193
but I'm sure as shit not.

283
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,330
Look, I'm sorry you and your mom
had a shitty relationship,

284
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,270
but not a day goes by
where I don't feel terrible

285
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:02,899
about what happened to her.

286
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,703
I did not cause her death, okay?

287
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,942
I only wish that
I could've stopped it.

288
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:09,040
I'm just trying to make up
for my past,

289
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,442
just like you.

290
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,910
Did she suffer?

291
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,754
She said she loved you.

292
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,016
Yeah, I know she did.

293
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,460
So are we gonna do this,
or what?

294
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,936
Whoa.

295
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,535
William.

296
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,106
You're late.

297
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,382
I'm what?
Who are you?

298
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,751
You always ask
the same questions.

299
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,492
I don't know
what you're talking about.

300
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,887
You never do.

301
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,619
I'm a member of The Order,

302
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,894
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands,

303
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:02,463
the greatest repository
of knowledge, full stop.

304
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,134
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are

305
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,902
that are trying to kill me?

306
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:10,771
The locals used to work for us
in a custodial function,

307
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:14,070
but labor relations
have become somewhat...

308
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,774
strained of late.

309
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,675
We had to ban them
from the libraries.

310
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,737
They've been thoroughly cursed,
so they can't use the fountains,

311
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,406
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment,

312
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,015
some with a particularly
nasty entity.

313
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,649
The Beast?

314
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,354
Well, he has many names.

315
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,416
Look, this is all great,

316
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,631
but I'm just trying to get back
to the Earth fountain.

317
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:35,857
Can you show me where it is?

318
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,496
I suppose
I could order you a map,

319
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,157
but it'd have to come
from another branch.

320
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,665
Great, let's do that.

321
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,127
Interlibrary loans
typically take

322
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,795
two to four weeks to process.

323
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,003
Are you kidding?
That's two years on my world.

324
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,536
Then I'm afraid we are limited

325
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,141
to the resources of this branch.

326
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,509
Follow me.

327
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,850
Alice?

328
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,388
Hi, Mom.

329
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,129
Alice.

330
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,330
Fine.

331
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,832
Stephanie.

332
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,003
You know how
I feel about "Mom."

333
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:18,902
I just... I have an important
question to ask you.

334
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,905
Sure.

335
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,237
Push past everything
you left on the table

336
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,711
the last time we spoke.

337
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,682
I'm sure you've forgotten
all about it.

338
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,210
Oh, my God.

339
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,975
You're really not gonna
let that go, are you?

340
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,086
Because we haven't
finished discussing it.

341
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,747
It was six months ago.

342
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,427
Look, I just...

343
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,358
Mom... Stephanie,

344
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,002
I don't see the point
in talking about it.

345
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:47,829
We don't agree on it,
and we're never going to.

346
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,234
Well, because you act like
there's something wrong with me.

347
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,996
No, I just think
it's weird that you...

348
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:55,165
you're not at all curious
about what happened to Charlie.

349
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:59,213
It's not gonna bring him back,
so I don't want to know...

350
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,782
Which is a perfectly
reasonable position

351
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,018
in spite of how you judge me.

352
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,687
Fine.
Okay, fine.

353
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,058
Okay, I don't need
that patronizing tone.

354
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,457
Then what do you want from me?

355
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:16,289
How about...
hmm...

356
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,626
you admit that your mother
is a human being,

357
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,572
because you act
like you're the only one

358
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:24,798
who has a right to feel.

359
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,904
No, I don't.

360
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,806
I just...

361
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,738
Okay.

362
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,812
I think we're done talking.

363
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,449
This conversation
has worn me out entirely.

364
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,119
Excuse me.

365
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,677
I just feel like I'm being
pulled back into this version

366
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,177
of me when I was, like,
12 and furious

367
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,609
and invisible and mute.

368
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,745
Ugh, she just fucking
does that to me.

369
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,450
Well, I'm sure being cooped up
in your old room helps.

370
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,321
It's like going back
in time to 2004.

371
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,160
The "Garden State" soundtrack.

372
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:19,918
Hey, that was cool
when it came out.

373
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,959
"The Joy of Sex"?

374
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,632
Is that, uh, Stephanie?

375
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,867
My dad.

376
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,498
He meant well.

377
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,441
But my mom made him give me
the version from the '70s

378
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:33,838
because she thinks
that kids should know

379
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,140
what pubic hair looks like.

380
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,941
Jesus Christ.

381
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,812
I can't imagine what you must
be thinking of me right now.

382
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,281
It's cool.

383
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:46,552
I'm, like, really
into damaged chicks.

384
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,621
Like Julia?

385
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,462
Alice, I don't know what
you think Julia and I were,

386
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:55,357
but the truth is
that we weren't anything.

387
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,499
We were two kids
who tested well,

388
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,357
got placed together,
and I got a crush

389
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,725
because that's
how hormones work,

390
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,403
and she didn't,
and I got over it,

391
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,842
and the end.

392
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,408
I'm kind of new
to this whole thing,

393
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,178
if you hadn't guessed.

394
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,909
All my past relationships were,
like, you know, at a party.

395
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,916
"Can we just do this
standing up?" kind of thing.

396
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,750
Well, the fact
that you could want

397
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,355
to have sex with anyone

398
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,357
after living in this house
is pretty impressive.

399
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,660
Thanks.

400
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,002
So what's the deal
with this traveler?

401
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,239
Why can't we just ask?

402
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,540
I mean...

403
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,371
Okay, so...

404
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,508
My mom knows this traveler
from another world, Joe.

405
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,048
- Joe?
- Yeah.

406
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,949
Apparently his actual name
is impossible to pronounce.

407
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,251
Anyway, it's kind of
a touchy subject,

408
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,624
and I think that it's best
that when I talk to my mom,

409
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,892
my dad's not around.

410
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,890
Why?
Is she sleeping with Joe?

411
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,962
And your dad doesn't know?

412
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:08,567
Alice, they were having
a sex party when we showed up.

413
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,368
Look, I know
it sounds ridiculous,

414
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,870
but my parents
are weird and possessive,

415
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,243
and they just have
to do everything together.

416
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,040
Look, when I was ten,

417
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,806
my dad caught my mom
having an affair,

418
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,754
and he threatened
to commit suicide.

419
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,453
Oh, my God.

420
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,594
He said he had to go extreme
just to get her attention,

421
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,958
which... he was psychotic,

422
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,259
but he wasn't wrong.

423
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,827
I think he would have done it
if she hadn't come around.

424
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,299
Well...

425
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,974
Now I kind of feel like
a dick for making fun

426
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,836
of your "Garden State"
soundtrack.

427
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,148
Total dick.

428
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,949
Now you have to help me.

429
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,327
I think that was
one of your memories.

430
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,467
Yeah.

431
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,768
- Antarctica.
- Jesus.

432
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,870
What brought you there?

433
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,441
Brakebills.

434
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,142
So what happened?

435
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,777
I mean, why'd you leave?

436
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,178
They found out my deal,

437
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,616
and it was either stay
and get brain-wiped

438
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,777
or jet.

439
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,446
I was heading to New York.

440
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,685
I was coming to kill Marina.

441
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,326
Well, then what happened?

442
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,957
I met Richard,

443
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:47,899
and he convinced me
Marina could wait

444
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,800
and invited me to join
the Free Trader Beowulf,

445
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:55,207
which sounded...
I don't know...

446
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,738
maybe better than death
or jail, so...

447
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,815
Uh, everything okay in there?

448
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,477
Yeah, great. All good.

449
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,486
I know a hundred ways
to break in.

450
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,848
We have four spells left.

451
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,256
Let's just finish, okay?

452
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,917
Then they have to let us in
on their project.

453
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,056
Just a little further.

454
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,770
Wait a minute.
I... I know these people.

455
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,440
Well, every book is here...

456
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,839
all the books ever written,
all the books never written,

457
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,741
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

458
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,378
This is my book.

459
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,179
Yo.

460
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,721
Why are there all these flowers
and shit on the cover?

461
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,686
People who read
their books often discover

462
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:44,256
they don't like
the main character

463
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,857
and are rarely happy
with how it ends.

464
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:57,026
Ah.
Here it is.

465
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,436
Wait, Martin?
That's...

466
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,069
That's one of the Fillory kids.

467
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,043
Okay, is there anything
in there about The Beast?

468
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,042
I'm sorry.
I can't lend you this.

469
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,044
Not without a library card.

470
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,481
Course you can't.

471
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,722
You know, shit like this is
why people hate librarians.

472
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,389
What are you doing?

473
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,129
Here's what would happen
if we did what you're thinking:

474
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,557
you'd try to steal
this book by force,

475
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,397
we'd fight, you'd lose,

476
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:26,928
but you'd rip out several pages

477
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:31,470
before I banished you
from the library.

478
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,771
This way, no books get hurt.

479
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,356
Ff...

480
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,087
I hate this place.

481
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,099
Oh, here.
You have to try this.

482
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Mmm.

483
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,099
- Filleted goat penis.
- Mmm.

484
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,335
Promotes virility. Hmm?

485
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,308
That's very thoughtful
of you, Dad.

486
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,309
Oh.

487
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:19,017
So, Daniel, you were saying
that your discipline

488
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,378
is in historical magic.

489
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,646
Indeed. Ah.

490
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,022
The Romans still fascinate me.

491
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,023
In fact, I'm about
to publish my third volume

492
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,725
on illusion work
of the Collis Aventinus.

493
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,358
Oh, could I see it?

494
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,030
Well, it's still in galleys,

495
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,331
but I suppose
I could show you...

496
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,870
Oh, great.
Uh, that sounds great.

497
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,397
Could we... which...
let's go now.

498
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,069
But you haven't even
touched your penis.

499
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,670
You know what?
I had a ton of it yesterday.

500
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:40,842
You said that it was this way.

501
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,910
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, well...

502
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,178
Stephanie...

503
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
I was wrong, and you were right,

504
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,682
and I promise to be a better
daughter in the future.

505
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,316
Right about what?

506
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:59,222
I couldn't possibly know
how you feel

507
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,555
other than that you feel deeply,

508
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,991
and you are your own person,

509
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,696
and you're the only one

510
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,568
who knows how to deal
with your stuff,

511
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,397
and it was wrong
of me to presume.

512
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,567
Was that really
so tough, sweetie?

513
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:19,208
Look, I know this
is a tricky subject,

514
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,681
but my friend's life
is in danger,

515
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:22,880
and I need to talk
to you about Joe.

516
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:24,382
Joe.
Oh!

517
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,083
I love Joe!

518
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,890
Would you hand me
that minced parrot, please?

519
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,419
Wait.
I don't understand.

520
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,999
I thought you wouldn't
want Dad to hear.

521
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,259
Why on earth not?

522
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,561
Because it could
destroy your marriage.

523
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,732
What?
Your father loves Joe.

524
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,033
I don't understand.

525
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,304
I thought you were
hiding him from him.

526
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,569
Nope.

527
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,870
Alice, you make me
sound so melodramatic.

528
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,708
Fine, yes, sure.

529
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,877
At first, yeah,

530
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,778
your father
was a touch sensitive,

531
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,910
but then he figured out

532
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,776
that Joe could work
for both of us,

533
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,819
so now he's our third,

534
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,257
you know, in a sort of
polyamorous-triad sense.

535
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,988
- So you and Joe and...
- Yeah.

536
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,995
Joe's anatomy is adaptable.

537
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,597
He's like a Swiss Army knife.

538
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,728
He's good for every occasion.

539
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,403
So whatever do you
want with Joe?

540
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,773
- I need his help.
- Oh, sweetie.

541
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,009
I'm sure Quentin
will understand.

542
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,787
You see two of you too, right?

543
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,659
Okay, good.

544
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,360
This stuff is finally
starting to wear off.

545
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,460
Margo.

546
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,665
Uh, I can explain.

547
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,336
Explain this, you dick!

548
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,872
Hi.

549
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,608
I'm Eliot.

550
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,507
So what's up?
How can I help?

551
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,313
Please know I'm
a certified therapist at home

552
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,814
as well as here.

553
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,046
You can trust me completely.

554
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,651
No, no, no.

555
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,322
Like I said, our friend
is trapped in the Neitherlands.

556
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:11,861
- Uh, acquaintance.
- That place is the worst.

557
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:13,717
So confusing.

558
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:16,156
Not to mention those fountains.
Completely unpredictable.

559
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,232
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

560
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,366
Could you, like, draw us a map?

561
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,127
Yeah, I guess.

562
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,495
Of what I know.

563
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,973
It's not gonna do
your friend any good

564
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:28,471
if he's very far
from the Earth fountain,

565
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,744
although I might have something
that could help with that.

566
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:32,711
Great.
What?

567
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,242
It's a beacon.

568
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,876
You cast it here,
and the fountain

569
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,581
for this world lights up there.

570
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,383
Okay, so how do we cast it?

571
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,745
Well, there are some
specific requirements...

572
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,315
sexually speaking.

573
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:49,728
Wait.
It's sex magic?

574
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,729
All magic where I'm from
is sex magic.

575
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,000
Thought you knew that.

576
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,401
I could perform it with you
if you'd prefer.

577
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,004
I'm a heck of a pinch hitter.

578
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,205
Think we've got this.

579
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,838
All right.
Suit yourself.

580
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,883
I sense a nice connection
between your genitals.

581
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:07,278
You should be fine.

582
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,579
You just need some blood,

583
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,049
a globe,

584
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,920
a few candles bound with twine.

585
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:17,588
Oh, and you both have
to climax at the same time.

586
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,518
That gonna be a problem?

587
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,926
- No.
- Well...

588
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,228
What?

589
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,699
I'm sorry.

590
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,200
We need the spell to work,
right?

591
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,883
I can't believe
I'm letting your boyfriend

592
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:42,979
talk to my boyfriend
about how to...

593
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,112
ugh.

594
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,416
I've never been prouder,

595
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,318
although I must say

596
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,990
this one seems like
an awful lot of work.

597
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,791
Who? Quentin?

598
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,226
You're complicated.

599
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,057
You need somebody
who gets that about you.

600
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,731
Maybe several people.

601
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,134
Don't take this
the wrong way, Mom,

602
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,135
but shut the fuck up, okay?

603
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,666
We'll talk
when you're less cranky.

604
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:22,287
Cheers.

605
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,759
Darling.

606
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,261
Are you okay?

607
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,529
No.

608
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,999
I'm not okay, you dick.

609
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,698
- You stole my life force.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

610
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,536
Uh, there was a tiny hole
in the casting.

611
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,667
I've corrected it.
Won't happen again.

612
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,443
Shouldn't have happened at all.

613
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,509
I begged you to stay.

614
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,810
Margo, I... I needed you.

615
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:47,981
You broke my heart.

616
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:49,280
The only way I could repair it

617
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:53,017
was to create my golem of you.

618
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,887
A golem of Margo.

619
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,489
A Margolem.

620
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,290
You selfish prick.

621
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,861
You put my life at risk

622
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,532
so you could have
a realistic-looking sex doll?

623
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,531
No, no, no.
I...

624
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,033
I wanted a relationship.

625
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,002
Margo...

626
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,637
I love you.

627
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,908
And sometimes the only thing
that we do is spoon and...

628
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,576
You're gross.

629
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,177
I'm taking the Margolem,
and I'm going to destroy it,

630
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,880
and I hope no one ever
spoons you again.

631
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:30,889
What?

632
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,418
What are you doing?

633
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,586
Nothing.

634
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,525
I brought you to support me
while I fight with my ex,

635
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,101
not do lines with the golem.

636
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, I'm sorry.

637
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,698
I thought this is how
we support each other.

638
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:47,103
Is there something
you want to say to me, Eliot?

639
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,774
No.

640
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,705
What is there to say?

641
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,910
I like your golem.

642
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:57,753
Life is a unicorn
shitting rainbows of candy.

643
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,416
I'll, um...

644
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,790
I'll deal with
the Margolem myself.

645
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,591
Just go home, Eliot.

646
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,203
You have the most
beautiful hair.

647
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,606
And your eyes are, like,

648
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,537
the perfect shade of blue.

649
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,644
And you're also smart.

650
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,275
Okay, okay.

651
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,550
It kind of feels like you're
trying to do a thing here.

652
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,549
I...

653
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:36,487
I was told that women like it
when you compliment them.

654
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,890
Yeah, but it has
to feel real, you know?

655
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,958
Since when is that an issue?

656
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,264
What is that supposed to mean?

657
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,495
Nothing.

658
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:53,638
Apparently you can't,
you know, with me.

659
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,239
Not that you'd ever
said that to my face.

660
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,810
Yeah, well, maybe you
should pay better attention

661
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,079
when we're having sex.

662
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,007
I thought I was.
I don't...

663
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,512
think that I've ever paid
that much attention

664
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,481
to anything in my life,

665
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,482
and little did I know that you
were so incredibly convincing.

666
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,124
But isn't that what
you want, Quentin, huh?

667
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,289
To feel like you're perfect
at it every time?

668
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,148
No, not if I'm not.
I want...

669
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,816
How am I supposed to get better

670
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,255
if you won't tell me
if I'm doing it wrong?

671
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,365
So have you, like,

672
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,198
ever come when we're together?

673
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,203
Yes.

674
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,935
Lots of times.

675
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,841
I mean it.

676
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,211
It's just sometimes...

677
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:36,647
sometimes it's not that easy,

678
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,218
you know,
like when we were foxes.

679
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:41,347
Well, I'm sorry I'm not a fox.

680
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,360
Well, there goes the mood.

681
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,909
Voilà.

682
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,982
Reverse entropy.

683
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:14,419
Spell number 12, done and done.

684
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,520
Hard to believe something
so kludgy even works.

685
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,092
Perfect timing. Pizza.

686
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,532
A large half veggie, half meat.

687
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,435
Thank you.

688
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:40,775
Kady.

689
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,046
Do you see that?

690
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,722
Okay, what just happened?

691
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,528
Déjà vu.

692
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,959
Uh-huh.

693
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,272
A large half veggie, half meat.

694
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,811
Thank you.

695
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,445
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

696
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,751
Could it be the entropy spell?

697
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,252
No.

698
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:25,823
No, this is time magic...
much more power involved.

699
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,292
Well, if we didn't
cast it, who did?

700
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,562
Yeah!

701
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,567
Sit.
Let's talk.

702
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,069
You've leveled up.

703
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:40,638
It's time.

704
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,169
No pun intended.

705
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,643
Not to state the obvious,

706
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,275
but we are pushing
the boundaries

707
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,010
of what is magically possible.

708
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,475
We are working our way up
to the energetic glass ceiling

709
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,084
so we can shatter it.

710
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,416
You say that like it's possible.

711
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,288
It is.

712
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,259
Well, not according
to Brakebills.

713
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,818
No, the glass ceiling is

714
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,426
explode and turn into
a niffin or something.

715
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,658
You can't just keep ramping.

716
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,497
Brakebills was right

717
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,528
if you go by
Brakebills' methods.

718
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,002
We have a whole new methodology.

719
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,370
Yeah, but why?

720
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,701
I mean, what are you
trying to do?

721
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,265
And don't just say
"good things."

722
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,874
You're talking about
massive nuclear power.

723
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,705
You're right.
It's personal. Yeah.

724
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,446
We are the best Magicians
we know.

725
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,347
Silver can literally
fly to the moon.

726
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,720
But Menolly is dying,
and we can't cure her.

727
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:32,290
You know, Bender's trying
to stay off the ledge every day.

728
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,126
His meds have stopped working.

729
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,127
And you?

730
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,797
Eight years ago,
I was a drug addict,

731
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,828
and I left my son

732
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,670
in a hot car.

733
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:49,006
And he was eight months old.

734
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,337
My life was destroyed.

735
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,509
Jesus.

736
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,748
You're doing time magic

737
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,317
to change what you did.

738
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,848
Yeah, but only a fluke
natural-born time witch

739
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,353
could do something like that.

740
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,985
Now, I have done
all the research there is,

741
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:10,191
and one day, I realized
I was looking at it wrong.

742
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,060
We don't have the energy,

743
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,165
but it's not that
we need to generate it,

744
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,367
because somebody already has it.

745
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,999
We just need them,
and they can give us

746
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,335
inexhaustible,
unimaginable power.

747
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,905
That's no one.

748
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,911
That's the Source.

749
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,213
That's the place
it all comes from,

750
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,615
how people used to get shit done

751
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,777
when they needed
a fucking miracle.

752
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,885
- The divine.
- You're trying to...

753
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,716
Summon a god.

754
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,766
Your fave.

755
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:55,869
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,244
Can we really talk, baby?

757
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:09,417
I think Professor Lipson
could have been wrong about me.

758
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:13,291
I think something
might really be broken.

759
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,403
What the fuck?

760
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,273
Oh, Jesus.

761
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,565
There she is.

762
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,906
She has a bad habit
of walking off,

763
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,613
although when she does,

764
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,815
it's nice to be reminded
I have a great ass.

765
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,618
I thought you were
going to destroy her.

766
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:44,751
Oh, I was, but then I thought

767
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,016
I'd keep her around
a little longer.

768
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,585
She might come in handy.

769
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,598
What were you two talking about?

770
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,999
Nothing.

771
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,368
Got these for you, bitch.

772
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,940
Aww.

773
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,471
Thanks, bitch.

774
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,114
We need a chaser.

775
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,050
What did you do?

776
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,053
Hmm?

777
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,474
So I'm a dick.

778
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:41,746
I'm insecure, and I suck,

779
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,547
so if we could just
give this another go,

780
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,348
I'll even... I don't know.

781
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,151
I'll be more fox-like
if that's what you want.

782
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,194
I don't want that.

783
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,890
I don't get it, Alice.

784
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,828
I'm not amazing at magic,

785
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:01,599
and apparently,
I'm pretty patchy at this.

786
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:06,899
Why are you even with me?

787
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,005
Because I like you.

788
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,237
A lot.

789
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,242
And I don't know why.

790
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,443
I just really, really do

791
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:15,905
in the weirdest way.

792
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,884
I don't think we're
supposed to like people

793
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,583
for what they're good at.

794
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,094
I think that's something
we make up to torture ourselves.

795
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:26,188
What about what we're bad at?

796
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:29,791
You... you're not
bad at sex.

797
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,855
Okay, I'm just bad
at asking for what I want.

798
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,533
It's embarrassing.

799
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,868
- It's me, Vix.
- I know.

800
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,138
I know. I know.

801
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,909
And I love you.

802
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,283
And so as far as I'm concerned,

803
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:49,108
you know, let's just do this.

804
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,782
Oh.

805
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,918
Okay.
Me too.

806
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,249
You.

807
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,989
Maybe just kiss me?

808
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,520
No.

809
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,585
There.

810
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:49,306
Bite me.

811
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:06,790
Oh, Quentin, you girly
fanboy piece of shit.

812
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,221
You did it.

813
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,875
Whoa.

814
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,320
Welcome back.
