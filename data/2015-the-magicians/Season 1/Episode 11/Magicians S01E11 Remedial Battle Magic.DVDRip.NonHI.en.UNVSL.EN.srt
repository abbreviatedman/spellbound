1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,526
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,003
<i>Okay, what is this place?</i>

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,664
<i>Brakebills University.</i>

4
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,503
<i>You've been offered
a preliminary exam</i>

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,668
<i>for entry into the
graduate program.</i>

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,939
Regrettably, you
failed the written exam.

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,540
Can I start over?

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,209
There's this voice. Everyone
else comes with a lot of static,

9
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,082
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,087
You were hearing The
Beast? I was getting duped.

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,714
I'm Stanley. I'm your mentor.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,281
Travelers are rare.

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,725
Where are we? The Neitherlands.

14
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,489
The place between
all other places.

15
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,589
My friend's life is in danger, and
I need to talk to you about Joe.

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,102
Joe? Oh! I love Joe.

17
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,296
Wait, so you know your
way around the Neitherlands?

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,737
How can I help?

19
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,003
We are pushing the boundaries
of what is magically possible.

20
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,237
We are the best
Magicians we know.

21
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,577
<i>Silver can literally fly to the
moon but Menolly is dying.</i>

22
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,617
<i>Bender's trying to stay
off a ledge every day.</i>

23
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:50,810
You're trying to...

24
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,045
<i>Summon a god.</i>

25
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,153
I'm a member of the Order,

26
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,281
the keepers of the
libraries of the Neitherlands,

27
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,950
the greatest repository
of knowledge.

28
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,051
Here it is. Wait,
Martin? That's...

29
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,114
Okay, is there anything
in there about The Beast?

30
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,097
Go back to the part where you
literally popped in on them banging.

31
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,572
We were casting a spell.

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,972
No judgment.

33
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,666
Saved your life.

34
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,713
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,124
It sounds like if
we could find it,

36
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,468
we could use it
to kill The Beast.

37
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,619
El! Jesus!

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,513
It's 11:00 in the morning.

39
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,950
I'm listening.

40
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,221
So, Martin's desperate
'cause the Plover

41
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,921
figured out a way
to change physically,

42
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,464
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

43
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,968
which meant that, pretty soon, he'd
be able to follow Martin into Fillory.

44
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:48,167
Yeah, so Martin got a line on
an enchanted knife, the Leo.

45
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,241
Uh...

46
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,343
Yeah, "powerful enough to tear
through the fabric of magic itself."

47
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,608
Like kill a God,

48
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:59,346
so qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

49
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,164
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

50
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,588
Fucking love that guy.

51
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,522
Yeah, so Martin tracked
down the knife maker,

52
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,618
asked him if he could make
him one, and the guy said,

53
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,626
uh...

54
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,454
"Yeah, I can."

55
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,699
And then what?

56
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,097
Uh, well, that's the
end of the pages.

57
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,194
Yeah, nothing happened.

58
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,345
If Martin killed The Beast, would
we be here now talking about him?

59
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,400
Yeah, but here's the thing.

60
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,778
"So, little did Martin know, he
would fail to recover the blade,

61
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,476
"which would remain
hidden for decades,"

62
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,042
which means it could still be
sitting somewhere waiting for us.

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,354
Right, in Fillory, the
place where The Beast is.

64
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,595
Ergo, fuck that.

65
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,723
Hey.

66
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,595
Here's a crazy idea.

67
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,898
Plover wants the button back.
Why don't we just give it to him?

68
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,097
I don't think that's
a very good plan.

69
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,348
That's a monumentally
shitty plan.

70
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,431
I don't know.

71
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,202
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

72
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,007
So, what if we hand
them the button,

73
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,556
thereby giving The
Beast what he wants,

74
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,412
thereby rendering
ourselves harmless,

75
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,745
thereby he leaves us alone.

76
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,596
Right 'cause handing the key to the
multiverse to a monster is a really...

77
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,849
That's a good idea, Eliot.

78
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,787
Beats getting vivisected.
Speak for yourself.

79
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,435
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel

80
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,059
to Fillory so he
keeps it all to himself,

81
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,289
I'm still a problem.

82
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,197
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

83
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,633
The rest of us do
not have that luxury,

84
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,797
so let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea out of bed.

85
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,895
Okay, stop.

86
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:32,546
This affects all of us, so
those in favor of striking a deal...

87
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,287
Sorry. It's the right move.

88
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,293
Because you still seem, I
don't know, gloomy about it.

89
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,407
I can't believe you're not.
Penny's been gone for a week.

90
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,400
Which is like an hour in
the Neitherlands, right?

91
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,198
It means nothing.
What if it works?

92
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,405
Then it works. The Beast
leaves us alone. Great.

93
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,033
You're just upset 'cause you
may never get to go to Fillory.

94
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,702
No, that would be stupid.

95
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,441
Quentin. Why would I want to go?

96
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,991
The child-molesting demon, who
incidentally wrote my favorite books,

97
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,483
is there waiting to kill us.

98
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,779
Come on. We're late for PA.

99
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,990
Oh, my God.

100
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,968
No!

101
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,571
Please, wake up!

102
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,178
Margo, how did this happen?

103
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,252
We should have
listened to you, Q.

104
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,711
You think you're
hiding, don't you?

105
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,510
Sleep tight, Quentin Coldwater.

106
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,412
No way in hell we're doing
that fucking spell again.

107
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,145
You okay? Oh, my God.

108
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,650
Yeah, I'm just a little shaky.

109
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,212
I don't like dying.

110
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,514
No kidding.

111
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,053
You are Margo. You are fabulous.

112
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,919
You are under the influence
of a probability spell.

113
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,497
I am fabulous, aren't I?

114
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,793
Yeah.

115
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,757
What happened to you?

116
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,161
Beast ripped my head
off in the Neitherlands.

117
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,138
So much for
negotiating my freedom.

118
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,035
All right, this was a dead end.

119
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,906
Well, I hate to say I told
you so, but you know what?

120
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,971
Actually, I don't. I
don't. I don't hate that.

121
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,680
This is the last one. It's dead.

122
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,819
We're not learning anything new.

123
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,449
In every scenario, The
Beast comes next week.

124
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,155
There was one time we didn't
all die. When we went to Fillory.

125
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,166
No. Everything went white.
It's not necessarily better...

126
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,565
Well, I agree with Quentin.

127
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,434
That's because he blows you.

128
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,964
Seriously, eight tries. We get
seven deaths, one mysterious. I...

129
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,136
Give me that. I don't
think that we have a choice.

130
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,305
No, I'm choosing to get
the fuck away from all of you.

131
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,916
<i>Hello, old friend. Been a while.</i>

132
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,924
<i>Do say you missed me a little.</i>

133
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,457
Fuck you.

134
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,903
<i>Let me cut to the chase.
You will deliver yourself to me.</i>

135
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,405
<i>Do it now, or do it when you've
gone so mad you have nothing left</i>

136
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,038
<i>because I'm going to
make it very, very loud.</i>

137
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,750
Here's the deal. People used
to petition gods all the time

138
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,449
to bestow power, to work
stuff that we'd never dream of.

139
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,788
Now, they're it.
Biggest source there is.

140
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,761
At least, they were,
question being...

141
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,162
Where the hell are they now?

142
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,325
Exactly. No one's
spoken to a god

143
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,732
in centuries. They disappeared.

144
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,072
I believe that we can find
a way to contact them again

145
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,109
to get the kind of
help they used to give.

146
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,575
It's time, Richard.

147
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,011
Contact how?

148
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,779
Humans aren't
their only children.

149
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,617
There are others who are
older and might know more.

150
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,750
Magical creatures.

151
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,655
You mean like
vampires and unicorns?

152
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,424
I think unicorns
are a myth, but yes.

153
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,229
Find something high up
enough in the hierarchy,

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,495
they might actually remember

155
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,799
when gods and humans
were on speaking terms.

156
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,391
And there's a huge cross-section
of them right here in the city.

157
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,407
Yeah, because
they want to use us.

158
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,568
Look, you're right.

159
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,080
Most of them know nothing other
than hunger, thirst, and how to hide,

160
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,946
but it's a food chain.
We start at the bottom.

161
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,180
We work our way up till we find
someone who can help us get to them.

162
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,261
How long have you been at this?

163
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,884
A while.

164
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,994
I won't lie. You know,
it's been tough going.

165
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,691
Bender, show them.

166
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,825
Mostly bloodsuckers,
useless junkies,

167
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,566
but sometimes you can get
a lead onto something else.

168
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,541
After they talk your ear
off for, like, 12 hours.

169
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,103
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

170
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,776
but I think we have an
ace up our sleeve now.

171
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,552
Julia.

172
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,786
What?

173
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,350
That prayer I gave you, you
know, doesn't work for everyone.

174
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,954
Actually, you're the first.

175
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,420
I don't understand...

176
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,540
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

177
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,998
but I gave you a test.

178
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,726
Why?

179
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,934
I'm not religious.
I'm not anything.

180
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,173
We don't know why some
people are god-touched.

181
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,711
There's no rhyme or reason.

182
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,109
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

183
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,542
But it's you, Julia.

184
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,086
I think if we send you on the
hunt, we're gonna get some results.

185
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,021
I don't know. Penny
was pretty clear.

186
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,160
What are we planning?

187
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,001
Nothing yet. Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

188
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,710
before we even set
foot in Fillory because

189
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,071
the Neitherlands are
full of mercenaries.

190
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,507
Sounds like a problem.

191
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,669
Point is, we need some
serious battle magic.

192
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,871
But that stuff's illegal.

193
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,010
I'm fucking with you. I'm in.

194
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,851
I'm in, too. I heard
the word "illegal."

195
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:58,992
Oh, Alice, there's a note for you
from admin. I see you've got a call.

196
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,630
Mom, please, just calm
down. I can't understand you.

197
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,726
You what?

198
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,630
I'm so sorry.

199
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,700
I have to go. I'll call
you as soon as I can.

200
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,369
It's Joe.

201
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,042
He killed himself.

202
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,808
What?

203
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,080
I have to talk to Penny.

204
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,993
My mom says he was hearing
voices, and it was getting worse,

205
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,994
and that the voices
were threatening him.

206
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,106
He's a Traveler. He was a
Traveler, and I just thought...

207
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,634
I know what
happened to her friend.

208
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,404
It's The Beast. Shit.

209
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,481
I got it under control.

210
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,827
Penny, maybe you
should think about

211
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,683
the possibility that
he's targeting you guys.

212
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,298
I mean, you're like
a walking button...

213
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,762
Think you're telling
me anything new?

214
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,255
Sorry. I should go. I...

215
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,856
Penny, where are you gonna go?

216
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,644
We can find a way to help you.

217
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,296
I'm sorry. I've got
to talk to someone.

218
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,772
Stanley, man, you there?

219
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,710
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

220
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,924
You been hearing him, too?

221
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,155
He knows everything
there is about me.

222
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:41,388
My son's home address, describes
my granddaughter's every freckle.

223
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,123
Look, man, he's targeting us

224
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,462
because we can hear
him, because we can travel.

225
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,798
I mean, he wants all the roads
in and out of his fortress on lock.

226
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,064
No shit.

227
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,636
Like I want to
travel to a blue state.

228
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,667
Never mind other worlds.

229
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,371
What do we do?

230
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,677
I got a plan, and there's
nothing he can do to stop me.

231
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,715
Yeah? What's the plan?

232
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,623
Watch and trust me.

233
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,892
This removes all his leverage.

234
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,857
He can't make me
do a damn thing.

235
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,205
Where did you get this? Is
this, like, from World War II?

236
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,471
I tripped and fell on it locked in
a drawer in Sunderland's office.

237
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,977
My Japanese is a little
rusty, but I think that this says

238
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,239
Magic <i>Misairu</i>

239
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,111
Magic missile?

240
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,185
That's like straight-up
<i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i> Oh. Okay.

241
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,289
Uh...

242
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,483
Do you want to... Okay. Move.

243
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,875
Your Popper 43 is off.

244
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,583
Huh?

245
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,880
- What if we got guns?
- What?

246
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,948
No! No, look, this is
basic Prime Directive.

247
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,292
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society. You can't...

248
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,459
Yes, very pristine. It's been taken
over by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

249
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,434
Yeah, and that's
not Fillory's fault.

250
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,902
Great. Let's go native.

251
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,135
Scale of one to 10, how are
you with a broadsword, Quentin?

252
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,403
This should've worked.

253
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,676
Could of, should of, would of.

254
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,236
I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

255
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,372
One time or another.

256
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,815
Eliot, you...

257
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,249
Twisted Mike's neck like a doll?

258
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,184
Yeah, and it was
shockingly easy.

259
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,721
I don't have an
explainer for you.

260
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,115
Yeah, and it just sort
of came puking out.

261
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,350
Well, where did you learn it?

262
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,994
I know who we need to talk to.

263
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:02,299
<i>Tonight, Penny, or I kill
the girl in the dungeon.</i>

264
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,739
Quentin.

265
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,606
No. Whatever it is, just no.

266
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,005
Look, we need your help.

267
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,983
We're trying to locate your ex.

268
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,355
Penny, please. I know, but
this is really that important.

269
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,246
It feels jacked to be doing a
mirror spell in here, seriously.

270
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,262
Just focus. It's not working!

271
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,137
Because she's a good Magician,
and she doesn't want to be found.

272
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,021
Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but...

273
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,536
The reflection's changing.

274
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,058
You're welcome.

275
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,156
Penny!

276
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,362
Come with us!

277
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,103
I know this place.

278
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,800
That's Julia's apartment.

279
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,309
Shit.

280
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,175
Okay.

281
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,413
Hi.

282
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,649
Could we come in?

283
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,431
Julia's not here. She won't
be back for a couple hours.

284
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,729
Yeah, we're here to
talk to you, actually.

285
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,731
Okay. Um...

286
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,500
<i>Please! Please give
him what he wants!</i>

287
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,280
I think that's an
insanely stupid idea.

288
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,592
You don't just go fight
someone stronger on his turf.

289
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,527
We know. We have
a plan for The Beast.

290
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,007
We just need to make
sure we have enough

291
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,897
under our belt to
even make it to him.

292
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,265
Let's just say
you're very likely

293
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,894
to be mugged in
the Neitherlands.

294
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,830
I'm sorry. I can't
teach it to you.

295
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,835
Look, most people can't do
battle magic, except in crazy spurts.

296
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,810
Like "baby trapped
under a car" type shit.

297
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,509
But you can do it on cue.

298
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,313
Yeah, 'cause I
studied it for years.

299
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,951
Give us the CliffsNotes.

300
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,650
Fine. Meditate every
day for, like, a decade.

301
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,387
And spells only work if
you channel 100% clean.

302
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,989
Great. So we're stuck
with our dicks in our hands.

303
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:51,036
Look, there is this
thing Hedges use,

304
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,335
but I really wouldn't
recommend it.

305
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,505
Okay. Now we're listening.

306
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,985
<i>She bleeds so
easily, poor little thing.</i>

307
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,316
Fuck!

308
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,553
<i>I barely touched her.</i>

309
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Hey.

310
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,434
Look...

311
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,400
So...

312
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,345
How is she? Julia, I mean.

313
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,313
Why do you care after
what she did to you?

314
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,188
Okay. It's none
of your business.

315
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,054
You know, that's
not how it works.

316
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,903
Giving a shit about someone
that you give a shit about

317
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,967
doesn't just evaporate the
second that they fuck up.

318
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,409
So why don't you just admit that

319
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,924
you want to ask me about Penny?

320
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,107
Okay, fine. Look, Julia is good.

321
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,271
Great, actually.

322
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,872
We're working on something that
could help a lot of people, so it's good.

323
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,742
Okay, now you.

324
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,112
Is he okay?

325
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,747
Yeah, he's extra broody, but...

326
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,552
You know, it's
Penny. He's fireproof.

327
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,028
He's like cockroaches. He'll
survive the nuclear winter.

328
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,248
<i>You can end it.</i>

329
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,581
Shut up.

330
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,848
<i>Just end it.</i>

331
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:53,086
Shut up. Oh, shut the hell up!

332
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,525
Stop it. GIRL: <i>Please help me!</i>

333
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,197
<i>Please help me!</i>

334
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,447
You should thank Alice
Quinn. She found you.

335
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,621
Get on with the lecture.

336
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,348
I've overdosed once.

337
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,750
No, twice,

338
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,057
if you count the time I
took so much Prozac,

339
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,029
I developed tardive dyskinesia.

340
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,089
But that was an accident.

341
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,262
The crack, that was a
straight OD, no chaser.

342
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,403
You smoked crack?

343
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,607
I've done things that would
make you hide under a blankie.

344
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,668
So just tell me
what's happening.

345
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,115
A voice from another world
has a thing for Travelers.

346
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,810
So it's an assault.

347
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,819
It's a nice mild term for it.

348
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,459
This goes on the
base of your neck.

349
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,862
It blocks the flow to
your head like a dam.

350
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,266
You didn't think of
giving this to me sooner?

351
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,861
It's not approved.

352
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:17,041
It wears down the mind's
own ability to defend itself.

353
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,012
It's just a temporary fix until we
can put you on a stricter regimen.

354
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,479
I don't have time for this.

355
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:28,385
Penny, you will
never have a home.

356
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,784
You will never
have a real family.

357
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,594
Your gifts will take this
from you, over and over.

358
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,828
So when someone cares
enough to reach out a hand,

359
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,037
just drop the bullshit attitude

360
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,199
and take what they're
offering while you can.

361
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,472
Bottling our
emotions, literally.

362
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,248
Kady says we shouldn't use these

363
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,594
for more than three
hours at a time, right?

364
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,951
That it's too hard
on the system,

365
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,754
and when the feelings come
back, it's extremely intense.

366
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,555
Yeah, yeah. Don't
lean on the bottle.

367
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,425
But, meanwhile, we get to
go full Spock with battle magic.

368
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,620
I don't like it.

369
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,529
Um, it's the perfect cheat.

370
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,919
I didn't say I wasn't gonna
do it. I said I didn't like it.

371
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:20,998
You look...

372
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,193
Damn handsome for someone
who just had a heart attack?

373
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,911
What can I say?
Genetically blessed.

374
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,380
What are those?

375
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,382
What do you care? I thought
you wanted nothing to do with us.

376
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,917
I changed my mind.

377
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,483
I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.

378
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,083
That girl you saw
in the dungeon?

379
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,960
Yeah, we'll get her out.

380
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,264
Deal.

381
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:54,173
This somehow doesn't feel like a
place where anyone knows anything.

382
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,707
Apparently this
guy's old as dirt.

383
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,105
Got to start
somewhere. Who knows?

384
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:09,377
<i>'Cause you can't hold
back What you can't attract</i>

385
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:12,391
<i>The subtle attention of time</i>

386
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,087
<i>If you see her, just let me know</i>

387
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,061
<i>I plan to make this woman mine</i>

388
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,324
Girls.

389
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,128
Agency sent you?

390
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,192
You Bjorn?

391
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,070
I asked for blondes.

392
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,501
I heard about you
from a girl who got fired

393
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,304
from the blood bank on
67th about a year ago.

394
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,208
Apparently, she wasn't
stealing for herself.

395
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,970
Tracy sold me out?

396
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,481
What did you give her?

397
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,176
Honestly, 20 bucks,

398
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,247
so I don't think
that was true love.

399
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,848
What do you want? I'm busy.

400
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,980
Look, we just have
a few questions.

401
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,453
We'll pay.

402
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,196
Twenty whole
dollars, rich bitch?

403
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,601
Whose is it?

404
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,268
Mine, so it's the cleanest
thing in this room.

405
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,069
We want to petition a god.

406
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:15,212
A god? You mean like a god?

407
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:21,055
Nobody's doing that stuff anymore,
sweetheart. God's inside you.

408
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,686
Come on, I told you...

409
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,593
Asked and answered.

410
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,790
Come on. Come on. Give me.

411
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,332
Give me a name.

412
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,635
Some other thing like you.

413
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:33,366
That's offensive. I'm
a person. I'm a person.

414
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,498
We're not a club.

415
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,877
They're all horrible. Pixies
are dicks. Lycans are rapists.

416
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,380
And shape shifters, they all
headed west back in the '50s.

417
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,713
Thank you for that
color commentary.

418
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,649
Do you want this or
not? Give me a name.

419
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,188
Okay, okay. Okay, I got one.

420
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,015
Sort of pretty.

421
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,109
This must be what undergoing
the Vulcan ritual of Kolinahr is like.

422
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:22,314
I like your sweater.

423
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,115
Are you saying that to be cruel?

424
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,184
No. I like your sweater.

425
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,520
I saw no reason not to share.

426
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,294
Well, then,

427
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,935
shall we go fuck some shit up?

428
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,265
Yes. Yes.

429
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,329
Yes, definitely.
Definitely, yes.

430
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,603
Just remember,
if this is a lamia,

431
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,236
we're dealing with
a high-level psychic.

432
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,537
Yeah.

433
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,773
What are you saying to me?
I'm not saying anything to you.

434
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,046
Who do you think you
are? I just want a quarter.

435
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,672
Hey.

436
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,015
Chickadee!

437
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,385
Mom?

438
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,950
It's so good to see you.

439
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,891
I'm so, so sorry.

440
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:38,692
Baby, I missed you so much.

441
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,165
Kady, step back,
okay? It's not your mom.

442
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:46,969
I'm not an idiot, Julia.

443
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,568
Julia.

444
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,542
I forgive you.

445
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
I know what you are.

446
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,581
I'm trying to give you a gift.

447
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,444
Both of you. You need me.

448
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,914
My mom is dead,
bitch. Drop the act.

449
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,620
If you can read
my mind, you know

450
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,352
that we both have
knives in our pockets,

451
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,420
dipped in gold and silver
and coated in shark's blood.

452
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,755
Jesus, that's overkill.

453
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,530
We weren't sure which
legends were true.

454
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,997
I hate Ivy League girls.

455
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,937
Then tell us what
we want to hear,

456
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,599
and I'll get that
one out of your hair.

457
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,838
What? What do I have for you?

458
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,678
Look at this place. Look at me.

459
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,917
Lamiae were
servants of a goddess.

460
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,246
Back before the
birth of fire, maybe.

461
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,291
We want to petition her.

462
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,959
That's so cute.

463
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,496
But that's not what you want.

464
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,968
I know what you really want.

465
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,297
To be whole.

466
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,671
Like you were on that day
that you split into two Julias

467
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,049
and you got in that
elevator and lost everything.

468
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,119
Shut up.

469
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,087
I can give you that.

470
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,316
Get out of my head.

471
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,326
Fine. I'll be blunt.

472
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,188
She's dead.

473
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,690
They're all dead.

474
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,428
Call the gods all you want.

475
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,028
There's no one to hear you.

476
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,598
Let's go. Come on.

477
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,214
Anyway, "God is dead"
seems to be the consensus.

478
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,340
I don't accept that.

479
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,009
Well, the Lamia
seemed pretty convinced.

480
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,713
She was a bitter, half-starved
monster living in filth.

481
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,848
The gods have abandoned
her. It doesn't mean they're gone.

482
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,856
We have another
rock to turn over?

483
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,787
Not yet.

484
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,093
So then, what? I mean...

485
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,599
I don't know, Julia.

486
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,701
I mean, what do you want
me to say? "I give up"?

487
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,433
"Forget about ever really fixing
anything"? No, we keep trying, okay?

488
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,270
At least I do. You do
whatever you want.

489
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,169
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

490
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,173
I mean, this is my house.

491
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,722
You're bleeding a little.

492
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,083
That explains the burning pain.

493
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,688
Is that a Traveler thing?

494
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,527
It's a hearing voices thing.

495
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,131
Well, I guess that beats
whatever you were snorting.

496
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,328
Marginally.

497
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,136
That was an
unadulterated success.

498
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,644
Pity we have to put them back.

499
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,511
Agreed. Feelings are bullshit.

500
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,015
Let's just get this over with.

501
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,976
Right. Bottoms up.

502
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,827
Whoa!

503
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,193
Oh!

504
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,994
Quentin. Quentin,
you know I love you.

505
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:43,531
I love you so much, like so
much. You know that, right?

506
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,739
Yeah, I do, 'cause I feel
like I'm kind of, like, all alone.

507
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,979
Why aren't we
friends anymore, El?

508
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,312
We're best friends.

509
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,117
Can we be honest for
five seconds, please?

510
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,452
Honestly, I'd rather not.

511
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,833
You don't care about me.

512
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,536
That is stupid.

513
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,239
We are going to Fillory
to save everything.

514
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,841
It'll all be fine, like
before, except even better.

515
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,876
Now, catch up.

516
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,207
This is Daddy's
third drink, Bambi.

517
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,419
Jesus.

518
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,195
My head. I couldn't even sleep.

519
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,963
They were a bad
idea, the bottles.

520
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,000
I hate everything.
I hate air right now.

521
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,626
You have diagnosed depression.

522
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,069
Shouldn't be bottling you
up, you could... Kill myself?

523
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,938
I'm sure Plover
would get to me first.

524
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,409
I think we should try
mastering it without the bottles.

525
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,309
I'm sure you probably could.

526
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,077
I'm talking about all of us.

527
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,081
Not all of us are you, Alice.

528
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:07,284
Okay, you're hung over. I don't
think you meant that like it sounded.

529
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:11,085
I'm sorry. Yes. I just... I feel like
sometimes you don't hear yourself.

530
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,596
All I said was that I
think we should try...

531
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,031
This is what that looks like.

532
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:20,999
I am trying as hard as I can.

533
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,859
Okay.

534
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,834
If you're not dead...

535
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,540
So I'm listening.

536
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,837
Whatever... I'm here.

537
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,545
I want to do good.

538
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,253
Please.

539
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,266
Hey.

540
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,763
Troops coming?

541
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,396
Still at the cottage studying.
What are you doing?

542
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,872
Trying to get off the bottle.

543
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,838
Me, too. Any luck?

544
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,002
Not yet.

545
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,478
That wine bottle knows
its days are numbered.

546
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,352
Sit. Get Zen.

547
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,799
Every warrior in history
learned how to do it.

548
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,327
I bet plenty of them
were hot messes.

549
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,569
We can do this.

550
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,742
<i>Julia.</i>

551
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,331
Not so dead, am I?

552
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,801
Nothing was wasted, Julia.

553
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,442
Ever.

554
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,378
Everything has served
to pull you closer to me.

555
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:18,981
Find me.

556
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,983
Near the bridge,

557
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,059
there's a man who has
served me 1,000 years.

558
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,157
Bring him three gifts.

559
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,462
He'll show you the way.

560
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,635
Then I will come to you,
my beautiful daughter.

561
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,735
Holy shit.

562
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,774
This is a definite
wobble, right?

563
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,981
Hey. Hey.

564
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,484
I brought this for you,
in case you want it.

565
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,153
Not yet.

566
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,106
It's been three
and a half hours.

567
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
We're late.

568
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,041
It was worth it.

569
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,020
To being bosses.

570
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,596
Ha!

571
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:13,931
Okay.

572
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:28,078
Remember that spring at the
foot of the mountains in Fillory?

573
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,578
It was Chatwin's Torrent.

574
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,452
Thought you didn't
remember the books.

575
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,712
Rupert was wounded, right?

576
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,418
Till the spring healed his leg?

577
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,752
You think it's real?

578
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,689
Some of the good
parts have to be.

579
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,024
At least, I hope so.

580
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,002
Why?

581
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,136
Because I probably
have liver damage.

582
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,241
On that note, we're out of wine.

583
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,954
On that note, we're out of wine.

584
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,215
Fine, I'll go.

585
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,428
Cheers.

586
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,130
Jesus, you two.

587
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,648
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

588
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,812
It's okay.

589
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,314
Thanks for reminding
me it's there.

590
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,816
Okay, it's your turn.

591
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:51,595
You can do it.

592
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:01,368
We are going to Fillory.

593
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,338
Oh, my God.

594
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,082
You're Toto, and
you are Dorothy.

595
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,150
Yeah.

596
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:16,450
And I am flying Muppets.

597
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:17,947
One step.

598
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,183
Meerkats. Two step.

599
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,249
No, wait. That's not it.

600
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,163
And I think he passed out.

601
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,902
Finally.

602
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,915
You know he was... He was
talking about Chatwin's Torrent.

603
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,942
Let's be honest.

604
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,582
There's a lot more wrong
with Eliot than a broken leg.

605
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:04,796
Yeah, but the spring
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

606
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,400
It healed him.

607
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,802
All of him.

608
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,973
Here's the thing about you, Q.

609
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,908
You actually believe in magic.

610
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,909
So does everyone.

611
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:20,984
No.

612
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,979
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

613
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,357
You just love it,
pure and simple.

614
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:40,400
You know, I've never
loved something like that.

615
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,709
That's not true.

616
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,044
Maybe Fillory can fix him

617
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,153
'cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

618
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,925
It's okay.

619
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,432
We're gonna do whatever we can.

620
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:15,539
I promise.
