a preliminary exam</i>

4

Regrettably,
you failed the written exam.

6
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:15,056
- Can I start over?
- There's this voice.

with a lot of static,

8

but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

9

- I was getting duped.

- Here it is.
- Wait, Martin?

That's... okay, is there

31
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,682
anything in there

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,388
Go back to the part
where you literally

33
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:12,117
popped in on them banging.

34
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:13,790
We were casting a spell.

35
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,626
- No judgment.
- We saved your life.

36
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,657
All right, so there might
be a solution here.

37
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,996
Uh, a weapon.

38
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,227
It sounds like if
we could find it,

39
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:23,232
we could use it
to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:26,302
El! Jesus!

41
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:28,338
It's 11:00 in the morning.

42
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,969
I'm listening.

43
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:33,243
So Martin's desperate,
'cause the Plover had

44
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,013
figured out a way
to change physically,

45
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,282
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

46
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:39,451
which meant
that pretty soon he'd be able

47
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:41,080
to follow Martin into Fillory.

48
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,845
- [mumbles]
- Yeah.

49
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:48,289
So Martin got a line
on an enchanted knife, the Leo.

50
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,126
Uh...

51
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,857
Yeah, powerful enough to tear

52
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,702
through the fabric of
magic itself... like, kill a god.

53
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:59,468
So qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

54
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,270
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

55
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,839
I fucking love that guy.

56
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,508
Yeah, so Martin
tracked down the knife maker,

57
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,638
asked him if he could
make him one,

58
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:08,378
and the guy said,

59
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,379
uh...

60
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,116
"Yeah, I can."

61
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:14,647
And then what?

62
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:17,152
Uh, well, that's the end
of the pages.

63
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,392
Yeah, nothing happened.

64
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,689
If Martin killed The Beast,

65
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,360
would we be here now
talking about him?

66
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,288
Yeah, but here's the thing.

67
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:25,862
So little did Martin know

68
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:28,063
he would fail
to recover the blade,

69
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,695
which would remain hidden
for decades,

70
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,570
which means it could still
be sitting somewhere

71
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,169
waiting for us.

72
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,039
Right, in Fillory.

73
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,708
The place where The Beast is.

74
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,709
Ergo, fuck that.

75
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,648
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

76
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,479
Plover wants the button back?

77
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,084
Why don't we just
give it to him?

78
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,986
I... I don't think
that's a very good plan.

79
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:52,818
No, that's
a monumentally shitty plan.

80
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,357
I don't know.

81
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,388
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

82
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,062
So what if we hand them
the button,

83
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,563
thereby giving The Beast
what he wants,

84
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,434
thereby rendering
ourselves harmless,

85
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,333
thereby he leaves us alone?

86
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,165
Right, 'cause handing the key
to the multiverse to a monster

87
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,900
is a really...
that's a good idea, Eliot.

88
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,735
- Beats getting vivisected.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

89
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,871
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel to Fillory

90
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,536
so he keeps it all to himself,
I'm still a problem.

91
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:19,406
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

92
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,716
The rest of us do not
have that luxury.

93
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,189
So let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea

94
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,618
out of bed.

95
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,023
Okay, stop.

96
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,292
This affects all of us.

97
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,533

of striking a deal.

98

00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,864
- It's time, Richard.
- Contact how?

179
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,925
Humans aren't
their only children;

180
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,068
there are others

181
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:42,599
who are older
and might know more.

182
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,106
Magical creatures.

183
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,178
You mean like vampires
and unicorns?

184
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,679
Uh, I think unicorns are a myth.

185
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:53,182
But yes.

186
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:55,453
Find something high up enough
in the hierarchy,

187
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,590
they might actually remember
when gods and humans

188
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,018
were on speaking terms.

189
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,792
And there's
a huge cross-section of them

190
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,191
right here in the city.

191
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,761
Yeah, because
they want to use us.

192
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:04,890
Look, you're right.

193
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,185
Most of them know nothing other

194
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,296
than hunger, thirst,
and how to hide,

195
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,598
but it's a food chain,
all right?

196
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,101
We start at the bottom;
we work our way up

197
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:16,202
till we find someone
who can help us get to them.

198
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,906
How long have you been at this?

199
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:20,076
A while.

200
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:21,577
I won't lie.

201
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,308
You know, it's been tough going.

202
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,614
Bender, show them.

203
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:31,120
Mostly bloodsuckers,
useless junkies,

204
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:34,090
but sometimes you can get
a lead on to something else.

205
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,731
After they talk your ear off
for, like, 12 hours.

206
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,328
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

207
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,031
but I think we have an ace
up our sleeve now.

208
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,739
- Julia.
- What?

209
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,770
That prayer I gave you,
you know,

210
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,105
doesn't work for everyone.

211
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,941
Actually, you're the first.

212
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,446
I don't understand.

213
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,007
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

214
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,016
but I gave you a test.

215
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,249
Why? I'm not religious.

216
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,755
I'm not a... I'm not anything.

217
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:11,327
We don't know
why some people are god-touched.

218
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,258
All right? There's
no rhyme or reason.

219
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:16,298
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

220
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,199
But it's you, Julia.

221
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,171
I think if we send you
on the hunt,

222
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,942
we're gonna get some results.

223
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,570
[scoffs softly]

224
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,210
I don't know.
Penny was pretty clear.

225
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,175
- What are we planning?
- Nothing yet.

226
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:37,215
Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

227
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,950
before we even
set foot in Fillory

228
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:41,785
because the Neitherlands
are full of mercenaries.

229
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,322
Sounds like a problem.

230
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,326
Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.

231
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,528
But that stuff's illegal.

232
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:50,631
I'm fucking with you.
I'm in.

233
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,134
I'm in too.

234
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,135
I heard the word "illegal."

235
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,967
Oh, Alice, there's a note
for you from admin.

236
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,613
I see you've got a call.

237
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,979
Mom, please, just calm down.

238
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,580
I can't understand you.

239
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:10,047
You what?

240
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:13,189
I'm so sorry.

241
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,391
I have to go.
I'll call you as soon as I can.

242
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,363
It's Joe.

243
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:25,095
He killed himself.

244
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,802
- What?
- I have to talk to Penny.

245
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,512
My mom says
he was hearing voices

246
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,613
and always getting worse

247
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,546
and that the voices
were threatening him.

248
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,653
He's a traveler... he was
a traveler... and I just thought...

249
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,285
I know what happened
to her friend.

250
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,396
It's The Beast.

Shit.

252
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,933
Yeah, I got it under control.

253
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,874
Penny, maybe you should think
about the possibility

254
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,637
that he's targeting you guys.

255
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,038
I mean, you're
like a walking button.

256
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,709
Think you're
telling me anything new?

257
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,947
Sorry, I... I should go.

258
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,448
Penny, where are you gonna go?

259
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,051
We can find a way to help you.

260
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,852
I'm sorry.
I got to talk to someone.

<i>Stanley, man, you there?</i>

262
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,496
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

263
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,737
You been hearing him too?

264
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:37,738
He knows everything there is
about me...

265
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,771
my son's home address,

266

describes my granddaughter's
every freckle.

267
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,912
Look, man, he's targeting us

268
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,952
because we can hear him,
because we can travel.

269
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,580
I mean, he wants all the roads

270
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,485
in and out of his fortress
on lock.

I got a plan,

276
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,625
and there's nothing
he can do to stop me.

277
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,936
Yeah? Well, what's the plan?

278
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:11,337
Watch... and trust me.

279
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:14,009
This removes all his leverage.

280

a damn thing.

from World War II?

285

My Japanese is a little rusty,

287
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,628

"Majikku misairu."

"Magic missile"?

289

"Dungeons & Dragons."

- What? No.

Great. Let's go native.

with a broadsword, Quentin?

00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:50,435
There's a lot more wrong
with Eliot than a broken leg.

714
00:39:56,511 --> 00:40:00,481
Yeah, but the spring

715
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,718
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

716
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,949
It healed him.

717
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,485
All of him.

718
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,127
There's this thing about you, Q.

719
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:15,198
You actually believe in magic.

720
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:20,825
- So does everyone.
- No.

721
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,266
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

722
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:28,784
And you just love it,
pure and simple.

723
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:38,622
You know, I've never loved
something like that.

724
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,891
That's not true.

725
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:51,064
Maybe Fillory can fix him.

726
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,396
'Cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

727
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,080
It's okay.

728
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:12,419
We're gonna do whatever we can.

729
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,490
I promise.
