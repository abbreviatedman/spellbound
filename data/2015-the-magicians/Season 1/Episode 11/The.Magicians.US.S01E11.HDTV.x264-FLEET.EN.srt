1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:01,493
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,784
<i>- Okay, what is this place?
- Brakebills University.</i>

3
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,476
<i>You've been offered
a preliminary exam</i>

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,478
<i>for entry into the graduate program.</i>

5
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,114
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

6
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:13,684
- Can I start over?
- There's this voice.

7
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,352
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

8
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,854
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

9
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,890
- You're hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

10
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:21,625
I'm Stanley.

11
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:24,206
I'm your mentor.
Travelers are rare.

12
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:25,893
- Where are we?
- The Neitherlands.

13
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:27,628
The place between all other places.

14
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:28,963
My friend's life is in danger,

15
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:30,731
and I need to talk to you about Joe.

16
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:34,135
Joe?
Oh, I love Joe.

17
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,370
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

18
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:37,595
How can I help?

19
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:41,008
We are pushing the boundaries
of what is magically possible.

20
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:43,311
We are the best Magicians we know.

21
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:44,979
<i>Silver can literally fly to the moon</i>

22
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:46,714
<i>but mentally is dying.</i>

23
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:48,749
<i>Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.</i>

24
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:51,052
- You're trying to--
- Summon a god.

25
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:52,887
Oh!

26
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,855
I'm a member
of The Order, the keepers

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,390
of the libraries of the Neitherlands,

28
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:57,992
the greatest repository of knowledge.

29
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,560
- Here it is.
- Wait, Martin?

30
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:00,761
That's--okay, is there

31
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:02,596
anything in there about The Beast?

32
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:09,337
Go back to the part
where you literally

33
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:11,072
popped in on them banging.

34
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,740
We were casting a spell.

35
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,576
- No judgment.
- We saved your life.

36
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,611
All right, so there might
be a solution here.

37
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:18,946
Uh, a weapon.

38
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,181
It sounds like if we could find it,

39
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:22,183
we could use it to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:25,252
El! Jesus!

41
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:27,288
It's 11:00 in the morning.

42
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:28,923
I'm listening.

43
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:32,193
So Martin's desperate,
'cause the Plover had

44
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,961
figured out a way
to change physically,

45
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:36,230
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

46
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,399
which meant
that pretty soon he'd be able

47
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,034
to follow Martin into Fillory.

48
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,802
Yeah.

49
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:44,538
So Martin got a line

50
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,241
on an enchanted knife, the Leo.

51
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,076
Uh...

52
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,811
Yeah, powerful enough to tear

53
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,647
through the fabric of
magic itself--like, kill a god.

54
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:58,419
So qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

55
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,221
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

56
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,789
I fucking love that guy.

57
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,457
Yeah, so Martin
tracked down the knife maker,

58
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:04,592
asked him if he could make him one,

59
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:07,328
and the guy said,

60
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,330
uh...

61
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:12,066
"Yeah, I can."

62
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,601
And then what?

63
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:16,103
Uh, well, that's the end
of the pages.

64
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,338
Yeah, nothing happened.

65
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:18,639
If Martin killed The Beast,

66
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,307
would we be here now
talking about him?

67
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,243
Yeah, but here's the thing.

68
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:24,812
So little did Martin know

69
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,014
he would fail to recover the blade,

70
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,649
which would remain hidden
for decades,

71
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,523
which means it could still
be sitting somewhere

72
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,119
waiting for us.

73
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,989
Right, in Fillory.

74
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,658
The place where The Beast is.

75
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:40,628
Ergo, fuck that.

76
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:44,598
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

77
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,434
Plover wants the button back?

78
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,035
Why don't we just give it to him?

79
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,937
I--I don't think
that's a very good plan.

80
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,772
No, that's
a monumentally shitty plan.

81
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,307
I don't know.

82
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,342
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

83
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:58,012
So what if we hand them the button,

84
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,513
thereby giving The Beast
what he wants,

85
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,382
thereby rendering ourselves harmless,

86
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,284
thereby he leaves us alone?

87
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,119
Right, 'cause handing the key
to the multiverse to a monster

88
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,854
is a really--
that's a good idea, Eliot.

89
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:09,690
- Beats getting vivisected.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

90
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,826
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel to Fillory

91
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,495
so he keeps it all to himself,
I'm still a problem.

92
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:18,365
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,668
The rest of us do not
have that luxury.

94
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,137
So let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea

95
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,572
out of bed.

96
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,973
Okay, stop.

97
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,242
This affects all of us.

98
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:31,445
So those in favor of striking a deal.

99
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,222
Sorry. It's the right move.

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,429
Because you still seem,
I don't know, gloomy about it.

101
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,431
I can't believe you're not.
Penny's been gone for a week.

102
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,600
Which is like an hour
in the Neitherlands, right?

103
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:55,769
It means nothing.
What if it works?

104
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:58,405
Then it works. The Beast
leaves us alone, great.

105
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,607
You're just upset 'cause
you may never get

106
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:01,175
to go to Fillory.

107
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,677
No, that would be stupid.

108
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,346
- Quentin.
- Why would I want to go?

109
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,747
The child-molesting demon

110
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:07,781
who incidentally wrote
my favorite books

111
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,917
is there waiting to kill us.

112
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:14,955
Come on. We're late for P.A.

113
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:31,205
No!

114
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:38,879
Please, wake up!

115
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:42,917
Margo, how did this happen?

116
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,487
We should have listened to you, Q.

117
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,617
You think you're hiding, don't you?

118
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:47,281
Sleep tight, Quentin Coldwater.

119
00:05:50,402 --> 00:06:10,910
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

120
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:21,315
No way in hell we're doing
that fucking spell again.

121
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,518
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little shaky.

122
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,986
I don't like dying.

123
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:30,090
- No kidding.
- You are Margo.

124
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,859
You are fabulous.

125
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,396
You are under the influence
of a probability spell.

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,466
I am fabulous, aren't I?

127
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,533
- Yeah.
- What happened to you?

128
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,269
Beast ripped my head off
in the Neitherlands.

129
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,638
So much for negotiating my freedom.

130
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,241
All right, well, this was a dead end.

131
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,709
Well, I hate to say I told you so,

132
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,244
but--you know what?

133
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,112
Actually, I don't.
I don't.

134
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,580
I don't hate that.

135
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,884
This is the last one.

136
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,652
- It's dead.
- Ugh.

137
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,037
We're not learning anything new.

138
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:04,757
In every scenario,
The Beast comes next week.

139
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,426
There was one time
we didn't all die--

140
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,661
when we went to Fillory.

141
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,263
No. Everything went white.

142
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,331
It's not necessarily better.

143
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,766
Well, I agree with Quentin.

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,601
Oh, that's because he blows you.

145
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,436
Seriously, eight tries.

146
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,572
We get seven deaths, one mysterious?

147
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,807
I--give me that.

148
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,609
I don't think that we have a choice.

149
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,444
No, I'm choosing to get the fuck

150
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,612
away from all of you.

151
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,824
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

152
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,960
<i>Been a while.</i>

153
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,662
<i>Do say you missed me a little.</i>

154
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,598
Fuck you.

155
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,434
<i>Let me cut to the chase.</i>

156
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,503
<i>You will deliver yourself to me.</i>

157
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,272
<i>Do it now, or do it
when you've gone so mad</i>

158
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,107
<i>you have nothing left,</i>

159
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,811
<i>because I'm going to make it
very, very loud.</i>

160
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:05,051
Here's the deal: people used
to petition gods all the time

161
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,486
to bestow power to work stuff

162
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,788
that we'd never dream of.

163
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,191
Now, they're it--biggest source
there is.

164
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:16,128
At least they were, question being...

165
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,697
Where the hell are they now?

166
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,898
Exactly.

167
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,199
No one's spoken
to a god in centuries.

168
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,802
They disappeared.

169
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,137
Um, I believe that we can find a way

170
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,340
to contact them again
to get the kind of help

171
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,841
they used to give.

172
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,012
- It's time, Richard.
- Contact how?

173
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,081
Humans aren't their only children;

174
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,216
there are others

175
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,753
who are older and might know more.

176
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,221
Magical creatures.

177
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,326
You mean like vampires and unicorns?

178
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,829
Uh, I think unicorns are a myth.

179
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,330
But yes.

180
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,599
Find something high up enough
in the hierarchy,

181
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,735
they might actually remember
when gods and humans

182
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,169
were on speaking terms.

183
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,938
And there's
a huge cross-section of them

184
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,339
right here in the city.

185
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,907
Yeah, because they want to use us.

186
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,042
Look, you're right.

187
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,343
Most of them know nothing other

188
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,445
than hunger, thirst, and how to hide,

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,748
but it's a food chain, all right?

190
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,249
We start at the bottom;
we work our way up

191
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,353
till we find someone
who can help us get to them.

192
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,055
How long have you been at this?

193
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,224
A while.

194
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,725
I won't lie.

195
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,461
You know, it's been tough going.

196
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,268
Bender, show them.

197
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,268
Mostly bloodsuckers, useless junkies,

198
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,238
but sometimes you can get
a lead on to something else.

199
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,063
After they talk your ear off
for, like, 12 hours.

200
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,478
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

201
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:43,482
but I think we have an ace
up our sleeve now.

202
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,887
- Julia.
- What?

203
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,922
That prayer I gave you, you know,

204
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,258
doesn't work for everyone.

205
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,093
Actually, you're the first.

206
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,594
I don't understand.

207
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,163
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

208
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,166
but I gave you a test.

209
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,402
Why? I'm not religious.

210
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,905
I'm not a--I'm not anything.

211
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,475
We don't know
why some people are god-touched.

212
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,410
All right? There's
no rhyme or reason.

213
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,447
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

214
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,349
But it's you, Julia.

215
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,319
I think if we send you on the hunt,

216
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,088
we're gonna get some results.

217
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,362
I don't know.
Penny was pretty clear.

218
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,332
- What are we planning?
- Nothing yet.

219
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,367
Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

220
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,103
before we even set foot in Fillory

221
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,939
because the Neitherlands
are full of mercenaries.

222
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,474
Sounds like a problem.

223
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,476
Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.

224
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,678
But that stuff's illegal.

225
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,781
I'm fucking with you.
I'm in.

226
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,282
I'm in too.

227
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,284
I heard the word "illegal."

228
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,121
Oh, Alice, there's a note
for you from admin.

229
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,723
I see you've got a call.

230
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,128
Mom, please, just calm down.

231
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,696
I can't understand you.

232
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,200
You what?

233
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,337
I'm so sorry.

234
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,738
I have to go.

235
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,507
I'll call you as soon as I can.

236
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,513
It's Joe.

237
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,249
He killed himself.

238
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,918
- What?
- I have to talk to Penny.

239
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,660
My mom says he was hearing voices

240
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,763
and always getting worse

241
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,700
and that the voices
were threatening him.

242
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,770
He's a traveler--he was
a traveler--and I just thought--

243
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,407
I know what happened to her friend.

244
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,545
It's The Beast.

245
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,380
Shit.

246
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,081
Yeah, I got it under control.

247
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,017
Penny, maybe you should think
about the possibility

248
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,785
that he's targeting you guys.

249
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,187
I mean, you're like a walking button.

250
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,822
Think you're telling me anything new?

251
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:10,095
Sorry, I--I should go.

252
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,598
Penny, where are you gonna go?

253
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,200
We can find a way to help you.

254
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,968
I'm sorry.
I got to talk to someone.

255
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:27,613
<i>Stanley, man, you there?</i>

256
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,649
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

257
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,885
You been hearing him too?

258
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,888
He knows everything there is
about me--

259
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,923
my son's home address,

260
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,459
describes my granddaughter's
every freckle.

261
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,061
Look, man, he's targeting us

262
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,097
because we can hear him,
because we can travel.

263
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,732
I mean, he wants all the roads

264
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,634
in and out of his fortress on lock.

265
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,069
No shit.

266
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,440
Like I want to travel
to a blue state,

267
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,176
never mind other worlds.

268
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,844
What do we do?

269
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,613
I got a plan,

270
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,781
and there's nothing
he can do to stop me.

271
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,084
Yeah? Well, what's the plan?

272
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,488
Watch...and trust me.

273
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,157
This removes all his leverage.

274
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,428
He can't make me do a damn thing.

275
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,770
Uh, where did you get this?

276
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,435
Is this, like, from World War II?

277
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,103
I tripped and fell on it
locked in a drawer

278
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,271
in Sunderland's office.

279
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:29,839
My Japanese is a little rusty,

280
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:33,209
but I think that this says,
"Majikku misairu."

281
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:35,979
"Magic missile"?

282
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,415
That's, like,

283
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,016
straight-up
"Dungeons & Dragons."

284
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,218
Oh, okay.

285
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,020
Uh...

286
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,622
Do you want to--okay.

287
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,990
Move.

288
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:03,440
Your Popper 43 is off.

289
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,616
Huh?

290
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,150
What if we got guns?

291
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:15,585
What? No.

292
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,754
No, look,
this is basic prime directive.

293
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:21,558
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society.

294
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,994
- You can't--
- Oh, yes, very pristine.

295
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,429
It's been taken over
by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

296
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,798
Yeah, and that's not Fillory's fault.

297
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,567
Great. Let's go native.

298
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,137
Scale of one to ten, how are you
with a broadsword, Quentin?

299
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,338
This should have worked.

300
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,107
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.

301
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,309
I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

302
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,479
One time or another.
Eliot, you--

303
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,648
Twisted Mike's neck
like a doll? Yeah.

304
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,016
And it was shockingly easy.

305
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,584
I don't have an explainer for you.

306
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,086
Yeah, and it just
sort of came puking out.

307
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:53,356
Well, where'd you learn it?

308
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,724
I know who we need to talk to.

309
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:59,596
<i>Tonight, or I kill the girl</i>

310
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,964
<i>in the dungeon.</i>

311
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,870
Quentin.

312
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,508
No. Whatever it is, just no.

313
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,844
Look, we need your help.

314
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,313
We're trying to locate your ex.

315
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,289
Penny, please.

316
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,425
I know, but this is really
that important.

317
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,204
It feels jacked to be
doing a mirror spell

318
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,566
in here, seriously.

319
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,135
- Just focus.
- It's not working!

320
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,470
Because she's a good magician,

321
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,539
and she doesn't want to be found.

322
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,641
Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but--

323
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,042
The reflection's changing.

324
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,996
- You're welcome.
- Penny.

325
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,264
Come with us.

326
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,202
I know this place.

327
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,639
That's Julia's apartment.

328
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,376
Shit.

329
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,546
Okay.

330
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,255
Uh, hi.
Could we come in?

331
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,525
Um, Julia's not here.

332
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,260
She won't be back for a couple hours.

333
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,596
Yeah, we're here
to talk to you, actually.

334
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,599
Okay. Um...

335
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,937
<i>Please, please,
give him what he wants!</i>

336
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:03,887
I think that's
an insanely stupid idea.

337
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,390
You don't just go fight
someone stronger on his turf.

338
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,259
We know.
We have a plan for The Beast.

339
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,161
We just need to make sure
we have enough under our belt

340
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,929
to even make it to him.

341
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,998
Let's just say you're very likely

342
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,933
to be mugged in the Neitherlands.

343
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:20,170
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't teach it to you.

344
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,172
Look, most people
can't do battle magic

345
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:25,341
except in crazy spurts.

346
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,777
Like baby-trapped-under-a-car
type shit.

347
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,479
But you can do it on cue.

348
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,993
Yeah, 'cause I studied it for years.

349
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:33,683
Give us the CliffsNotes.

350
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,084
Fine.

351
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,520
Meditate every day
for, like, a decade.

352
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:40,456
And spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.

353
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,958
Great.

354
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:43,693
So we're stuck with
our dicks in our hands.

355
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:51,301
Look, there is this thing hedges use.

356
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:52,969
But I really wouldn't recommend it.

357
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:56,272
Okay.

358
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,640
Now we're listening.

359
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,715
<i>She bleeds so easily,
poor little thing.</i>

360
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,550
Fuck!

361
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,819
<i>I barely touched her.</i>

362
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:20,997
Hey.

363
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,503
Look, um...

364
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,675
So...

365
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,346
How is she?
Julia, I mean.

366
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,381
Why do you care after
what she did to you?

367
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,086
Okay.
It's none of your business.

368
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,154
You know, that's not how it works.

369
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,056
Giving a shit about someone
that you give a shit about

370
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,131
doesn't just evaporate
the second that they fuck up.

371
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,597
So why don't you just admit that
you want to ask me about Penny?

372
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,103
Okay, fine.

373
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,772
Look, Julia is good.

374
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,674
Great, actually.

375
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,609
Like, we're working on something
that could help a lot of people,

376
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,810
so it's good.

377
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:14,951
Okay, now you--is he okay?

378
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:18,021
Yeah, he's extra broody, but...

379
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,355
you know, it's Penny;

380
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,391
he's fireproof.

381
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,760
He's like cockroaches; he'll
survive the nuclear winter.

382
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:45,148
<i>You can end it.</i>

383
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,617
<i>Just end it.</i>

384
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,118
Shut up.

385
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:52,588
Shut the hell up.

386
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,223
Okay.

387
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,992
Okay, look.

388
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,101
Please help me.

389
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:17,095
You should thank Alice Quinn.

390
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,931
She found you.

391
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:23,402
- Get on with the lecture.
- Oh, I've overdosed once.

392
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,003
No, twice, if you count the time

393
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:28,740
I took so much Prozac,
I developed tardive dyskinesia,

394
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,410
but that was an accident.

395
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:35,747
The crack--that was
a straight OD, no chaser.

396
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,950
You smoked crack?

397
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:41,420
I've done things that would
make you hide under a blankie.

398
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,823
So just tell me what's happening.

399
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:47,793
A voice from another world
has a thing for travelers.

400
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,428
So it's an assault.

401
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,663
That's a nice mild term for it.

402
00:20:56,436 --> 00:21:01,940
This goes on the base of your neck.

403
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:06,178
It blocks the flow
to your head like a dam.

404
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,180
You didn't think
of giving this to me sooner?

405
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,949
It's not approved.

406
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:14,786
It wears down the mind's
own ability to defend itself.

407
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:16,221
It's just a temporary fix

408
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,457
until we can put you
on a stricter regimen.

409
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,325
I don't have time for this.

410
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:26,098
Penny, you will never have a home.

411
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,469
You will never have a real family.

412
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:35,874
Your gifts will take this
from you over and over.

413
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:40,879
So when someone cares enough
to reach out a hand,

414
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,915
just drop the bullshit attitude

415
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:46,118
and take what they're offering
while you can.

416
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:52,090
Bottling our emotions, literally.

417
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,161
Kady says we shouldn't use these

418
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,496
for more than three hours
at a time, right?

419
00:21:57,563 --> 00:22:00,032
That it's too hard on the system,

420
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,434
and when the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.

421
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:03,869
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,771
Don't lean on the bottle.

423
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,373
But meanwhile we get to go
full Spock with battle magic.

424
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,343
- I don't like it.
- Um, it's the perfect cheat.

425
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,411
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it;

426
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:13,779
I said I didn't like it.

427
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,451
Wow, you look--

428
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,253
Damn handsome for someone
who just had a heart attack?

429
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,989
What can I say?
Genetically blessed.

430
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:28,260
- What are those?
- What do you care?

431
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,295
I thought you wanted
nothing to do with us.

432
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:32,964
I changed my mind.

433
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:36,268
I'll go to Fillory on one condition.

434
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:40,439
That girl you saw in the dungeon?

435
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,640
Yeah, we'll get her out.

436
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:44,910
Deal.

437
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,981
Well, this somehow
doesn't feel like a place

438
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,617
where anyone knows anything.

439
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:55,487
Well, apparently
this guy's old as dirt.

440
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:58,023
Got to start somewhere.

441
00:22:58,691 --> 00:22:59,891
Who knows.

442
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,732
<i>♪ 'Cause you can't hold back
what you can't attract ♪</i>

443
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,968
<i>♪ The subtle attention
of time ♪</i>

444
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,304
<i>♪ If you see her,
just let me know ♪</i>

445
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,840
<i>♪ I plan to make
this woman mine ♪</i>

446
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,208
Girls.

447
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,478
Agency sent you?

448
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:22,647
- You Bjorn?
- I asked for blondes.

449
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,817
I heard about you from a girl
who got fired from a blood bank

450
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,186
on 67th about a year ago.

451
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:30,589
Apparently, she wasn't
stealing for herself.

452
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,924
Tracy sold me out?

453
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,292
What'd you give her?

454
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,294
Honestly, 20 bucks.

455
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,830
So I don't think that was true love.

456
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:42,801
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- We just have a few questions.

457
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:45,871
- Mm.
- We'll pay.

458
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:48,440
20 whole dollars, rich bitch?

459
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,650
Whose is it?

460
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,919
Mine, so it's
the cleanest thing in this room.

461
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,557
We want to petition a god.

462
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,529
Um, a--a god?

463
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:14,366
You mean--you mean like "a god"?

464
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:17,335
Nobody's doing that stuff
anymore, sweetheart.

465
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:19,371
God's inside you.

466
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:22,207
- Come on, I told you--
- Hey, asked and answered.

467
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,510
- Come on. Give me it.
- Give me a name.

468
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,012
Some other thing like you.

469
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,813
Hey, that's offensive.

470
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:31,216
I'm a person.
I'm a person.

471
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,051
We're not a club.

472
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,187
They're all horrible.

473
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:37,689
Pixies are dicks,
the lycans are rapists,

474
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,024
and shapeshifters,
they all headed west

475
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,325
back in the '50s.

476
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:42,527
Thank you for that color commentary.

477
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:44,162
Do you want this or not?
Give me a name.

478
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,364
Okay, okay. Okay.

479
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:47,599
I got one.

480
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,893
Huh. Sort of pretty.

481
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,761
This must be what undergoing
the Vulcan ritual

482
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,930
of Kolinahr is like.

483
00:25:18,998 --> 00:25:21,099
I like your sweater.

484
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,401
Are you saying that to be cruel?

485
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:26,705
No. I like your sweater.

486
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,106
I saw no reason not to share.

487
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,277
Well, then.

488
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,613
Shall we go fuck some shit up?

489
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,047
- Yes.
- Yes.

490
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,582
Yes, definitely.
Definitely.

491
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
Just remember, if this is a Lamia,

492
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:45,223
we're dealing
with a high-level psychic.

493
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,591
Yeah.

494
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,818
What are you saying to me?

495
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:16,254
I'm not saying anything to you.

496
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:18,823
Who do you think you are?
I just want a quarter.

497
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:22,460
Hey.

498
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:25,138
- Chickadee.
- Mom?

499
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,862
It's so good to see you.

500
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:31,332
I'm so, so sorry.

501
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:36,243
Baby, I missed you so much.

502
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:42,109
Kady, step back, okay?
It's not your mom.

503
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,644
I'm not an idiot, Julia.

504
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,848
Julia...

505
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:50,051
I forgive you.

506
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:54,121
- I know what you are.
- I'm trying to give you a gift.

507
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:56,991
Both of you.
You need me.

508
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,392
My mom is dead, bitch.

509
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:00,227
Drop the act.

510
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:02,463
If you can read my mind, you
know that we both have knives

511
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,333
in our pockets
dipped in gold and silver

512
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,868
and coated in shark's blood.

513
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:10,304
Jesus, that's overkill.

514
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,574
We weren't sure
which legends were true.

515
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,843
I hate Ivy League girls.

516
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:17,578
Then tell us what we want to hear,

517
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:19,980
and I'll get that one
out of your hair.

518
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,716
What?

519
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,518
What do I have for you?

520
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:29,724
Uh, look at this place.
Look at me.

521
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:32,526
Lamiae were servants of a goddess.

522
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:34,929
Back before the birth of fire, maybe.

523
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,564
We want to petition her.

524
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:44,505
Oh. That's so cute.

525
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,107
But that's not what you want.

526
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:51,379
I know what you really
want--

527
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:55,449
to be whole...

528
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,352
like you were on that day

529
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,454
that you split into two Julias

530
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:03,924
and you got in that elevator
and lost everything.

531
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,426
Shut up.

532
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,895
- I can give you that.
- Get out of my head.

533
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,297
Fine.

534
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:11,732
I'll be blunt.

535
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,268
She's dead.

536
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,438
They're all dead.

537
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:21,242
Call the gods all you want.

538
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:24,378
There's no one to hear you.

539
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,248
Let's go.
Come on.

540
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,152
Anyway, "God is dead"

541
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:33,053
seems to be the consensus.

542
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,321
I don't accept that.

543
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:35,923
Well, Lamia seemed pretty convinced.

544
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,559
She was a bitter, half-starved
monster living in filth.

545
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,227
The gods have abandoned her.

546
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,329
It doesn't mean they're gone.

547
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,466
We got another rock to turn over?

548
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,102
Not yet.

549
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:51,906
- So then what?
- I don't know, Julia.

550
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,475
I mean, what do you want me
to say? "I give up"?

551
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,343
"Forget about ever
really fixing anything"?

552
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,145
No, we keep trying, okay?

553
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,648
At least I do.
You do whatever you want.

554
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:03,517
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

555
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:05,186
I mean, this is my house.

556
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,263
You're bleeding a little.

557
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,798
That explains the burning pain.

558
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,935
Is that a traveler thing?

559
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,437
It's a hearing voices thing.

560
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:26,006
Well, I guess that beats
whatever you were snorting.

561
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,374
Marginally.

562
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:08,883
That was an unadulterated success.

563
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,351
Pity we have to put them back.

564
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:13,220
Agreed.
Feelings are bullshit.

565
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:15,723
Let's just get this over with.

566
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:18,292
Right.
Bottoms up.

567
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,901
Whoa.

568
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,609
Quentin.
Quentin.

569
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:36,944
You know I love you.

570
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:38,712
I love you so much.
Like, so much.

571
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:40,681
You know that, right?

572
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,384
Yeah, do you know--'cause
I feel like, uh, I'm kind of,

573
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:45,553
like, all alone.

574
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,888
Why aren't we friends anymore, El?

575
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:49,957
We're best friends.

576
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:54,595
Can we be honest
for five seconds, please?

577
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:57,131
Honestly...

578
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,799
I'd rather not.

579
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,938
You don't care about me.

580
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:07,308
That is stupid.

581
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,246
We are going to Fillory
to save everything.

582
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,615
It'll all be fine, like before,

583
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:16,317
except even better.

584
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:17,685
Now catch up.

585
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:22,089
This is Daddy's third drink, Bambi.

586
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,673
Jesus.

587
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:31,910
Oh my head.

588
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,611
I couldn't even sleep.

589
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:35,747
They were a bad idea, the bottles.

590
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:36,814
I hate everything.

591
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:37,916
I hate air right now.

592
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,584
You have diagnosed depression.

593
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:40,885
Shouldn't be bottling you up;
you could--

594
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,120
Kill myself?

595
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,690
I'm sure Plover
would get to me first.

596
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,160
I think we should try mastering it

597
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,562
without the bottles.

598
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:53,164
I'm sure you probably could.

599
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:55,133
I'm talking about all of us.

600
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,535
Not all of us are you, Alice.

601
00:31:57,603 --> 00:31:59,003
Okay.

602
00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:00,838
You're hung over.

603
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:02,941
I don't think you meant that
like it sounded.

604
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,709
I'm sorry. Yes.

605
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:06,844
I just--I feel like sometimes
you don't hear yourself.

606
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,314
All I said was
that I think we should try--

607
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:12,083
This is what that looks like.

608
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:16,721
I am trying as hard as I can.

609
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:45,850
Okay.
Uh...

610
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:52,824
If you're not dead, I'm listening.

611
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:59,597
Whatever--I'm here.

612
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:05,169
I want to do good.

613
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:09,774
Please.

614
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,150
Hey.

615
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:20,818
Troops coming?

616
00:33:20,886 --> 00:33:22,926
Still at the cottage studying.
What are you doing?

617
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:24,589
Trying to get off the bottle.

618
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:26,591
Me too. Any luck?

619
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,793
Not yet.

620
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,895
That wine bottle knows
its days are numbered.

621
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:46,844
Sit. Get Zen.

622
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:50,081
I don't know if I can.

623
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,651
Every warrior in history
learned how to do it.

624
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:55,199
I bet plenty of them were hot messes.

625
00:33:58,023 --> 00:33:59,257
We can do this.

626
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:06,931
<i>Julia.</i>

627
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,755
Not so dead, am I?

628
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:06,023
Nothing was wasted, Julia.

629
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:08,059
Ever.

630
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,095
Everything has served
to pull you closer to me.

631
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:17,201
Find me...

632
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:19,670
near the bridge.

633
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:23,775
There's a man who has
served me 1,000 years.

634
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,644
Bring him three gifts.

635
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:29,814
He'll show you the way.

636
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:32,884
Then I will come to you,

637
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,652
my beautiful daughter.

638
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,796
Holy shit.

639
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:47,031
That was a definite wobble, right?

640
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:50,971
- Hey.
- Hey.

641
00:35:52,474 --> 00:35:54,575
I brought this for you
in case you want it.

642
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,545
Not yet.

643
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:08,889
You really want to--

644
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:14,461
Stop.

645
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:50,464
It's been 3 1/2 hours.

646
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:52,132
We're late.

647
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,500
It was worth it.

648
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,206
To being bosses.

649
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,148
Ha.

650
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:10,317
Okay.

651
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:20,594
Remember that spring

652
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,965
at the foot
of the mountains in Fillory?

653
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,601
It was Chatwin's Torrent.

654
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:30,304
Thought you didn't
remember the books.

655
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:31,705
Rupert was wounded, right?

656
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,776
Till the spring healed his leg?

657
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,012
Do you think it's real?

658
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:39,847
Some of the good parts have to be.

659
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,851
At least I hope so.

660
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:47,955
Why?

661
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:50,190
Because I probably have liver damage.

662
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:57,197
On that note, we're out of wine.

663
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:04,204
On that note,
we're out of wine.

664
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,076
Fine, I'll go.

665
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,722
Jesus, you two.

666
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,036
- Ahh!
- I'm sorry.

667
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:37,404
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

668
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:41,675
Um, thanks for
reminding me it's there.

669
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,713
Uh, okay, it's your turn.

670
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:46,981
You can do it.

671
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,457
We are going to Fillory.

672
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:03,097
Oh, my God.

673
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:07,201
You're Toto, and you are Dorothy.

674
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:08,268
Yeah.

675
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:11,972
And I'm flying Muppets.

676
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,707
- One step.
- Meerkats.

677
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:15,709
- Two step.
- No, wait.

678
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,810
That's not it.

679
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:26,987
And I think he passed out.

680
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:32,026
Finally.

681
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:39,967
You know he was--he was
talking about Chatwin's Torrent.

682
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:43,837
Let's be honest.

683
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,207
There's a lot more wrong
with Eliot than a broken leg.

684
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:57,284
Yeah, but the spring

685
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:01,522
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

686
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,757
It healed him.

687
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,293
All of him.

688
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:09,930
There's this thing about you, Q.

689
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:11,965
You actually believe in magic.

690
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:17,638
- So does everyone.
- No.

691
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,040
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

692
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,546
And you just love it,
pure and simple.

693
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,389
You know, I've never loved
something like that.

694
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:40,661
That's not true.

695
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,835
Maybe Fillory can fix him.

696
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:54,174
'Cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

697
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:05,886
It's okay.

698
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,223
We're gonna do whatever we can.

699
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:11,258
I promise.
