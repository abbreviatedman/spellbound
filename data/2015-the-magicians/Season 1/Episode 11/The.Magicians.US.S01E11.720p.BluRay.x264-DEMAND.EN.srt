4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,524

a preliminary exam</i>

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,682
<i>for entry into

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,922
Regrettably,
you failed the written exam.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,526
Can I start over?

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,206
There's this voice. Everyone
else comes with a lot of static,

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,965
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,128

I was getting duped.

I need to talk to you about Joe.

16

Joe? Oh! I love Joe.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,288
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,725
How can I help?

in there about The Beast?

MARGO: Go back to the part where you
literally popped in on them banging.

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,571
We were casting a spell.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,005
No judgment.

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,687
Saved your life.

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,730
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

37
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,086
It sounds like if
we could find it,

38
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,366
we could use it
to kill The Beast.

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,640
El! Jesus!

40
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,521
It's 11:00
in the morning.

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,926
I'm listening.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,209
So, Martin's
desperate 'cause the Plover

43
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,924
figured out a way
to change physically,

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,446
which opened up a whole
new <i>class</i> of spellwork,

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,967
which meant that, pretty soon, he'd be
able to follow Martin into Fillory.

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,164
Yeah, so Martin got a line on
an enchanted knife, the Leo.

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,241
Uh...

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,323
Yeah, "powerful enough to tear
through the fabric of magic itself."

49
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,606
Like kill a God,

50
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,322
so qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,129
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,611
Fucking love that guy.

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,523
Yeah, so Martin tracked down
the knife maker,

54
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,649
asked him if he could make
him one, and the guy said,

55
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,651
uh...

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,487
"Yeah, I can."

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,721
And then what?

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,086
Uh, well, that's the
end of the pages.

59
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,241
Yeah, nothing happened.

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,326
If Martin killed The Beast, would
we be here now talking about him?

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,402
Yeah, but here's the thing.

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,769
"So, little did Martin know, he
would fail to recover the blade,

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,490
"which would remain
hidden for decades,"

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,042
which means it could still be
sitting somewhere waiting for us.

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,365
Right, in Fillory,
the place where The Beast is.

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,564
Ergo, fuck that.

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,721
Hey.

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,609
Here's a crazy idea.

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,889
Plover wants the button back. Why
don't we just give it to him?

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,088
I don't think
that's a very good plan.

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,286
That's a monumentally
shitty plan.

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,447
ELIOT: I don't know.

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,171
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,011
So, what if we
hand them the button,

75
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,525
thereby giving
The Beast what he wants,

76
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,409
thereby rendering
ourselves harmless,

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,720
thereby he leaves us alone.

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,531
Right 'cause handing the key to the
multiverse to a monster is a really...

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,840
That's a good idea, Eliot.

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,763
Beats getting vivisected.
Speak for yourself.

81
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,371
If his whole
hard-on's locking down travel

82
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,044
to Fillory so he
keeps it all to himself,

83
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,281
I'm still a problem.

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,206
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,601
The rest of us do
not have that luxury,

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,803
so let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea out of bed.

87
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,927
Okay, stop.

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,570

What if it works?

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,401
Then it works. The Beast
leaves us alone. Great.

never get to go to Fillory.

that we'd never dream of.

way to contact them again

in the hierarchy,

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,441

when gods and humans
were on speaking terms.

want to use us.

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,566
Look, you're right.

175
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,042
Most of them know nothing other than
hunger, thirst, and how to hide,

176
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,885
but it's a food chain.
We start at the bottom.

177
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,123
We work our way up till we find
someone who can help us get to them.

178
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,200
How long have
you been at this?

179
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,841
Awhile.

180
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,926
I won't lie. You know,
it's been tough going.

181
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,644
Bender, show them.

182
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,766
Mostly bloodsuckers,
useless junkies,

183
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,531
but sometimes you can get
a lead onto something else.

184
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,490
After they talk your ear
off for, like, 12 hours.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,001
(CHUCKLES)

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,084
Those leads
admittedly keep petering out,

187
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,767
but I think we have
an ace up our sleeve now.

188
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,521
Julia.

189
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,761
What?

190
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,364
That prayer I gave you, you know,
doesn't work for everyone.

191
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,926
Actually, you're the first.

192
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,407
I don't understand...

193
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,447
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

194
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,965
but I gave you a test.

195
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,687
Why?

196
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,891
I'm not religious.
I'm not anything.

197
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,126
We don't know why some
people are god-touched.

198
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,690
There's no rhyme or reason.

199
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,091
Karma, DNA,
luck of the draw.

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,521
But it's you, Julia.

201
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,044
I think if we send you on the hunt,
we're gonna get some results.

202
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,601
(SCOFFS)

203
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,010
I don't know.
Penny was pretty clear.

204
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
What are we planning?

205
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,968
Nothing yet. Just discussing how
we're all probably gonna die

206
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,644
before we even set
foot in Fillory because

207
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,007
the Neitherlands are
full of mercenaries.

208
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,491
Sounds like a problem.

209
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,642
Point is, we need some
serious battle magic.

210
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,846
But that stuff's illegal.

211
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,004
I'm fucking with you.
I'm in.

212
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,804
I'm in, too.
I heard the word "illegal."

213
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,970
Oh, Alice, there's a note for you
from admin. I see you've got a call.

214
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,606
Mom, please, just calm down.
I can't understand you.

215
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,726
You what?

216
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,606
I'm so sorry.

217
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,682
I have to go. I'll call
you <i>as</i> soon as I can.

218
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,367
It's Joe.

219
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,006
He killed himself.

220
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,761
What?

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,080
I have to talk to Penny.

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,964
My mom <i>says he was hearing voices,
and it was getting worse,</i>

223
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,964
and that the voices
were threatening him.

224
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,090
He's a Traveler. He was a
Traveler, and I just thought...

225
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,571
I know what
happened to her friend.

226
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,402
It's The Beast.
Shit.

227
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,443
I got it under control.

228
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,726
Penny, maybe you
should think about

229
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,643
the possibility that
he's targeting you guys.

230
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,246
I mean, you're like
a walking button...

231
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,526
Think you're
telling me anything new?

232
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,245
Sorry. I should go. I...

233
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,810
Penny, where are
you gonna go?

234
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,567
We can find
a way to help you.

235
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,290
I'm sorry. I've got
to talk to someone.

236
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,764
PENNY: Stanley, man,
you there?

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,686
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

238
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,841
You been hearing him, too?

239
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,123
He knows everything
there is about me.

240
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,370
My son's home address, describes
my granddaughter's every freckle.

241
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,090
Look, man, he's targeting us

242
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,448
because we can hear him,
because we can travel.

243
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,763
I mean, he wants all the roads in
and out of his fortress on lock.

244
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,046
No shit.

245
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,603
Like I want to
travel to a blue state.

246
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,642
Never mind other worlds.

247
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,361
What do we do?

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,641
I got a plan, and there's
nothing he can do to stop me.

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,723
Yeah? What's the plan?

250
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,604
Watch and trust me.

251
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,882
This removes all his leverage.

252
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,841
He can't make me
do a damn thing.

253
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,200
Where did you get this? ls
this, like, from World War ll?

254
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,445
I tripped and fell on it locked in
a drawer in Sunderland's office.

255
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,921
My Japanese is a little rusty,
but I think that this says

256
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,248
Magic <i>Misairu</i>

257
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,086
Magic missile?

258
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,166
That's like straight-up
Dungeons <i>&</i> Dragons- Oh. Okay.

259
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,241
Uh...

260
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,445
Do you want to...
Okay. Move.

261
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,851
Your Popper 43 is off.

262
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,561
Huh?

263
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,850
What if we got guns?
QUENTIN: What?

264
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,924
No! No, look, this is
basic Prime Directive.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,244
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society. You can't...

266
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,405
Yes, very pristine. It's been taken
over by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

267
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,403
Yeah, and that's
not Fillory's fault.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,889
Great. Let's go native.

269
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,089
Scale of one to 10, how are you
with a broadsword, Quentin?

270
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,366
This should've worked.

271
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,646
Could of, should of,
would of.

272
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,200
I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

273
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,327
One time or another.

274
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,767
Eliot, you...

Twisted Mike's
neck like a doll?

276
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,129
Yeah, and it was
shockingly easy.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,685
I don't have
an explainer for you.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,048
Yeah, and it just
sort of came puking out.

279
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,241
Well, where did you learn it?

280
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,971
I know who we
need to talk to.

No. Whatever it is,
just no.

Penny, please. I know, but
this is really that important.

288
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,161
It feels jacked to be doing a
mirror spell in here, seriously.

289
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,242
Just focus.
It's not working!

290
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,125
Because she's a good Magician, and
she doesn't want to be found.

291
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,967
Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but...

292
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,530
The reflection's changing.

293
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,006
You're welcome.

294
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,127
Penny!

295
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
Come with us!

296
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,051
I know this place.

297
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,762
That's Julia's apartment.

298
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,280

299
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,161

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,607
Could we come in?

303
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,370
Julia's not here. She won't
be back for a couple hours.

304
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,727
Yeah, we're here to
talk to you, actually.

I think that's
an insanely stupid idea.

309

You don't just go fight
someone stronger on his turf.

310
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,489
We know.
We have a plan for The Beast.

311
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,925
We just need to make
sure we have enough

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,889
under our belt to
even make it to him.

313
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,201
Let's just say
you're very likely

314
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,884
to be mugged in
the Neitherlands.

315
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,804
I'm sorry.
I can't teach it to you.

316
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,803
Look, most people can't do battle
magic, except in crazy spurts.

317
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,767
Like "baby trapped
under a car" type shit.

318
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,490
But you can do it on cue.

319
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,324
Yeah, 'cause I
studied it for years.

And spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.

Great. So we're stuck
with our dicks in our hands.

wouldn't recommend it.

of your business.

just admit that

have a real family.
