1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,449
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,830
<i>- Okay, what is this place?
- Brakebills University.</i>

3
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:07,700
<i>You've been offered
a preliminary exam</i>

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,799
<i>for entry into
the graduate program.</i>

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,490
Regrettably,
you failed the written exam.

6
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:15,056
- Can I start over?
- There's this voice.

7
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:16,726
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

8
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:19,234
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

9
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,266
- You're hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

10
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,006
I'm Stanley.

11
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,337
I'm your mentor.
Travelers are rare.

12
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:26,942
- Where are we?
- The Neitherlands.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,682
The place between
all other places.

14
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:30,009
My friend's life is in danger,

15
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,784
and I need to talk
to you about Joe.

16
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:35,182
Joe?
Oh, I love Joe.

17
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:37,416
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

18
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,221
How can I help?

19
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:42,061
We are pushing the boundaries
of what is magically possible.

20
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:44,359
We are the best
Magicians we know.

21
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,031
<i>Silver can literally
fly to the moon</i>

22
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>but Mennoly is dying.</i>

23
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,795
<i>Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.</i>

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,100
- You're trying to...
- Summon a god.

25
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:53,937
Oh!

26
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,898
I'm a member of The Order,
the keepers

27
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,436
of the libraries
of the Neitherlands,

28
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,041
the greatest repository
of knowledge.

29
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,612
- Here it is.
- Wait, Martin?

30
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:01,811
That's... okay, is there

31
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,682
anything in there
about The Beast?

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,388
Go back to the part
where you literally

33
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:12,117
popped in on them banging.

34
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:13,790
We were casting a spell.

35
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,626
- No judgment.
- We saved your life.

36
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,657
All right, so there might
be a solution here.

37
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,996
Uh, a weapon.

38
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,227
It sounds like if
we could find it,

39
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:23,232
we could use it
to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:26,302
El! Jesus!

41
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:28,338
It's 11:00 in the morning.

42
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,969
I'm listening.

43
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:33,243
So Martin's desperate,
'cause the Plover had

44
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,013
figured out a way
to change physically,

45
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,282
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

46
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:39,451
which meant
that pretty soon he'd be able

47
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:41,080
to follow Martin into Fillory.

48
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,845
Yeah.

49
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:48,289
So Martin got a line
on an enchanted knife, the Leo.

50
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,126
Uh...

51
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,857
Yeah, powerful enough to tear

52
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,702
through the fabric of
magic itself... like, kill a god.

53
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:59,468
So qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

54
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,270
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

55
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,839
I fucking love that guy.

56
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,508
Yeah, so Martin
tracked down the knife maker,

57
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,638
asked him if he could
make him one,

58
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:08,378
and the guy said,

59
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,379
uh...

60
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,116
"Yeah, I can."

61
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:14,647
And then what?

62
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:17,152
Uh, well, that's the end
of the pages.

63
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,392
Yeah, nothing happened.

64
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,689
If Martin killed The Beast,

65
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,360
would we be here now
talking about him?

66
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,288
Yeah, but here's the thing.

67
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:25,862
So little did Martin know

68
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:28,063
he would fail
to recover the blade,

69
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,695
which would remain hidden
for decades,

70
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,570
which means it could still
be sitting somewhere

71
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,169
waiting for us.

72
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,039
Right, in Fillory.

73
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,708
The place where The Beast is.

74
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,709
Ergo, fuck that.

75
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,648
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

76
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,479
Plover wants the button back?

77
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,084
Why don't we just
give it to him?

78
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,986
I... I don't think
that's a very good plan.

79
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:52,818
No, that's
a monumentally shitty plan.

80
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,357
I don't know.

81
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,388
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

82
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,062
So what if we hand them
the button,

83
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,563
thereby giving The Beast
what he wants,

84
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,434
thereby rendering
ourselves harmless,

85
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,333
thereby he leaves us alone?

86
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,165
Right, 'cause handing the key
to the multiverse to a monster

87
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,900
is a really...
that's a good idea, Eliot.

88
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,735
- Beats getting vivisected.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

89
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,871
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel to Fillory

90
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,536
so he keeps it all to himself,
I'm still a problem.

91
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:19,406
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

92
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,716
The rest of us do not
have that luxury.

93
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,189
So let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea

94
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,618
out of bed.

95
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,023
Okay, stop.

96
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,292
This affects all of us.

97
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,533
So those in favor
of striking a deal.

98
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:42,304
Sorry. It's the right move.

99
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:49,477
Because you still seem,
I don't know, gloomy about it.

100
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I can't believe you're not.
Penny's been gone for a week.

101
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,652
Which is like an hour
in the Neitherlands, right?

102
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:56,819
It means nothing.
What if it works?

103
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,450
Then it works.
The Beast leaves us alone, great.

104
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:02,224
You're just upset 'cause
you may never get to go to Fillory.

105
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,726
No, that would be stupid.

106
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,398
- Quentin.
- Why would I want to go?

107
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,797
The child-molesting demon

108
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:08,828
who incidentally wrote
my favorite books

109
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,002
is there waiting to kill us.

110
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,035
Come on. We're late for P.A.

111
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,248
No!

112
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,929
Please, wake up!

113
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,966
Margo, how did this happen?

114
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:47,537
We should have listened
to you, Q.

115
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,702
You think you're hiding,
don't you?

116
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,331
Sleep tight, Quentin Coldwater.

117
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,359
No way in hell we're doing
that fucking spell again.

118
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,566
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little shaky.

119
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,036
I don't like dying.

120
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:31,137
- No kidding.
- You are Margo.

121
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,909
You are fabulous.

122
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,446
You are under the influence
of a probability spell.

123
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:39,377
I am fabulous, aren't I?

124
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:42,383
- Yeah.
- What happened to you?

125
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,116
Beast ripped my head off
in the Neitherlands.

126
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:47,492
So much for negotiating
my freedom.

127
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,091
All right, well,
this was a dead end.

128
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,563
Well, I hate to say
I told you so,

129
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:53,092
but... you know what?

130
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,956
Actually, I don't.
I don't.

131
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,465
I don't hate that.

132
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,728
This is the last one.

133
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,496
- It's dead.
- Ugh.

134
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,065
We're not learning anything new.

135
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:06,609
In every scenario,
The Beast comes next week.

136
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,278
There was one time
we didn't all die...

137
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,509
when we went to Fillory.

138
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,114
No. Everything went white.

139
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,175
It's not necessarily better.

140
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,622
Well, I agree with Quentin.

141
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,449
Oh, that's because he blows you.

142
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,288
Seriously, eight tries.

143
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,419
We get seven deaths,
one mysterious?

144
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:23,655
I... give me that.

145
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,460
I don't think
that we have a choice.

146
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:28,497
No, I'm choosing to
get the fuck away from all of you.

147
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,676
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

148
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,807
<i>Been a while.</i>

149
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,553
<i>Do say you missed me a little.</i>

150
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,450
Fuck you.

151
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,286
<i>Let me cut to the chase.</i>

152
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:52,347
<i>You will deliver yourself to me.</i>

153
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:55,116
<i>Do it now, or do it
when you've gone so mad</i>

154
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,955
<i>you have nothing left,</i>

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,700
<i>because I'm going to make it
very, very loud.</i>

156
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,903
Here's the deal: people used
to petition gods all the time

157
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,338
to bestow power to work stuff

158
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,639
that we'd never dream of.

159
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:14,041
Now, they're it...
biggest source there is.

160
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:17,980
At least they were,
question being...

161
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,551
Where the hell are they now?

162
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:20,750
Exactly.

163
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,652
No one's spoken to a god in centuries.
They disappeared.

164
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,985
Um, I believe that
we can find a way

165
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,692
to contact them again to get
the kind of help they used to give.

166
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,864
- It's time, Richard.
- Contact how?

167
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,925
Humans aren't
their only children;

168
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,068
there are others

169
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:42,599
who are older
and might know more.

170
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,106
Magical creatures.

171
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,178
You mean like vampires
and unicorns?

172
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,679
Uh, I think unicorns are a myth.

173
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:53,182
But yes.

174
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:55,453
Find something high up enough
in the hierarchy,

175
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,590
they might actually remember
when gods and humans

176
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,018
were on speaking terms.

177
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,792
And there's
a huge cross-section of them

178
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,191
right here in the city.

179
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,761
Yeah, because
they want to use us.

180
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:04,890
Look, you're right.

181
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,185
Most of them know nothing other

182
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,296
than hunger, thirst,
and how to hide,

183
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,598
but it's a food chain,
all right?

184
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,101
We start at the bottom;
we work our way up

185
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:16,202
till we find someone
who can help us get to them.

186
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,906
How long have you been at this?

187
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:20,076
A while.

188
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:21,577
I won't lie.

189
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,308
You know, it's been tough going.

190
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,614
Bender, show them.

191
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:31,120
Mostly bloodsuckers,
useless junkies,

192
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:34,090
but sometimes you can get
a lead on to something else.

193
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,731
After they talk your ear off
for, like, 12 hours.

194
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,328
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

195
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,031
but I think we have an ace
up our sleeve now.

196
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,739
- Julia.
- What?

197
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,770
That prayer I gave you,
you know,

198
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,105
doesn't work for everyone.

199
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,941
Actually, you're the first.

200
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,446
I don't understand.

201
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,007
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

202
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,016
but I gave you a test.

203
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,249
Why? I'm not religious.

204
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,755
I'm not a... I'm not anything.

205
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:11,327
We don't know
why some people are god-touched.

206
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,258
All right? There's
no rhyme or reason.

207
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:16,298
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

208
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,199
But it's you, Julia.

209
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,171
I think if we send you
on the hunt,

210
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,942
we're gonna get some results.

211
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,210
I don't know.
Penny was pretty clear.

212
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,175
- What are we planning?
- Nothing yet.

213
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:37,215
Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

214
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,950
before we even
set foot in Fillory

215
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:41,785
because the Neitherlands
are full of mercenaries.

216
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,322
Sounds like a problem.

217
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,326
Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.

218
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,528
But that stuff's illegal.

219
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:50,631
I'm fucking with you.
I'm in.

220
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,134
I'm in too.

221
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,135
I heard the word "illegal."

222
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,967
Oh, Alice, there's a note
for you from admin.

223
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,613
I see you've got a call.

224
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,979
Mom, please, just calm down.

225
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,580
I can't understand you.

226
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:10,047
You what?

227
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:13,189
I'm so sorry.

228
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,391
I have to go.
I'll call you as soon as I can.

229
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,363
It's Joe.

230
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:25,095
He killed himself.

231
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,802
- What?
- I have to talk to Penny.

232
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,512
My mom says
he was hearing voices

233
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,613
and always getting worse

234
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,546
and that the voices
were threatening him.

235
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,653
He's a traveler... he was
a traveler... and I just thought...

236
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,285
I know what happened
to her friend.

237
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,396
It's The Beast.

238
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,227
Shit.

239
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,933
Yeah, I got it under control.

240
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,874
Penny, maybe you should think
about the possibility

241
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,637
that he's targeting you guys.

242
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,038
I mean, you're
like a walking button.

243
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,709
Think you're
telling me anything new?

244
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,947
Sorry, I... I should go.

245
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,448
Penny, where are you gonna go?

246
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,051
We can find a way to help you.

247
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,852
I'm sorry.
I got to talk to someone.

248
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:29,455
<i>Stanley, man, you there?</i>

249
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,496
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

250
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,737
You been hearing him too?

251
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:37,738
He knows everything there is
about me...

252
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,771
my son's home address,

253
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:42,306
describes my granddaughter's
every freckle.

254
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,912
Look, man, he's targeting us

255
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,952
because we can hear him,
because we can travel.

256
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,580
I mean, he wants all the roads

257
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,485
in and out of his fortress
on lock.

258
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:51,917
No shit.

259
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:56,292
Like I want to travel
to a blue state,

260
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:59,028
never mind other worlds.

261
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,696
What do we do?

262
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,457
I got a plan,

263
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,625
and there's nothing
he can do to stop me.

264
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,936
Yeah? Well, what's the plan?

265
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:11,337
Watch... and trust me.

266
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:14,009
This removes all his leverage.

267
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,280
He can't make me do
a damn thing.

268
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,250
Uh, where did you get this?

269
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:26,815
Is this, like,
from World War II?

270
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,493
I tripped and fell on it
locked in a drawer

271
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:29,660
in Sunderland's office.

272
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:31,229
My Japanese is a little rusty,

273
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,628
but I think that this says,
"Majikku misairu."

274
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,399
"Magic missile"?

275
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,801
That's, like,

276
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,403
straight-up
"Dungeons & Dragons."

277
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,606
Oh, okay.

278
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,407
Uh...

279
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,008
Do you want to... okay.

280
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,410
Move.

281
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,856
Your Popper 43 is off.

282
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:13,995
Huh?

283
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,968
- What if we got guns?
- What? No.

284
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:19,143
No, look,
this is basic prime directive.

285
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:22,942
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society.

286
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,376
- You can't...
- Oh, yes, very pristine.

287
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,820
It's been taken over
by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

288
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:30,177
Yeah, and that's not
Fillory's fault.

289
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:31,946
Great. Let's go native.

290
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,515
Scale of one to ten, how are you
with a broadsword, Quentin?

291
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,745
This should have worked.

292
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,486
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.

293
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,695
I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

294
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:43,866
One time or another.
Eliot, you...

295
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,027
Twisted Mike's neck
like a doll? Yeah.

296
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:47,396
And it was shockingly easy.

297
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:48,973
I don't have
an explainer for you.

298
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:51,472
Yeah, and it just
sort of came puking out.

299
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,743
Well, where'd you learn it?

300
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,144
I know who we need to talk to.

301
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,384
<i>Tonight, or I kill the girl</i>
<i>in the dungeon.</i>

302
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,293
Quentin.

303
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,926
No. Whatever it is, just no.

304
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:16,231
Look, we need your help.

305
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,732
We're trying to locate your ex.

306
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,676
Penny, please.

307
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,837
I know, but this is really
that important.

308
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,578
It feels jacked to be
doing a mirror spell

309
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:37,946
in here, seriously.

310
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,522
- Just focus.
- It's not working!

311
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,861
Because she's a good magician,

312
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:43,926
and she doesn't want
to be found.

313
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,027
Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but...

314
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,459
The reflection's changing.

315
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:08,384
- You're welcome.
- Penny.

316
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,675
Come with us.

317
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,618
I know this place.

318
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:18,055
That's Julia's apartment.

319
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,797
Shit.

320
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:24,933
Okay.

321
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,673
Uh, hi.
Could we come in?

322
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:36,905
Um, Julia's not here.

323
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,651
She won't be back
for a couple hours.

324
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:41,018
Yeah, we're here
to talk to you, actually.

325
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,019
Okay. Um...

326
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:49,318
<i>Please, please,
give him what he wants!</i>

327
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,271
I think that's
an insanely stupid idea.

328
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,775
You don't just go fight
someone stronger on his turf.

329
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,646
We know.
We have a plan for The Beast.

330
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,547
We just need to make sure
we have enough under our belt

331
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,316
to even make it to him.

332
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,377
Let's just say
you're very likely

333
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,316
to be mugged
in the Neitherlands.

334
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,557
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't teach it to you.

335
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,558
Look, most people
can't do battle magic

336
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,728
except in crazy spurts.

337
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,159
Like baby-trapped-under-a-car
type shit.

338
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,865
But you can do it on cue.

339
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,397
Yeah, 'cause
I studied it for years.

340
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,067
Give us the CliffsNotes.

341
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,471
Fine.

342
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,911
Meditate every day
for, like, a decade.

343
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,838
And spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.

344
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,335
Great.

345
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,106
So we're stuck with
our dicks in our hands.

346
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,688
Look, there is
this thing hedges use.

347
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,389
But I really
wouldn't recommend it.

348
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,655
Okay.

349
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,060
Now we're listening.

350
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,104
<i>She bleeds so easily,
poor little thing.</i>

351
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:08,937
Fuck!

352
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:11,238
<i>I barely touched her.</i>

353
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,417
Hey.

354
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,924
Look, um...

355
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:34,062
So...

356
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,733
How is she?
Julia, I mean.

357
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,804
Why do you care after
what she did to you?

358
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,466
Okay.
It's none of your business.

359
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:46,542
You know,
that's not how it works.

360
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,443
Giving a shit about someone
that you give a shit about

361
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:50,484
doesn't just evaporate
the second that they fuck up.

362
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,016
So why don't you just admit that
you want to ask me about Penny?

363
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,489
Okay, fine.

364
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,159
Look, Julia is good.

365
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,060
Great, actually.

366
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,002
Like, we're working on something
that could help a lot of people,

367
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,227
so it's good.

368
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:16,336
Okay, now you... is he okay?

369
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:19,408
Yeah, he's extra broody, but...

370
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,778
you know, it's Penny;
he's fireproof.

371
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,179
He's like cockroaches;
he'll survive the nuclear winter.

372
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,527
<i>You can end it.</i>

373
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,996
<i>Just end it.</i>

374
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,495
Shut up.

375
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:53,976
Shut the hell up.

376
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:55,607
Okay.

377
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,412
Okay, look.

378
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,649
.

379
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,670
You should thank Alice Quinn.

380
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,498
She found you.

381
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:24,973
- Get on with the lecture.
- Oh, I've overdosed once.

382
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,574
No, twice, if you count the time

383
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:30,306
I took so much Prozac,
I developed tardive dyskinesia,

384
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,981
but that was an accident.

385
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:37,319
The crack... that was
a straight OD, no chaser.

386
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,520
You smoked crack?

387
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:42,991
I've done things that would
make you hide under a blankie.

388
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,392
So just tell me
what's happening.

389
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:49,356
A voice from another world
has a thing for travelers.

390
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,995
So it's an assault.

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,230
That's a nice mild term for it.

392
00:20:57,974 --> 00:21:03,512
This goes on the base
of your neck.

393
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:07,749
It blocks the flow
to your head like a dam.

394
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,750
You didn't think
of giving this to me sooner?

395
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:12,521
It's not approved.

396
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,358
It wears down the mind's
own ability to defend itself.

397
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,789
It's just a temporary fix

398
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:20,034
until we can put you
on a stricter regimen.

399
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,897
I don't have time for this.

400
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:27,668
Penny, you will never
have a home.

401
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:32,038
You will never have
a real family.

402
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:37,446
Your gifts will take this
from you over and over.

403
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:42,447
So when someone cares enough
to reach out a hand,

404
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,487
just drop the bullshit attitude

405
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,688
and take what they're offering
while you can.

406
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:53,663
Bottling our emotions,
literally.

407
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,729
Kady says we shouldn't use these

408
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,074
for more than three hours
at a time, right?

409
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:01,598
That it's too hard
on the system,

410
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:04,004
and when the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.

411
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,436
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,341
Don't lean on the bottle.

413
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,943
But meanwhile we get to go
full Spock with battle magic.

414
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:12,906
- I don't like it.
- Um, it's the perfect cheat.

415
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,975
I didn't say
I wasn't gonna do it;

416
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,353
I said I didn't like it.

417
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,015
Wow, you look...

418
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,823
Damn handsome for someone
who just had a heart attack?

419
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:25,555
What can I say?
Genetically blessed.

420
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,830
- What are those?
- What do you care?

421
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,872
I thought you wanted
nothing to do with us.

422
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:34,536
I changed my mind.

423
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:37,837
I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.

424
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,010
That girl
you saw in the dungeon?

425
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:43,211
Yeah, we'll get her out.

426
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,081
Deal.

427
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:51,545
Well, this somehow
doesn't feel like a place

428
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:54,189
where anyone knows anything.

429
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,058
Well, apparently
this guy's old as dirt.

430
00:22:58,194 --> 00:22:59,594
Got to start somewhere.

431
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,459
Who knows.

432
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:17,782
Girls.

433
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:21,045
Agency sent you?

434
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,219
- You Bjorn?
- I asked for blondes.

435
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,389
I heard about you from a girl
who got fired from a blood bank

436
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,758
on 67th about a year ago.

437
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,159
Apparently, she wasn't
stealing for herself.

438
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,496
Tracy sold me out?

439
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,857
What'd you give her?

440
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,865
Honestly, 20 bucks.

441
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,397
So I don't think
that was true love.

442
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:44,372
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- We just have a few questions.

443
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:47,442
- Mm.
- We'll pay.

444
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:50,011
20 whole dollars, rich bitch?

445
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,218
Whose is it?

446
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,493
Mine, so it's
the cleanest thing in this room.

447
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,128
We want to petition a god.

448
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:12,095
Um, a... a god?

449
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:15,937
You mean... you mean like "a god"?

450
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:18,907
Nobody's doing that stuff
anymore, sweetheart.

451
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,938
God's inside you.

452
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:23,783
- Come on, I told you...
- Hey, asked and answered.

453
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:27,079
- Come on. Give me it.
- Give me a name.

454
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,583
Some other thing like you.

455
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:30,384
Hey, that's offensive.

456
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,786
I'm a person.
I'm a person.

457
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:34,618
We're not a club.

458
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,758
They're all horrible.

459
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,259
Pixies are dicks,
the lycans are rapists,

460
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:40,592
and shapeshifters,
they all headed west

461
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:41,896
back in the '50s.

462
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,098
Thank you for
that color commentary.

463
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,730
Do you want this or not?
Give me a name.

464
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,935
Okay, okay. Okay.

465
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:49,167
I got one.

466
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:16,459
Huh. Sort of pretty.

467
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:20,504
This must be what undergoing
the Vulcan ritual of Kolinahr is like.

468
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:22,671
I like your sweater.

469
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,972
Are you saying that to be cruel?

470
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:28,276
No. I like your sweater.

471
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,677
I saw no reason not to share.

472
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:33,848
Well, then.

473
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,179
Shall we go fuck some shit up?

474
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:37,615
- Yes.
- Yes.

475
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,150
Yes, definitely.
Definitely.

476
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:43,888
Just remember,
if this is a Lamia,

477
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:46,793
we're dealing
with a high-level psychic.

478
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,156
Yeah.

479
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,390
What are you saying to me?

480
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:17,826
I'm not saying anything to you.

481
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,387
Who do you think you are?
I just want a quarter.

482
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:24,031
Hey.

483
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,103
- Chickadee.
- Mom?

484
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,372
It's so good to see you.

485
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:33,842
I'm so, so sorry.

486
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:37,646
Baby, I missed you so much.

487
00:26:37,647 --> 00:26:41,816
I need you.

488
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,777
Kady, step back, okay?
It's not your mom.

489
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,346
I'm not an idiot, Julia.

490
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:49,519
Julia...

491
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,725
I forgive you.

492
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:55,797
- I know what you are.
- I'm trying to give you a gift.

493
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,667
Both of you.
You need me.

494
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,068
My mom is dead, bitch.

495
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,899
Drop the act.

496
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,144
If you can read my mind, you
know that we both have knives

497
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:07,008
in our pockets
dipped in gold and silver

498
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,539
and coated in shark's blood.

499
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,975
Jesus, that's overkill.

500
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:15,250
We weren't sure
which legends were true.

501
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,519
I hate Ivy League girls.

502
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,250
Then tell us
what we want to hear,

503
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,655
and I'll get that one
out of your hair.

504
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,387
What?

505
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,192
What do I have for you?

506
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:31,395
Uh, look at this place.
Look at me.

507
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,200
Lamiae were servants of a goddess.

508
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,603
Back before
the birth of fire, maybe.

509
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,265
We want to petition her.

510
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:46,181
Oh. That's so cute.

511
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:47,822
But that's not what you want.

512
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,045
I know what you really want...

513
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:57,115
to be whole...

514
00:27:57,126 --> 00:28:00,026
like you were on that day

515
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:02,129
that you split into two Julias

516
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,600
and you got in that elevator
and lost everything.

517
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,101
Shut up.

518
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,603
- I can give you that.
- Get out of my head.

519
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:11,969
Fine.

520
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:13,408
I'll be blunt.

521
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,939
She's dead.

522
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:19,105
They're all dead.

523
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,915
Call the gods all you want.

524
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:26,048
There's no one to hear you.

525
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:28,955
Let's go.
Come on.

526
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:32,827
Anyway, "God is dead"

527
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,728
seems to be the consensus.

528
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,999
I don't accept that.

529
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,598
Well, Lamia
seemed pretty convinced.

530
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,230
She was a bitter, half-starved
monster living in filth.

531
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,896
The gods have abandoned her.

532
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:44,004
It doesn't mean they're gone.

533
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:47,136
We got another rock
to turn over?

534
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,778
Not yet.

535
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,579
- So then what?
- I don't know, Julia.

536
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:56,151
I mean, what do you want me
to say? "I give up"?

537
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:58,022
"Forget about ever
really fixing anything"?

538
00:28:58,023 --> 00:28:59,820
No, we keep trying, okay?

539
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,322
At least I do.
You do whatever you want.

540
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,193
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

541
00:29:05,194 --> 00:29:06,861
I mean, this is my house.

542
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:17,939
You're bleeding a little.

543
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,510
That explains the burning pain.

544
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:22,613
Is that a traveler thing?

545
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:25,111
It's a hearing voices thing.

546
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:27,684
Well, I guess that beats
whatever you were snorting.

547
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:29,050
Marginally.

548
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,560
That was
an unadulterated success.

549
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,029
Pity we have to put them back.

550
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,896
Agreed.
Feelings are bullshit.

551
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,397
Let's just get this over with.

552
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,999
Right.
Bottoms up.

553
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,576
Whoa.

554
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:37,284
Quentin.
Quentin.

555
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:38,616
You know I love you.

556
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,391
I love you so much.
Like, so much.

557
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:42,357
You know that, right?

558
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:45,058
Yeah, do you know... 'cause
I feel like, uh, I'm kind of,

559
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,228
like, all alone.

560
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,559
Why aren't we friends
anymore, El?

561
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,625
We're best friends.

562
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:56,271
Can we be honest
for five seconds, please?

563
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,806
Honestly...

564
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,507
I'd rather not.

565
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:05,653
You don't care about me.

566
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,020
That is stupid.

567
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:13,922
We are going to Fillory
to save everything.

568
00:31:13,923 --> 00:31:16,291
It'll all be fine, like before,

569
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,992
except even better.

570
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,393
Now catch up.

571
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:23,796
This is Daddy's third drink,
Bambi.

572
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:34,879
Oh my head.

573
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,580
I couldn't even sleep.

574
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,709
They were a bad idea,
the bottles.

575
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:39,783
I hate everything.

576
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:40,882
I hate air right now.

577
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:42,550
You have diagnosed depression.

578
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,851
Shouldn't be bottling you up;
you could...

579
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:45,092
Kill myself?

580
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:48,659
I'm sure Plover
would get to me first.

581
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:53,527
I think we should try mastering it
without the bottles.

582
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:56,129
I'm sure you probably could.

583
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:58,099
I'm talking about all of us.

584
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,500
Not all of us are you, Alice.

585
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,705
Okay.
You're hung over.

586
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:05,906
I don't think you meant that
like it sounded.

587
00:32:05,908 --> 00:32:07,668
I'm sorry. Yes.

588
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,806
I just... I feel like sometimes
you don't hear yourself.

589
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,282
All I said was
that I think we should try...

590
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:15,049
This is what that looks like.

591
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,690
I am trying as hard as I can.

592
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,821
Okay. Uh...

593
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:55,794
If you're not dead,
I'm listening.

594
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:02,557
Whatever... I'm here.

595
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,135
I want to do good.

596
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,743
Please.

597
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:22,116
Hey.

598
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:23,777
Troops coming?

599
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:25,886
Still at the cottage studying.
What are you doing?

600
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,548
Trying to get off the bottle.

601
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:29,556
Me too. Any luck?

602
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,758
Not yet.

603
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,860
That wine bottle knows
its days are numbered.

604
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,808
Sit. Get Zen.

605
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:53,047
I don't know if I can.

606
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:56,617
Every warrior in history
learned how to do it.

607
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,088
I bet plenty of them
were hot messes.

608
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,216
We can do this.

609
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,900
<i>Julia.</i>

610
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:06,718
Not so dead, am I?

611
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:08,990
Nothing was wasted, Julia.

612
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:11,021
Ever.

613
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,056
Everything has served
to pull you closer to me.

614
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:20,168
Find me...

615
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:22,637
near the bridge.

616
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:26,738
There's a man who has
served me 1,000 years.

617
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:29,610
Bring him three gifts.

618
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:32,780
He'll show you the way.

619
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:35,850
Then I will come to you,

620
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:37,851
my beautiful daughter.

621
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,123
Holy shit.

622
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:52,796
That was
a definite wobble, right?

623
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,201
- Hey.
- Hey.

624
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,797
I brought this for you
in case you want it.

625
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,774
Not yet.

626
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,119
You really want to...

627
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,691
Stop.

628
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,661
It's been 3 and a half hours.

629
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,329
We're late.

630
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,730
It was worth it.

631
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:02,436
To being bosses.

632
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:11,342
Ha.

633
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,506
Okay.

634
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,789
Remember that spring

635
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:28,162
at the foot
of the mountains in Fillory?

636
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,798
It was Chatwin's Torrent.

637
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:33,499
Thought you didn't
remember the books.

638
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,932
Rupert was wounded, right?

639
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,973
Till the spring healed his leg?

640
00:37:38,974 --> 00:37:41,208
Do you think it's real?

641
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,079
Some of the good parts
have to be.

642
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:47,084
At least I hope so.

643
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,152
Why?

644
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:53,423
Because I probably
have liver damage.

645
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,429
On that note, we're out of wine.

646
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:07,428
On that note,
we're out of wine.

647
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:12,306
Fine, I'll go.

648
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,950
Jesus, you two.

649
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,229
- Ahh!
- I'm sorry.

650
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,604
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

651
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:44,872
Um, thanks for
reminding me it's there.

652
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:48,909
Uh, okay, it's your turn.

653
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,210
You can do it.

654
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:59,653
We are going to Fillory.

655
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,289
Oh, my God.

656
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:10,398
You're Toto,
and you are Dorothy.

657
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,459
Yeah.

658
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:15,166
And I'm flying Muppets.

659
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,900
- One step.
- Meerkats.

660
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,905
- Two step.
- No, wait.

661
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:20,007
That's not it.

662
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:30,217
And I think he passed out.

663
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:35,258
Finally.

664
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:43,201
You know he was... he was
talking about Chatwin's Torrent.

665
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,033
Let's be honest.

666
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:50,435
There's a lot more wrong
with Eliot than a broken leg.

667
00:39:56,511 --> 00:40:00,481
Yeah, but the spring

668
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,718
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

669
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,949
It healed him.

670
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,485
All of him.

671
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,127
There's this thing about you, Q.

672
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:15,198
You actually believe in magic.

673
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:20,825
- So does everyone.
- No.

674
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,266
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

675
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:28,784
And you just love it,
pure and simple.

676
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:38,622
You know, I've never loved
something like that.

677
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,891
That's not true.

678
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:51,064
Maybe Fillory can fix him.

679
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,396
'Cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

680
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,080
It's okay.

681
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:12,419
We're gonna do whatever we can.

682
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,490
I promise.
