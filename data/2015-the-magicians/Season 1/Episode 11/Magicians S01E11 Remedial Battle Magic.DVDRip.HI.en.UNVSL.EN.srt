00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,503

00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,939
Regrettably, you
failed the written exam.

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,540

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,209
There's this voice. Everyone
else comes with a lot of static,

9
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,082
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

Joe? Oh! I love Joe.

17
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,296
Wait, so you know your
way around the Neitherlands?

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,737
How can I help?

19

in there about The Beast?

you literally popped in on them banging.

33
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,572
We were casting a spell.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,972
No judgment.

35

Saved your life.

36
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,713
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

37
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,124
It sounds like if
we could find it,

38
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,468
we could use it
to kill The Beast.

39
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,619
El! Jesus!

40
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,513
It's 11:00 in the morning.

41
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,950
I'm listening.

42
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,221
So, Martin's desperate
'cause the Plover

43
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,921
figured out a way
to change physically,

44
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,464
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

45
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,968
which meant that, pretty soon, he'd
be able to follow Martin into Fillory.

46
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:48,167
Yeah, so Martin got a line on
an enchanted knife, the Leo.

47
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,241
Uh...

48
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,343
Yeah, "powerful enough to tear
through the fabric of magic itself."

49
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,608
Like kill a God,

50
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:59,346
so qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

51
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,164
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

52
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,588
Fucking love that guy.

53
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,522
Yeah, so Martin tracked
down the knife maker,

54
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,618
asked him if he could make
him one, and the guy said,

55
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,626
uh...

56
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,454
"Yeah, I can."

57
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,699
And then what?

58
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,097
Uh, well, that's the
end of the pages.

59
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,194
Yeah, nothing happened.

60
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,345
If Martin killed The Beast, would
we be here now talking about him?

61
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,400
Yeah, but here's the thing.

62
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,778
"So, little did Martin know, he
would fail to recover the blade,

63
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,476
"which would remain
hidden for decades,"

64
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,042
which means it could still be
sitting somewhere waiting for us.

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,354
Right, in Fillory, the
place where The Beast is.

66
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,595
Ergo, fuck that.

67
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,723
Hey.

68
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,595
Here's a crazy idea.

69
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,898
Plover wants the button back.
Why don't we just give it to him?

70
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,097
I don't think that's
a very good plan.

71
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,348
That's a monumentally
shitty plan.

72
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,431
ELIOT: I don't know.

73
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,202
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

74
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,007
So, what if we hand
them the button,

75
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,556
thereby giving The
Beast what he wants,

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,412
thereby rendering
ourselves harmless,

77
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,745
thereby he leaves us alone.

78
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,596
Right 'cause handing the key to the
multiverse to a monster is a really...

79
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,849
That's a good idea, Eliot.

80
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,787
Beats getting vivisected.
Speak for yourself.

81
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,435
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel

82
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,059
to Fillory so he
keeps it all to himself,

83
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,289
I'm still a problem.

84
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,197
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

85
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,633
The rest of us do
not have that luxury,

86
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,797
so let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea out of bed.

87
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,895
Okay, stop.

What if it works?

95
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,405
Then it works. The Beast
leaves us alone. Great.

may never get to go to Fillory.

to petition gods all the time

stuff that we'd never dream of.

spoken to a god

a way to contact them again

are a myth, but yes.

enough in the hierarchy,

170
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,495

171
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,799
when gods and humans
were on speaking terms.

172
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,391
And there's a huge cross-section
of them right here in the city.

173
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,407

they want to use us.

175
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,080
Most of them know nothing other
than hunger, thirst, and how to hide,

176
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,946
but it's a food chain.
We start at the bottom.

177
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,180
We work our way up till we find
someone who can help us get to them.

178
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,261
How long have you been at this?

179
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,884
A while.

180
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,994
I won't lie. You know,
it's been tough going.

181
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,691
Bender, show them.

182
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,825
Mostly bloodsuckers,
useless junkies,

183
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,566
but sometimes you can get
a lead onto something else.

184
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,541
After they talk your ear
off for, like, 12 hours.

185
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,033
(CHUCKLES)

186
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,103
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

187
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,776
but I think we have an
ace up our sleeve now.

188
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,552
Julia.

189
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,786
What?

190
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,350
That prayer I gave you, you
know, doesn't work for everyone.

191
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,954
Actually, you're the first.

192
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,420
I don't understand...

193
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,540
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

194
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,998
but I gave you a test.

195
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,726
Why?

196
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,934
I'm not religious.
I'm not anything.

197
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,173
We don't know why some
people are god-touched.

198
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,711
There's no rhyme or reason.

199
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,109
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

200
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,542
But it's you, Julia.

201
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,086
I think if we send you on the
hunt, we're gonna get some results.

202
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,623
(SCOFFS)

203
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,021
I don't know. Penny
was pretty clear.

204
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,160
What are we planning?

205
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,001
Nothing yet. Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

206
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,710
before we even set
foot in Fillory because

207
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,071
the Neitherlands are
full of mercenaries.

208
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,507
Sounds like a problem.

209
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,669
Point is, we need some
serious battle magic.

210
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,871
But that stuff's illegal.

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,010
I'm fucking with you. I'm in.

212
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,851
I'm in, too. I heard
the word "illegal."

213
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:58,992
Oh, Alice, there's a note for you
from admin. I see you've got a call.

214
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,630
Mom, please, just calm
down. I can't understand you.

215
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,726
You what?

216
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,630
I'm so sorry.

217
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,700
I have to go. I'll call
you as soon as I can.

218
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,369
It's Joe.

219
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,042
He killed himself.

220
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,808
What?

221
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,080
I have to talk to Penny.

222
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,993
My mom says he was hearing
voices, and it was getting worse,

223
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,994
and that the voices
were threatening him.

224
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,106
He's a Traveler. He was a
Traveler, and I just thought...

225
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,634
I know what
happened to her friend.

226
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,404
It's The Beast. Shit.

227
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,481
I got it under control.

228
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,827
Penny, maybe you
should think about

229
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,683
the possibility that
he's targeting you guys.

230
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,298
I mean, you're like
a walking button...

231
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,762
Think you're telling
me anything new?

232
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,255
Sorry. I should go. I...

233
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,856
Penny, where are you gonna go?

234
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,644
We can find a way to help you.

235
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,296
I'm sorry. I've got
to talk to someone.

236
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,772
PENNY: Stanley, man, you there?

237
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,710
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

238
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,924
You been hearing him, too?

239
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,155
He knows everything
there is about me.

240
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:41,388
My son's home address, describes
my granddaughter's every freckle.

241
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,123
Look, man, he's targeting us

242
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,462
because we can hear
him, because we can travel.

243
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,798
I mean, he wants all the roads
in and out of his fortress on lock.

244
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,064
No shit.

245
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,636
Like I want to
travel to a blue state.

246
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,667
Never mind other worlds.

247
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,371
What do we do?

248
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,677
I got a plan, and there's
nothing he can do to stop me.

249
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,715
Yeah? What's the plan?

250
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,623
Watch and trust me.

251
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,892
This removes all his leverage.

252
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,857
He can't make me
do a damn thing.

253
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,205
Where did you get this? Is
this, like, from World War II?

254
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,471
I tripped and fell on it locked in
a drawer in Sunderland's office.

255
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,977
My Japanese is a little
rusty, but I think that this says

256
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,239
Magic <i>Misairu</i>

257
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,111
Magic missile?

258
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,185
That's like straight-up
<i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i> Oh. Okay.

259
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,289
Uh...

260
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,483
Do you want to... Okay. Move.

261
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,875
Your Popper 43 is off.

262
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,583
Huh?

263
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,880
What if we got guns?
QUENTIN: What?

264
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,948
No! No, look, this is
basic Prime Directive.

265
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,292
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society. You can't...

266
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,459
Yes, very pristine. It's been taken
over by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

267
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,434
Yeah, and that's
not Fillory's fault.

268
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,902
Great. Let's go native.

269
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,135
Scale of one to 10, how are
you with a broadsword, Quentin?

270
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,403
This should've worked.

271
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,676
Could of, should of, would of.

272
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,236
I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

273
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,372
One time or another.

274
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,815
Eliot, you...

275
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,249
Twisted Mike's neck like a doll?

276
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,184
Yeah, and it was
shockingly easy.

277
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,721
I don't have an
explainer for you.

278
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,115
Yeah, and it just sort
of came puking out.

279
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,350
Well, where did you learn it?

280
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,994
I know who we need to talk to.

or I kill the girl in the dungeon.</i>

283
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,606
No. Whatever it is, just no.

00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,005
Look, we need your help.

Penny, please. I know, but
this is really that important.

288
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,246
It feels jacked to be doing a
mirror spell in here, seriously.

289
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,262
Just focus. It's not working!

290
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,137
Because she's a good Magician,
and she doesn't want to be found.

291
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,021
Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but...

292
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,536
The reflection's changing.

293
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,058
You're welcome.

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,156

00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,362
Come with us!

00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,103
I know this place.

297
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,800
That's Julia's apartment.

298
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,309

00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,175

00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,649
Could we come in?

303
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,431
Julia's not here. She won't
be back for a couple hours.

Yeah, we're here to
talk to you, actually.

I think that's an
insanely stupid idea.

309

You don't just go fight
someone stronger on his turf.

310
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,527
We know. We have
a plan for The Beast.

311
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,007
We just need to make
sure we have enough

312
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,897
under our belt to
even make it to him.

313
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,265
Let's just say
you're very likely

314
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,894
to be mugged in
the Neitherlands.

315
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,830
I'm sorry. I can't
teach it to you.

316
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,835
Look, most people can't do
battle magic, except in crazy spurts.

317
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,810
Like "baby trapped
under a car" type shit.

318
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,509
But you can do it on cue.

319
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,313
Yeah, 'cause I
studied it for years.

Fine. Meditate every

And spells only work if
you channel 100% clean.

Great. So we're stuck
with our dicks in our hands.

recommend it.

what she did to you?

of your business.

not how it works.

that you give a shit about

doesn't just evaporate the
second that they fuck up.

00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,348
I've overdosed once.

took so much Prozac,

straight OD, no chaser.

what's happening.

A voice from another world
has a thing for Travelers.

373
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,810
So it's an assault.

It's a nice mild term for it.

It blocks the flow to
your head like a dam.

You didn't think of
giving this to me sooner?

378
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,861
It's not approved.

own ability to defend itself.

can put you on a stricter regimen.

You will never
have a real family.

enough to reach out a hand,

hard on the system,

392
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,754
and when the feelings come
back, it's extremely intense.

lean on the bottle.

seems to be the consensus.

I don't accept that.

511
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,009
Well, the Lamia
seemed pretty convinced.

512
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,713
She was a bitter, half-starved
monster living in filth.

her. It doesn't mean they're gone.

I don't know, Julia.

518
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,701
I mean, what do you want
me to say? "I give up"?

519
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,433
"Forget about ever really fixing
anything"? No, we keep trying, okay?

520
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,270
At least I do. You do
whatever you want.
