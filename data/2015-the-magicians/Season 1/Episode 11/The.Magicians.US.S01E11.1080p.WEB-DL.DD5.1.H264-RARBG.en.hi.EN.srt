4

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,440
- Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

6

- There's this voice.

7

Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,184
but him, he's clear
as a fu**ing bell.

9
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,216
- You're hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

10

11

I'm your mentor.
Travelers are rare.

12
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,892

- The Neitherlands.

all other places.

14
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,959

to you about Joe.

16

29

where you literally

33
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,067
popped in on them banging.

34
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,743

35
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,581
- No judgment.
- We saved your life.

36
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,607
- All right, so there might
be a solution here.

37
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:19,952
Uh, a weapon.

38
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,177
It sounds like if
we could find it,

39
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,182
we could use it
to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,254
- El! Jesus!

41
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,293
It's 11:00 in the morning.

42
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,919
- I'm listening.

43
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,194
- So Martin's desperate,
'cause the Plover had

44
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,964
figured out a way
to change physically,

45
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,232
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

46
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,401
which meant
that pretty soon he'd be able

47
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,030
to follow Martin into Fillory.

48
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,795
- [mumbles]
- Yeah.

49
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,543
So Martin got a line

50
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,239
on an enchanted knife, the Leo.

51
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,082
Uh...

52
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,807
Yeah, powerful enough to tear

53
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,652
through the fabric of
magic itself--like, kill a god.

54
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:59,418
So qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

55
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,220
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

56
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,792
- I fu**ing love that guy.

57
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,460
- Yeah, so Martin
tracked down the knife maker,

58
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,588
asked him if he could
make him one,

59
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,333
and the guy said,

60
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,329
uh...

61
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,071
"Yeah, I can."

62
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,597
- And then what?

63
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,102
- Uh, well, that's the end
of the pages.

64
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,344
- Yeah, nothing happened.

65
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,639
If Martin killed The Beast,

66
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,310
would we be here now
talking about him?

67
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,238
- Yeah, but here's the thing.

68
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,814
So little did Martin know

69
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,013
he would fail
to recover the blade,

70
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,645
which would remain hidden
for decades,

71
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,520
which means it could still
be sitting somewhere

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,119
waiting for us.

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,990
- Right, in Fillory.

74
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,660
The place where The Beast is.

75
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,659
- Ergo, fu** that.

76
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,603
- Hey, here's a crazy idea.

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,429
Plover wants the button back?

78
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,034
Why don't we just
give it to him?

79
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,936
- I--I don't think
that's a very good plan.

80
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,768
- No, that's
a monumentally shitty plan.

81
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,313
- I don't know.

82
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,338
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

83
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,013
So what if we hand them
the button,

84
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,513
thereby giving The Beast
what he wants,

85
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,384
thereby rendering
ourselves harmless,

86
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,283
thereby he leaves us alone?

87
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,115
- Right, 'cause handing the key
to the multiverse to a monster

88
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,850
is a really--
that's a good idea, Eliot.

89
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,685
- Beats getting vivisected.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

90
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,821
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel to Fillory

91
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,486
so he keeps it all to himself,
I'm still a problem.

92
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:19,356
- Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

93
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,666
The rest of us do not
have that luxury.

94
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,139

semi-functional idea

This affects all of us.

98

177
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
- Exactly.

178
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,001
No one's spoken
to a god in centuries.

179
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,602
They disappeared.

180
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,935
Um, I believe that
we can find a way

181
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,140
to contact them again
to get the kind of help

182
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,642
they used to give.

183
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:34,814
- It's time, Richard.
- Contact how?

184
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,875
- Humans aren't
their only children;

185
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,024
there are others

186
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,549
who are older
and might know more.

187
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,056
- Magical creatures.

188
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,130
- You mean like vampires
and unicorns?

189
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,629
- Uh, I think unicorns
are a myth.

190
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,132
But yes.

191
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,403
Find something high up enough
in the hierarchy,

192
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,542
they might actually remember
when gods and humans

193
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,968
were on speaking terms.

194
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,742
- And there's
a huge cross-section of them

195
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,141
right here in the city.

196
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,712
- Yeah, because
they want to use us.

197
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,840
- Look, you're right.

198
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,135
Most of them know nothing other

199
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,246
than hunger, thirst,
and how to hide,

200
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,548
but it's a food chain,
all right?

201
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,051
We start at the bottom;
we work our way up

202
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,152
till we find someone
who can help us get to them.

203
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,856
- How long
have you been at this?

204
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,028
- A while.

205
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,527
I won't lie.

206
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,258
You know,
it's been tough going.

207
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,564
Bender, show them.

208
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,072
- Mostly bloodsuckers,
useless junkies,

209
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,041
but sometimes you can get
a lead on to something else.

210
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,681
- After they talk your ear off
for, like, 12 hours.

211
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,278
- Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

212
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,981
but I think we have an ace
up our sleeve now.

213
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,693
Julia.
- What?

214
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,720
- That prayer I gave you,
you know,

215
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,055
doesn't work for everyone.

216
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,891
Actually, you're the first.

217
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,396
- I don't understand.

218
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,957
- I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

219
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,966
but I gave you a test.

220
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,199
- Why? I'm not religious.

221
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,705
I'm not a--I'm not anything.

222
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,278
- We don't know
why some people are god-touched.

223
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,208
All right? There's
no rhyme or reason.

224
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,253
Karma, DNA,
luck of the draw.

225
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,149
But it's you, Julia.

226
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,122
I think if we send you
on the hunt,

227
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,892
we're gonna get some results.

228
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,520
- [scoffs softly]

229
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,160
- I don't know.
Penny was pretty clear.

230
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,125
- What are we planning?
- Nothing yet.

231
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,165
Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

232
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,900
before we even
set foot in Fillory

233
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,735
because the Neitherlands
are full of mercenaries.

234
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,272
- Sounds like a problem.

235
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,276
- Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.

236
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,478
- But that stuff's illegal.

237
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,581
I'm fu**ing with you.
I'm in.

238
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,084
- I'm in too.

239
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,085
I heard the word "illegal."

240
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,917
Oh, Alice, there's a note
for you from admin.

241
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,563
I see you've got a call.

242
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,929
- Mom, please, just calm down.

243
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,530
I can't understand you.

244
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,997
You what?

245
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,143
I'm so sorry.

246
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,540
I have to go.

247
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,341
I'll call you
as soon as I can.

248
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,313
It's Joe.

249
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,045
He killed himself.

250
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,752
- What?
- I have to talk to Penny.

251
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,463
My mom says
he was hearing voices

252
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,563
and always getting worse

253
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,496
and that the voices
were threatening him.

254
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,603
He's a traveler--he was
a traveler--and I just thought--

255
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,235
- I know what happened
to her friend.

256
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,349
It's The Beast.

257
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,177
- Shit.

258
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,883
- Yeah, I got it under control.

259
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,824
- Penny, maybe you should think
about the possibility

260
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,590
that he's targeting you guys.

261
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,988
I mean, you're
like a walking button.

262
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,659
- Think you're
telling me anything new?

263
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:11,901
Sorry, I--I should go.

264
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,398
- Penny,
where are you gonna go?

265
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,001
We can find a way
to help you.

266
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,802
- I'm sorry.
I got to talk to someone.

267
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,405
<i> [knock at door]</i>
<i> Stanley, man, you there?</i>

268
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,446
- Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

269
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,692
- You been hearing him too?

270
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,688
- He knows everything there is
about me--

271
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,721
my son's home address,

272
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,256
describes my granddaughter's
every freckle.

273
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,862
- Look, man, he's targeting us

274
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,904
because we can hear him,
because we can travel.

275
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,530
I mean, he wants all the roads

276
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,435
in and out of his fortress
on lock.

277
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,867
- No shit.

278
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:56,242
Like I want to travel
to a blue state,

279
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,983
never mind other worlds.

280
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,649
- What do we do?

281
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,407
- I got a plan,

282
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,575
and there's nothing
he can do to stop me.

283
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,894
- Yeah? Well, what's the plan?

284
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:11,287
- Watch...and trust me.

285
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,961
This removes all his leverage.

286
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,230
He can't make me do
a damn thing.

287
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,661
[gunshot]

288
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,200
- Uh, where did you get this?

289
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,765
Is this, like,
from World War II?

290
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,443
- I tripped and fell on it
locked in a drawer

291
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,611
in Sunderland's office.

292
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,179
- My Japanese is a little rusty,

293
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:34,578
but I think that this says,
"Majikku misairu."

294
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,349
- "Magic missile"?

295
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,751
That's, like,

296
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,353
straight-up
"Dungeons & Dragons."

297
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,564
Oh, okay.

298
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,357
Uh...

299
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,958
Do you want to--okay.

300
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
Move.

301
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,806
- Your Popper 43 is off.

302
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,945
Huh?

303
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,494
- What if we got guns?

304
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,918
- What? No.

305
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,093
No, look,
this is basic prime directive.

306
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,892
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society.

307
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,326
You can't--
- Oh, yes, very pristine.

308
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,772
It's been taken over
by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

309
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,127
- Yeah, and that's not
Fillory's fault.

310
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,896
- Great. Let's go native.

311
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,465
Scale of one to ten, how are you
with a broadsword, Quentin?

312
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,665
- This should have worked.

313
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,436
- Coulda,
shoulda, woulda.

314
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,645
- I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

315
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,817
One time or another.
Eliot, you--

316
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,977
- Twisted Mike's neck
like a doll? Yeah.

317
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,346
And it was shockingly easy.

318
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,924
I don't have
an explainer for you.

319
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,422
- Yeah, and it just
sort of came puking out.

320
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,694
- Well, where'd you learn it?

321
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,094
- I know who we need to talk to.

322
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,928
<i> - Tonight, or I kill the girl</i>

323
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,334
<i> in the dungeon.</i>

324
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,243
- Quentin.

325
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,876
- No. Whatever it is, just no.

326
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,183
- Look, we need your help.

327
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,682
We're trying to locate your ex.

328
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,462
- [laughing]

329
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,628
- Penny, please.

330
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,787
I know, but this is really
that important.

331
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,528
- It feels jacked to be
doing a mirror spell

332
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,896
in here, seriously.

333
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,474
- Just focus.
- It's not working!

334
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,813
Because
she's a good magician,

335
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,878
and she doesn't want
to be found.

336
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,977
- Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but--

337
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,409
- The reflection's changing.

338
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,334
- You're welcome.
- Penny.

339
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,625
Come with us.

340
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,568
- I know this place.

341
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,005
That's Julia's apartment.

342
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,747
Shit.

343
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:24,883
Okay.

344
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:25,954
<i> [knocking at door]</i>

345
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,623
Uh, hi.
Could we come in?

346
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,855
- Um, Julia's not here.

347
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,603
She won't be back
for a couple hours.

348
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,968
- Yeah, we're here
to talk to you, actually.

349
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,969
- Okay. Um...

350
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,268
<i> - Please, please,</i>
<i> give him what he wants!</i>

It's not your mom.

I forgive you.

Both of you.
You need me.

- Jesus, that's overkill.

which legends were true.

- I hate Ivy League girls.

542
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,200

out of your hair.

544

Uh, look at this place.
Look at me.

547
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,150
- Lamiae
were servants of a goddess.

548

- Back before
the birth of fire, maybe.

549
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,215
- We want to petition her.

550

551
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,772
But that's not what you want.

554
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,976

556
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:05,551

and lost everything.

558

- Get out of my head.

Come on.

569

- Well, Lamia
seemed pretty convinced.

570
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,180
- She was a bitter, half-starved
monster living in filth.

571
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,846
The gods have abandoned her.

572

It doesn't mean they're gone.

- I don't know, Julia.

No, we keep trying, okay?

At least I do.

I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

706
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:44,822
Um, thanks for
reminding me it's there.

707
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,863
- Uh, okay, it's your turn.

708
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,160
You can do it.

709
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:59,604
- We are going to Fillory.

Oh, my God.

712
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,354
You're Toto,
and you are Dorothy.

713
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,409
- Yeah.

714
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:15,116
- And I'm flying Muppets.

715
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,850
- One step.
- Meerkats.

716
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,855
- Two step.
- No, wait.

717
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,957
That's not it.

718
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,028
[laughter]

[snoring]

720
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,167
- And I think he passed out.

721
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,643
- [sighs]

722
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,208
- Finally.

723
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:43,151
- You know he was--he was
talking about Chatwin's Torrent.

724
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,983
- Let's be honest.

725
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,385
There's a lot more wrong
with Eliot than a broken leg.

726
00:39:56,461 --> 00:40:00,431
- Yeah, but the spring

727
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,672
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

728
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,899
It healed him.

729
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,435
All of him.

730
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:13,081
- There's this thing
about you, Q.

731
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,148
You actually believe in magic.

732
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:20,775
- So does everyone.
- No.

733
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:23,216
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

734
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,734
And you just love it,
pure and simple.

735
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:38,572
You know, I've never loved
something like that.

736
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,841
- That's not true.

737
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,014
- Maybe Fillory can fix him.

738
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,346
'Cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

739
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,030
- It's okay.

740
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,374
We're gonna do whatever we can.

741
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,440
I promise.
