00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,078
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:04,628
<i>This school exists for
a single and timeless purpose:</i>

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,130
<i>to reveal your innate abilities</i>

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,203
<i>and hone them to
the highest degree.</i>

5
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:12,054
Holy shit.
I'm doing this.

6
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:16,637
Quentin Coldwater.

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,043
There you are.

8
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,080
All we can do is...

9
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,854
make them Magicians.

10
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:26,357
That's not enough.

11
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:27,727
Marina didn't betray my mom.

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,363
She cleaned up her mess.

13
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,866
<i>Cut to now Marina has to demand</i>

14
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,004
<i>that I steal shit
ten times a week.</i>

15
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:35,343
Wait, you know who
has a ton of new stuff?

16
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,345
<i>Marina.</i>

17
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,716
Run!

18
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,258
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,098
You are a traveler.

20
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:50,302
<i>It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.</i>

21
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,615
I designed it myself.

22
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,621
<i>Works by binding
your body to Earth.</i>

23
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:00,126
<i>You must bare yourself
in the presence</i>

24
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,130
<i>of another magical adept</i>

25
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,470
<i>and expose your utmost truth.</i>

26
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:06,939
I'm falling in love with you.

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,343
I only flirted with you
that first day

28
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,147
because you looked useful,
and you were.

29
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:13,086
We stole a lot of shit.
So there it is.

30
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,797
It's all a lie.

31
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,829
Hey!

32
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:19,098
Alice, I-

33
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:22,271
ugh!

34
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,235
M.E. thinks it was
some kind of

35
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:12,206
very rare brain hemorrhage.

36
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:13,709
Your friend have a history
of that kind of thing?

37
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,281
She wasn't my friend.

38
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:18,586
Then why are you crying?

39
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,723
I don't know.

40
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,264
Anyway, you're free to go.

41
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,800
Somebody waiting out here
to pick you up.

42
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:29,041
Says she's your sister.

43
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,290
<i>That happened, right?</i>

44
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,298
We flew...

45
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,336
here to Antarctica?

46
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,513
I don't want to lose it-

47
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,250
how it felt.

48
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,156
I-it-
the sky, it, uh-

49
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,628
It's like you could feel it

50
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,202
inside the air.

51
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,239
Part of it-
all of it, like-

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,610
Everything fit...

53
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,882
all by itself.

54
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,241
Penny, can we-

55
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,378
Birds.

56
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,716
I never shit so much in my life.

57
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:26,724
But at least I got
to eat bugs, so...that.

58
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:31,434
Now snow.
God, I hate snow.

59
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,939
Hey, you were told
to report here, right?

60
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,476
By that TA or whatever?

61
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:37,212
Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:41,588
I saw him herd another six
or seven kids into the library.

63
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,627
So what is this then?

64
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,732
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

65
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:51,053
- Who I hear is crazy.
- You heard wrong.

66
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,888
Sit.

67
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,257
I do not ask

68
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:02,330
and I do not order twice.

69
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,425
I hate you.

70
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,369
I hate all of you.

71
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,641
And you know why?

72
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,384
It's the Hammer Charm
of Legrand.

73
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:29,653
We know this.

74
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,557
I hate all of you

75
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,965
because you don't know anything.

76
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,504
You learn magic like

77
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:41,777
parrot learns Shakespeare:
tricks for birdseeds.

78
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:44,349
You are all clever pets.

79
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,553
You.

80
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,692
Sultry-But-Damaged.

81
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:52,198
What is the Hammer Charm
of Legrand?

82
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,770
It's, um-
it's the-

83
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,409
One day your looks
will be gone like that

84
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,582
and unless there's
a brain behind

85
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,790
those batting eyelashes

86
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,062
you will be selling oranges

87
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,400
at an off-ramp.

88
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,471
It's a spell that makes
nails go into boards

89
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,608
perfectly straight.

90
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,022
You think you know
how to do this,

91
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,693
I assure you, you do not.

92
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,323
<i>Ein saat schlug tief-</i>

93
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,092
Your voices are your enemies.

94
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,664
A great Magician-

95
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,169
and as you gaze
into your mirrors

96
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,006
in the coming years,

97
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,678
you may recall that I

98
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:51,219
was the last great Magician
you ever saw,

99
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,563
a great Magician is magic

100
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,333
in his bones,

101
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,004
blood, heart,

102
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,008
and dick.

103
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,014
Or lady parts.
Whatever.

104
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:09,823
Begin.

105
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:35,201
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

106
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,936
Does this say "Ibiza"?

107
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,272
Yes,

108
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,813
but this...

109
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:56,017
screams "Ibiza."

110
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,961
Hey, so Ibiza...

111
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,163
Is a place-

112
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:03,800
That we're going to.

113
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,304
<i>I'm hearing Encanto Octulo
this year</i>

114
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:09,478
is gonna be, like,
off the chain,

115
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,649
but you have to be invited

116
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,153
by people who've been...

117
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:15,557
And you guys have both been.

118
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,163
- Twice.
- Right.

119
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,908
Margo, you look so beautiful.

120
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,611
Uh, I-I can't even-

121
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,916
I got this.

122
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,452
Tell me your name again.

123
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,757
- Todd.
- Todd.

124
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,360
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:37,535
<i>Encanto Oculto
is a solid week of sun,</i>

126
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,539
drugs, and magical art.

127
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,412
Time stops, reality bends,

128
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,316
and you fuck five times a day.

129
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,585
On a bad day.

130
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,388
It sounds awesome.

131
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,125
It is, Todd.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,700
It is awesome, but honestly,

133
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:54,637
you'd end up in a corner alone.

134
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:58,445
Bitter.
Bumming everyone out.

135
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,317
Like last year at the bacchanal.

136
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,190
Poor-
Wait, what was his name?

137
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,294
- Um-
- Hmm.

138
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:08,331
- Todd.
- Todd.

139
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,402
How weird is that?

140
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:14,443
Todd, you don't want to
end up like the other Todd.

141
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,349
What happened to him?

142
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,821
He just wasn't
meant to be there.

143
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:23,729
He moped and whined
and brought everything down.

144
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,200
Okay, we were a little wrecked,

145
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,875
and for fun, someone-

146
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,580
- someone not us...
- No, not us.

147
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:37,141
- Turned Todd into a pig.
- And we ate him.

148
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:43,067
Wait, are you guys
messing with me right now?

149
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,543
Okay.

150
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,014
Well, I'm just gonna...

151
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,153
I'm gonna...

152
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,702
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,373
Okay, focus.

154
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,746
<i>Last thing: the regalo.</i>

155
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,351
The re-what-now?

156
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,587
The gift to the elders

157
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:10,090
footing the bill
for the debauchery.

158
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,495
Right.
What did we get them last year?

159
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,933
An actual, working bag of dicks.

160
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,104
Right.
It was lame.

161
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,410
You got anything?

162
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,745
You?

163
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,616
I wrote something down.

164
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,188
These TA's were whispering,

165
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,962
so I figured it had to be good.

166
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:31,634
They were talking about-yes.

167
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:33,772
"How to make magical gin."

168
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,076
Mmm, gin and tonic.

169
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:37,780
Strong, classic.

170
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:40,118
No one kicks that out
of a party.

171
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,187
Me likey.

172
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,291
Good, but this you hatey.

173
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,961
I only got part of the spell.

174
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,582
We have to dig out the rest
in the library.

175
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:43,502
Why don't you two just fuck?

176
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,414
No?

177
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,953
Then try this:

178
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,890
work!

179
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:05,346
I'm fine, okay

180
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,077
I'm just-

181
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,849
I got hooked up with
some sketchy people,

182
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,622
but I'm fine.
Okay?

183
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:20,736
I'll get to this tomorrow.

184
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,568
Blood's not going to
come out of that sweater.

185
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,570
You should just throw it out.

186
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,341
Okay, thanks...

187
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:34,221
For getting me home.

188
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:35,792
I'll call you.

189
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,494
- I'm staying.
- What?

190
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,000
To make sure you're okay.

191
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,104
You really don't
have to do that, I'm-

192
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:44,910
The blankets still here?

193
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,880
Yup.

194
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:01,510
What is this?

195
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:02,947
It's Arabic.

196
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,817
I flunked Arabic.

197
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,088
I got an A.

198
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,961
Well, partly because I paid
for the exam answers

199
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:13,100
in nipple clamps.

200
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:15,973
Bag Of Dicks is sounding
awful good.

201
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:18,111
Ooh, copy that.

202
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:23,188
Whoa.

203
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,559
She means "Hi."

204
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,363
Are you guys trying
to translate Arabic

205
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,699
because I aced it here?

206
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,235
I mean, it was a couple
years ago, but-

207
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,805
Yeah, mm-hmm.

208
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,910
Cry for help.

209
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,480
Answered.

210
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,827
- Mike.
- Eliot.

211
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,239
Margo.

212
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,830
Yes, yes.

213
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:21,106
By all means,
congratulate yourselves.

214
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,949
You are both such winners.

215
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:02,523
Possibly your first
intelligent communiqué.

216
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:06,865
You should have been
rendered mute long ago.

217
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,070
Now you're probably wondering,

218
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:11,308
"What next?"

219
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:18,105
Bujold's Nail Extraction,
that's what.

220
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,002
- You need help.
- "Help."

221
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,806
You can't keep going like this.

222
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,676
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

223
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,112
Jules.

224
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,816
Please.

225
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,851
This is just like Daddy.

226
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:50,772
Daddy was a drunk.

227
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,358
He was crazy.
I'm not-

228
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,629
James told us he's worried.

229
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,133
James?

230
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,170
Well, let me bring you
up to speed.

231
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:01,543
James doesn't remember me...
at all.

232
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,480
He called last month.

233
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,019
Said the reason you dropped out
was your recovery.

234
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,359
Well, so much
for "anonymous," right?

235
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,401
He cares, Julia.
So do I.

236
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,071
It's why I left eight messages.

237
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:19,002
I mean if I had known
that you were-

238
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,119
Mom knows you got arrested.

239
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,622
She has to keep this
out of the papers.

240
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,192
She just got elected
to the board of the Met

241
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,796
and is trying to close
on a new co-op.

242
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,935
Of course she is.

243
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,404
She said you're gonna
get help, or-

244
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,908
Or what?

245
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,980
You tell her that I'm not Daddy.
I'm not crazy.

246
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:41,425
She's not sticking me someplace
to rot where she stuck him.

247
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:45,065
She's not gonna let go of this.

248
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,072
Well,
I'm sorry, what can she do?

249
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,808
You know, I'm an adult.

250
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,113
Who disappeared,

251
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:55,019
confessed to being on drugs,
got arrested.

252
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,588
You think she doesn't
go to the opera

253
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,592
with ten judges who would
happily commit you?

254
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:02,267
She's Mom.

255
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,071
Fucking bitch.

256
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:07,315
Right down to her lizard pumps.

257
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,584
But I'm not.

258
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,594
I love you

259
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,966
and I can keep her away

260
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,702
and get you help.

261
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:23,343
Just please let me.

262
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:25,614
I called a place.

263
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,439
They can take you tomorrow.

264
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,861
A "place"?

265
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:38,509
You remain because you're best.

266
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,191
***

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,391
You may now speak.

268
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,738
You remain silent?

269
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,476
Perhaps you're teachable
after all.

270
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,913
Good.

271
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:58,086
As that which you
will now learn,

272
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,762
few know
and even fewer understand.

273
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,937
Mind control.

274
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,342
And these...

275
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,941
Are your first subjects.

276
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:17,392
Uh...

277
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,362
isn't that kind of unethical?

278
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,034
I mean, even if they're bugs,
they're alive.

279
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,270
They have free will.

280
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,007
We've been taught not to

281
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,681
try to control living things.

282
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,685
How was your lunch today?

283
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,823
Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no?

284
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,660
And how much free will

285
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:37,599
was exerted by the cow?

286
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:43,244
Mind control
is in everything, everywhere.

287
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,549
We make only one choice:

288
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,054
are you the controller

289
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,858
or controlled?

290
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:03,219
You do not like the moth I see.

291
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,521
Good.

292
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:07,494
That which you hate-

293
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,364
or fear,

294
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:14,007
will motivate you to enslave it.

295
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,579
Ah.

296
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,483
My favorite.

297
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,617
You're psychic?

298
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:41,664
- You're also Traveler?
- Yeah.

299
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:45,438
What idiot marked you there?
Don't tell me.

300
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,311
- A well-meaning educator.
- It's saving my life.

301
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,546
It's chaining you to a rock.

302
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,784
You are free.

303
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:55,158
More free than almost anyone
in this universe

304
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,079
or any other.
Ah.

305
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,539
Where you think
you're sticking that?

306
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,713
They told you not to travel, eh?

307
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:08,017
Too unpredictable,
too hard to control-

308
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,990
Yeah, because it is.
I got zero control.

309
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,860
I don't-I don't even have
a decent sense of direction.

310
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,232
Is like telling eagle

311
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:19,207
to fear heights.

312
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:22,346
I teach you to soar.

313
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:25,686
Yes?

314
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,252
So-so, wait.

315
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,391
So, um-
so, so you know Rick?

316
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:47,662
Oh, my God, Rick is-
is great.

317
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:53,665
This magic gin better make us
see unicorns that fart rainbows.

318
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:57,618
Guys, we have a lot
of work to do here.

319
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,825
Just bang.

320
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,227
Now!

321
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,066
Okay, that was weird.

322
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,535
Describe.

323
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,341
Yeah, I was in
my hometown in-in Florida.

324
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:28,681
Weird. Dull.
Again.

325
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,902
Yes?

326
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,138
Uh, desert.

327
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,707
- Earth?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,779
Maybe Afghanistan.
There were guys with guns.

329
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,217
Um, I think I saw a drone.

330
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:49,023
Again.

331
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:55,770
Fucking volcano!

332
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,005
Jesus.

333
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,190
Which you survived.
Gold star.

334
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:07,560
Well, you seem
to be the only ones

335
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,932
who can't complete the task.

336
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,638
In one case, surprising.

337
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,932
The other...

338
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,829
We try something new.

339
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:28,803
The rings are wired to zap.

340
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,813
Bug flies into ring.

341
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,617
Ah, Jesus.

342
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,488
Your fate is now tied

343
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,460
to the lowest form
of sentient life.

344
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:43,467
I deem that...

345
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,638
appropriate.

346
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,113
Let's just get one.

347
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,850
Okay.

348
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:53,120
Upper left.

349
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:56,026
Okay.

350
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:04,978
Okay.

351
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,558
- It's working.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,328
Okay.

353
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,939
Yes! Yes!

354
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,144
Whoa, I am so-
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

355
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,546
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

356
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,350
It's okay.

357
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,454
Whoa-ow.

358
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,052
Quentin!

359
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,113
I-I-
I don't, um-

360
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:41,034
I'm-I'm-
I'm sorry, really sorry-

361
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:44,141
Jesus.

362
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,675
Is that vodka?

363
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,347
You want me to flunk him

364
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,888
so you can pass this test
with flying colors alone?

365
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,791
No, sir.

366
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:58,202
I tried.

367
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,512
Again.

368
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:05,250
No.

369
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,156
Again.

370
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:13,334

00:37:24,596 --> 00:37:26,786
That's probably true.

555
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:28,503
Have fun.

556
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,840
Todd?

557
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,409
Todd.

558
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:33,146
It's your lucky decade.

559
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:34,716
Pack a swimsuit.

560
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,320
Seriously?

561
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,989
Ground rules:

562
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:39,793
you need to fit in,

563
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,354
so don't talk.

564
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:43,668
Um...

565
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,572
See that she hydrates,

566
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,576
wears sunblock, and waxes.

567
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:51,117
Mama's down south
can get jungly.

568
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:56,176
And you're in charge
of the genie.

569
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,125
Hey.

570
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:20,030
Come back to bed.

571
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:22,068
Be right there...

572
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,527
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

573
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:37,199
Alice, Quentin.

574
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:40,573
I got you both to drop
your fears and inhibitions.

575
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,376
For that you should be
eternally grateful,

576
00:39:42,377 --> 00:39:46,184
but I give you more.

577
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,591
I give you your life's purpose.

578
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,197
Go and live

579
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:56,705
to prove me wrong.

580
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,810
Love each other,

581
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,881
be honest and kind,

582
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:04,087
faithful and happy,

583
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,626
and then,

584
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,197
come back here in 50 years

585
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,636
with your perfect family

586
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:15,444
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

587
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,952
You're welcome.

588
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,322
Quentin...

589
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:23,426
why?

590
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,330
Why the fox?

591
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:29,105
Why not mollusk or firefly?
Why?

592
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,342
The fox knows

593
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:34,716
and I knew...

594
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,321
everything I needed
to survive was me

595
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,991
and it's not just to survive,

596
00:40:38,992 --> 00:40:42,465
but to be happy.

597
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,736
I was...

598
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:46,340
happy.

599
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:49,212
The fox is in you now-

600
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,920
both of you.

601
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:55,058
Feed it.

602
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:03,112
You really are a great teacher.

603
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,414
I know.

604
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:25,843
