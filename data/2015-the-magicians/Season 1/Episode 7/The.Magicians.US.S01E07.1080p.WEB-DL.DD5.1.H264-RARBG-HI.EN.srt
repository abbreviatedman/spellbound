Why the fox?

745
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:30,628
Why not mollusk or firefly?
Why?

746
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,797
The fox knows

747
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:36,098
and I knew...

748
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,769
everything I needed
to survive was me

749
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,500
and it's not just to survive,

750
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,905
but to be happy.

751
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,109
I was...

752
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,778
happy.

753
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,679
The fox is in you now...

754
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:54,452
both of you.

755
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,553
Feed it.
