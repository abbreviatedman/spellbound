about his future as well.

547
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,649
His gifts are a curse.

548
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,243
Without training and practice,

549
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,970
they could kill him.

550
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,564
What am I supposed to do?

551
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,445
What we all do each moment.

552
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,646
Decide.

553
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,321
No.

554
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,283
(WIND HOWLING)

555
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,040
Eliot, come on.

556
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,009
We're gonna miss
the opening orgy.

557
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,764
You're not even dressed.
(SIGHS)

558
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,605
I'm not going.

559
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,966
Fuck.

560
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,044
You're still mad?
No.

561
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,923
I mean, yes,
but that's not why.

562
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,686
I... Mike, lbiza's not
really his thing...

563
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,201
It's ours.
And will be again.

564
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,365
Along with the million other
things that are just us.

565
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,843
I only have one Bambi.

566
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,850
You're gonna miss me so hard,
you won't be able to get it up.

567
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,923
That's probably true.

568
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,401
(SLAPS)

569
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,446
Todd?

570
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,921
Todd.

571
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,770
It's your lucky decade.

572
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,490
Pack a swimsuit.

573
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,925
Seriously?

574
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,850
Ground rules, you need to
fit in, so don't talk.

575
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,961
Um...

576
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,322
See that she hydrates,
wears sunblock, and waxes.

577
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,488
Mama's down south
can get jungly.

578
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,885
And you're in
charge of the genie.

579
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,407
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

(FLUTTERING)

581
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,361
Hey.

582
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,049
Come back to bed.

583
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,443
Be right there.

QUENTIN: Hey, where's Kady?
Who gives a shit?

586
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,244
Alice, Quentin.

587
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,849
I got you both to drop your
fears and inhibitions.

588
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,841
For that you should be eternally
grateful, but I give you more.

589
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,964
I give you your
life's purpose.

590
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,487
Go and live to
prove me wrong.

591
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,450
Love each other,

592
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,324
be honest and kind,

593
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,970
faithful and happy,
and then,

594
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,088
come back here in 50 years
with your perfect family

595
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,323
and gloat over
my frozen corpse.

596
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,850
You're welcome.

597
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,851
Quentin.

598
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,281
Why?

599
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,811
Why the fox?

600
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,527
Why not mollusk
or firefly? Why?

601
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,885
The fox knows

602
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,685
and I knew

603
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,284
everything I needed
to survive was me

604
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,201
and it's not just
to survive,

605
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,964
but to be happy.

606
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,600
I was

607
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,561
happy-

608
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,322
The fox is in you now,

609
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,651
both of you.

610
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,040
Feed it

611
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,130
You really are
a great teacher.

612
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,486
I know.
