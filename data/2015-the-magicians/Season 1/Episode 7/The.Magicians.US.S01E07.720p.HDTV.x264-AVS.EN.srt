00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:02,045
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:04,506
<i>This school exists for
a single and timeless purpose:</i>

3
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:06,093
<i>to reveal your innate abilities</i>

4
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:07,761
<i>and hone them to
the highest degree.</i>

5
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:11,866
Holy shit.
I'm doing this.

6
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:16,622
Quentin Coldwater.

7
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:19,025
There you are.

8
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,027
All we can do is...

9
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:24,830
make them Magicians.

10
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,299
That's not enough.

11
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,667
Marina didn't betray my mom.

12
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:29,302
She cleaned up her mess.

13
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:30,803
<i>Cut to now Marina has to demand</i>

14
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:32,938
<i>that I steal shit
ten times a week.</i>

15
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:35,274
Wait, you know who
has a ton of new stuff?

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,309
<i>Marina.</i>

17
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:38,678
Run!

18
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:43,182
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

19
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:46,052
You are a traveler.

20
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:49,889
<i>It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.</i>

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,560
I designed it myself.

22
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:57,530
<i>Works by binding
your body to Earth.</i>

23
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:00,032
<i>You must bare yourself
in the presence</i>

24
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,034
<i>of another magical adept</i>

25
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:05,404
<i>and expose your utmost truth.</i>

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,839
I'm falling in love with you.

27
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:08,240
I only flirted with you
that first day

28
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,042
because you looked useful,
and you were.

29
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:12,978
We stole a lot of shit.
So there it is.

30
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,680
It's all a lie.

31
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:17,750
Hey!

32
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:19,018
Alice, I--

33
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:22,188
ugh!

34
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,069
M.E. thinks it was
some kind of

35
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:12,037
very rare brain hemorrhage.

36
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,539
Your friend have a history
of that kind of thing?

37
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:16,142
She wasn't my friend.

38
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,411
Then why are you crying?

39
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,579
I don't know.

40
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:24,116
Anyway, you're free to go.

41
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,618
Somebody waiting out here
to pick you up.

42
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,888
Says she's your sister.

43
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,096
<i>That happened, right?</i>

44
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,133
We flew...

45
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,169
here to Antarctica?

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,307
I don't want to lose it--

47
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:50,075
how it felt.

48
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,978
I--it--
the sky, it, uh--

49
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,414
It's like you could feel it

50
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,018
inside the air.

51
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:01,020
Part of it--
all of it, like--

52
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,422
Everything fit...

53
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:05,691
all by itself.

54
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:18,037
Penny, can we--

55
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,172
Birds.

56
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,475
I never shit so much in my life.

57
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,479
But at least I got
to eat bugs, so...that.

58
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:31,217
Now snow.
God, I hate snow.

59
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,686
Hey, you were told
to report here, right?

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,221
By that TA or whatever?

61
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:36,989
Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:41,327
I saw him herd another six
or seven kids into the library.

63
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:44,396
So what is this then?

64
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,465
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,635
- Who I hear is crazy.
- You heard wrong.

66
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,643
Sit.

67
00:03:57,677 --> 00:03:58,978
I do not ask

68
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:02,081
and I do not order twice.

69
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:16,161
I hate you.

70
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:21,100
I hate all of you.

71
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,369
And you know why?

72
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:28,073
It's the Hammer Charm
of Legrand.

73
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,341
We know this.

74
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,277
I hate all of you

75
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:35,681
because you don't know anything.

76
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,217
You learn magic like

77
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:41,453
parrot learns Shakespeare:
tricks for birdseeds.

78
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:44,056
You are all clever pets.

79
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,258
You.

80
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,394
Sultry-But-Damaged.

81
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:51,864
What is the Hammer Charm
of Legrand?

82
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:54,466
It's, um--
it's the--

83
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,069
One day your looks
will be gone like that

84
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:00,239
and unless there's
a brain behind

85
00:05:00,273 --> 00:05:04,476
those batting eyelashes

86
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,712
you will be selling oranges

87
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:09,081
at an off-ramp.

88
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:11,116
It's a spell that makes
nails go into boards

89
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,285
perfectly straight.

90
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,658
You think you know
how to do this,

91
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:22,161
I assure you, you do not.

92
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:25,965
<i>Ein saat schlug tief--</i>

93
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,743
Your voices are your enemies.

94
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:40,312
A great Magician--

95
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,781
and as you gaze
into your mirrors

96
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,617
in the coming years,

97
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,319
you may recall that I

98
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:50,823
was the last great Magician
you ever saw,

99
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:56,195
a great Magician is magic

100
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:57,963
in his bones,

101
00:05:57,998 --> 00:05:59,632
blood, heart,

102
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,634
and dick.

103
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,637
Or lady parts.
Whatever.

104
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:09,441
Begin.

105
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:39,428
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

106
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:48,514
Does this say "Ibiza"?

107
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,848
Yes,

108
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:53,385
but this...

109
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,587
screams "Ibiza."

110
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,526
Hey, so Ibiza...

111
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,694
Is a place--

112
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:03,328
That we're going to.

113
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,831
I'm hearing<i> Encanto Octulo</i>
this year

114
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:09,001
is gonna be, like,
off the chain,

115
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,170
but you have to be invited

116
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:12,671
by people who've been...

117
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,074
And you guys have both been.

118
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,710
- Twice.
- Right.

119
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,415
Margo, you look so beautiful.

120
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,117
Uh, I--I can't even--

121
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,453
I got this.

122
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,954
Tell me your name again.

123
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:31,290
- Todd.
- Todd.

124
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:32,858
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:37,062
<i>Encanto Oculto</i>
is a solid week of sun,

126
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,031
drugs, and magical art.

127
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:41,934
Time stops, reality bends,

128
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,802
and you fuck five times a day.

129
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,070
On a bad day.

130
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:46,872
It sounds awesome.

131
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:48,640
It is, Todd.

132
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:52,211
It is awesome, but honestly,

133
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:54,113
you'd end up in a corner alone.

134
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:57,950
Bitter.
Bumming everyone out.

135
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:00,786
Like last year at the bacchanal.

136
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,655
Poor--
Wait, what was his name?

137
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,791
- Um--
- Hmm.

138
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:07,826
- Todd.
- Todd.

139
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,895
How weird is that?

140
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:13,899
Todd, you don't want to
end up like the other Todd.

141
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,835
What happened to him?

142
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,271
He just wasn't
meant to be there.

143
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:23,175
He moped and whined
and brought everything down.

144
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,644
Okay, we were a little wrecked,

145
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:29,348
and for fun, someone--

146
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:32,017
- someone not us...
- No, not us.

147
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:35,521
- Turned Todd into a pig.
- And we ate him.

148
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,426
Wait, are you guys
messing with me right now?

149
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:45,998
Okay.

150
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,467
Well, I'm just gonna...

151
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,603
I'm gonna...

152
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:59,144
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,813
Okay, focus.

154
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:04,183
Last thing: the<i> regalo.</i>

155
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,785
The re-what-now?

156
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,986
The gift to the elders

157
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,488
footing the bill
for the debauchery.

158
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:11,890
Right.
What did we get them last year?

159
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,326
An actual, working bag of dicks.

160
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,528
Right.
It was lame.

161
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:18,831
You got anything?

162
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,165
You?

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
I wrote something down.

164
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,570
These TA's were whispering,

165
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:28,373
so I figured it had to be good.

166
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:31,009
They were talking about--yes.

167
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,145
"How to make magical gin."

168
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:35,480
Mmm, gin and tonic.

169
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:37,182
Strong, classic.

170
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:39,484
No one kicks that out
of a party.

171
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,586
Me likey.

172
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,654
Good, but this you hatey.

173
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,323
I only got part of the spell.

174
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,259
We have to dig out the rest
in the library.

175
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:42,774
Why don't you two just fuck?

176
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,680
No?

177
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,216
Then try this:

178
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,151
work!

179
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,595
I'm fine, okay

180
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:07,323
I'm just--

181
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,059
I got hooked up with
some sketchy people,

182
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,862
but I'm fine.
Okay?

183
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,969
I'll get to this tomorrow.

184
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,764
Blood's not going to
come out of that sweater.

185
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:24,765
You should just throw it out.

186
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,567
Okay, thanks...

187
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,440
For getting me home.

188
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,975
I'll call you.

189
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,677
- I'm staying.
- What?

190
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,179
To make sure you're okay.

191
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:41,281
You really don't
have to do that, I'm--

192
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:44,118
The blankets still here?

193
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:46,086
Yup.

194
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:00,701
What is this?

195
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,136
It's Arabic.

196
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,004
I flunked Arabic.

197
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,273
I got an A.

198
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,109
Well, partly because I paid
for the exam answers

199
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:12,279
in nipple clamps.

200
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:15,115
Bag Of Dicks is sounding
awful good.

201
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,284
Ooh, copy that.

202
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,356
Whoa.

203
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,725
She means "Hi."

204
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,493
Are you guys trying
to translate Arabic

205
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:27,828
because I aced it here?

206
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:29,363
I mean, it was a couple
years ago, but--

207
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:30,964
Yeah, mm-hmm.

208
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,067
Cry for help.

209
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,635
Answered.

210
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,975
- Mike.
- Eliot.

211
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,381
Margo.

212
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:15,943
Yes, yes.

213
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:20,214
By all means,
congratulate yourselves.

214
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:25,052
You are both such winners.

215
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:01,555
Possibly your first
intelligent communiqué.

216
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,893
You should have been
rendered mute long ago.

217
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,095
Now you're probably wondering,

218
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:10,364
"What next?"

219
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,436
Bujold's Nail Extraction,
that's what.

220
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,993
- You need help.
- "Help."

221
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:41,795
You can't keep going like this.

222
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,664
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

223
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:45,132
Jules.

224
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,834
Please.

225
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:47,835
This is just like Daddy.

226
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,770
Daddy was a drunk.

227
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,338
He was crazy.
I'm not--

228
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:53,607
James told us he's worried.

229
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,142
James?

230
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,144
Well, let me bring you
up to speed.

231
00:15:57,178 --> 00:16:00,514
James doesn't remember me...
at all.

232
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:02,449
He called last month.

233
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,985
Said the reason you dropped out
was your recovery.

234
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:08,322
Well, so much
for "anonymous," right?

235
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:12,392
He cares, Julia.
So do I.

236
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,027
It's why I left eight messages.

237
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,863
I mean if I had known
that you were--

238
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,068
Mom knows you got arrested.

239
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:22,569
She has to keep this
out of the papers.

240
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:24,137
She just got elected
to the board of the Met

241
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:26,740
and is trying to close
on a new co-op.

242
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,909
Of course she is.

243
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:30,344
She said you're gonna
get help, or--

244
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:31,879
Or what?

245
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:34,915
You tell her that I'm not Daddy.
I'm not crazy.

246
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,518
She's not sticking me someplace
to rot where she stuck him.

247
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:44,024
She's not gonna let go of this.

248
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:46,994
Well,
I'm sorry, what can she do?

249
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:48,729
You know, I'm an adult.

250
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,064
Who disappeared,

251
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,934
confessed to being on drugs,
got arrested.

252
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,502
You think she doesn't
go to the opera

253
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,504
with ten judges who would
happily commit you?

254
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:01,208
She's Mom.

255
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,010
Fucking bitch.

256
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,178
Right down to her lizard pumps.

257
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,516
But I'm not.

258
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:14,521
I love you

259
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,857
and I can keep her away

260
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:18,592
and get you help.

261
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:22,262
Just please let me.

262
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:24,531
I called a place.

263
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,566
They can take you tomorrow.

264
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,771
A "place"?

265
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:37,412
You remain because you're best.

266
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,091
***

267
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,288
You may now speak.

268
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,628
You remain silent?

269
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:52,331
Perhaps you're teachable
after all.

270
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,799
Good.

271
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,935
As that which you
will now learn,

272
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,640
few know
and even fewer understand.

273
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,811
Mind control.

274
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:08,213
And these...

275
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,751
Are your first subjects.

276
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,255
Uh...

277
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,190
isn't that kind of unethical?

278
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:20,859
I mean, even if they're bugs,
they're alive.

279
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,094
They have free will.

280
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:23,829
We've been taught not to

281
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:27,532
try to control living things.

282
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,501
How was your lunch today?

283
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:31,637
Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no?

284
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:33,472
And how much free will

285
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:36,441
was exerted by the cow?

286
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:42,047
Mind control
is in everything, everywhere.

287
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,349
We make only one choice:

288
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,885
are you the controller

289
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,687
or controlled?

290
00:18:57,363 --> 00:19:02,034
You do not like the moth I see.

291
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,335
Good.

292
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:06,305
That which you hate--

293
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,173
or fear,

294
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:12,811
will motivate you to enslave it.

295
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,380
Ah.

296
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:17,282
My favorite.

297
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,399
You're psychic?

298
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:40,439
- You're also Traveler?
- Yeah.

299
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:44,176
What idiot marked you there?
Don't tell me.

300
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,045
- A well-meaning educator.
- It's saving my life.

301
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,280
It's chaining you to a rock.

302
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,549
You are free.

303
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,885
More free than almost anyone
in this universe

304
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,821
or any other.
Ah.

305
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,259
Where you think
you're sticking that?

306
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:04,429
They told you not to travel, eh?

307
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,732
Too unpredictable,
too hard to control--

308
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:09,701
Yeah, because it is.
I got zero control.

309
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:11,570
I don't--I don't even have
a decent sense of direction.

310
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,972
Is like telling eagle

311
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,943
to fear heights.

312
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:21,079
I teach you to soar.

313
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,416
Yes?

314
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,965
So--so, wait.

315
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,068
So, um--
so, so you know Rick?

316
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:46,338
Oh, my God, Rick is--
is great.

317
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:50,876
This magic gin better make us
see unicorns that fart rainbows.

318
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:56,281
Guys, we have a lot
of work to do here.

319
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:59,518
Just bang.

320
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,919
Now!

321
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:19,704
Okay, that was weird.

322
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,206
Describe.

323
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,975
Yeah, I was in
my hometown in--in Florida.

324
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,345
Weird. Dull.
Again.

325
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,556
Yes?

326
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,790
Uh, desert.

327
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:40,325
- Earth?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,394
Maybe Afghanistan.
There were guys with guns.

329
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,830
Um, I think I saw a drone.

330
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,666
Again.

331
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,372
Fucking volcano!

332
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:55,640
Jesus.

333
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,810
Which you survived.
Gold star.

334
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,151
Well, you seem
to be the only ones

335
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:08,520
who can't complete the task.

336
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:11,256
In one case, surprising.

337
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,524
The other...

338
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:23,435
We try something new.

339
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:27,405
The rings are wired to zap.

340
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:32,410
Bug flies into ring.

341
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,212
Ah, Jesus.

342
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:36,047
Your fate is now tied

343
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:39,017
to the lowest form
of sentient life.

344
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,053
I deem that...

345
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:44,222
appropriate.

346
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,693
Let's just get one.

347
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:50,428
Okay.

348
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:51,696
Upper left.

349
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:54,599
Okay.

350
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:03,542
Okay.

351
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:10,081
- It's working.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:11,883
Okay.

353
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:17,489
Yes! Yes!

354
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,658
Whoa, I am so--
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

355
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,059
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

356
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:22,894
It's okay.

357
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:24,996
Whoa--ow.

358
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:27,591
Quentin!

359
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,642
I--I--
I don't, um--

360
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,322
I'm--I'm--
I'm sorry, really sorry--

361
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:42,664
Jesus.

362
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:44,166
Is that vodka?

363
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,834
You want me to flunk him

364
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:49,371
so you can pass this test
with flying colors alone?

365
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:51,306
No, sir.

366
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,711
I tried.

367
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:01,016
Again.

368
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,752
No.

369
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:06,655
Again.

370
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:11,827

I didn't want to die

It was Arabic.

451

He said, "Yes, Mistress,
I understand,"

452
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,599
and then something I didn't get,

453
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,235

exactly that to him."

00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,102
That's probably true.

555
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:26,171
Have fun.

556
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:27,506
Todd?

557
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,074
Todd.

558
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:30,776
It's your lucky decade.

559
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,344
Pack a swimsuit.

560
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:33,979
Seriously?

561
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:35,647
Ground rules:

562
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,416
you need to fit in,

563
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,984
so don't talk.

564
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:41,320
Um...

565
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:43,188
See that she hydrates,

566
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,190
wears sunblock, and waxes.

567
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,593
Mama's down south
can get jungly.

568
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:52,798
And you're in charge
of the genie.

569
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:14,680
Hey.

570
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:17,582
Come back to bed.

571
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,618
Be right there...

572
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:32,030
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

573
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,733
Alice, Quentin.

574
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:38,070
I got you both to drop
your fears and inhibitions.

575
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:39,871
For that you should be
eternally grateful,

576
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:43,709
but I give you more.

577
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:47,112
I give you your life's purpose.

578
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:49,715
Go and live

579
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:54,219
to prove me wrong.

580
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:56,321
Love each other,

581
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:58,390
be honest and kind,

582
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:01,593
faithful and happy,

583
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:04,129
and then,

584
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:06,665
come back here in 50 years

585
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:09,101
with your perfect family

586
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:12,938
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

587
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:17,442
You're welcome.

588
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:18,810
Quentin...

589
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,912
why?

590
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,814
Why the fox?

591
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:26,585
Why not mollusk or firefly?
Why?

592
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,820
The fox knows

593
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:32,190
and I knew...

594
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:34,760
everything I needed
to survive was me

595
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:36,428
and it's not just to survive,

596
00:40:36,462 --> 00:40:39,931
but to be happy.

597
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:42,200
I was...

598
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:43,802
happy.

599
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:46,671
The fox is in you now--

600
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:50,375
both of you.

601
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,511
Feed it.

602
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,885
You really are a great teacher.

603
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:03,855
I know.

604
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:27,870
