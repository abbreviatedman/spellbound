00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,766
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,395
<i>This school exists for a
single and timeless purpose,</i>

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,338
<i>to reveal your innate abilities</i>

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,137
<i>and hone them to
the highest degree.</i>

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,944
Holy shit. I'm doing this.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,413
Quentin Coldwater.

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,342
There you are.

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:24,550
All we can do is
make them Magicians.

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,252
That's not enough.

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,659
Marina didn't betray my mom.

11
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,027
She cleaned up her mess.

12
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,697
<i>Cut to now, Marina
gets to demand</i>

13
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,563
<i>that I steal shit
10 times a week.</i>

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,099
But you know who has a
ton of new stuff? Marina.

15
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,498
Run!

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,068
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,612
You are a Traveler.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,612
<i>It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.</i>

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,288
I designed it myself.

20
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,881
<i>It works by binding
your body to Earth.</i>

21
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:02,627
<i>You must bare yourself in the
presence of another magical adept</i>

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,124
<i>and expose your utmost truth.</i>

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,966
I'm falling in love with you.

24
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,245
I flirted with
you that first day

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,813
because you looked
useful, and you were.

26
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,931
We stole a lot of
shit, so there it is.

27
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,273
It's all a lie.

28
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,440
Hey.

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,643
Alice, I...

30
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,289
ME thinks it was some kind
of very rare brain hemorrhage.

31
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,386
Your friend have a
history of that kind of thing?

32
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,368
She wasn't my friend.

33
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,803
Then why are you crying?

34
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,064
I don't know.

35
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,803
Anyway, you're free to go.

36
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,706
Somebody waiting
out here to pick you up.

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,180
Says she's your sister.

38
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,987
<i>That happened, right?</i>

39
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,624
We flew

40
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,022
here to Antarctica?

41
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,895
I don't want to lose it.

42
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,437
How it felt.

43
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,369
I... It... The sky, it...

44
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,167
It's like you could
feel it inside the air.

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
Part of it, all of it, like...

46
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,151
Everything fit all by itself.

47
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,155
Penny, can we...

48
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,722
Birds.

49
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,898
I never shit so much in my life.

50
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,371
But at least I got to
eat bugs, so that...

51
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,342
Now snow. God, I hate snow.

52
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,045
Hey, you were told to report
here, right? By that TA or whatever?

53
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,544
Uh...

54
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,051
Yeah. I saw him herd

55
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,348
another six or seven
kids into the library.

56
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,089
So what is this then?

57
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,255
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

58
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,327
Who I hear is crazy.

59
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,515
You heard wrong.

60
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,561
Sit.

61
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,368
I do not ask and I
do not order twice.

62
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,721
I hate you.

63
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,225
I hate all of you.

64
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,124
And you know why?

65
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,800
It's the Hammer Charm
of Legrand. We know this.

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,932
I hate all of you

67
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,208
because you don't know anything.

68
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,744
You learn magic like
parrot learns Shakespeare,

69
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,142
tricks for birdseeds.

70
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,750
You are all clever pets.

71
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,544
You.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,778
Sultry-But-Damaged.

73
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,186
What is the Hammer
Charm of Legrand?

74
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,320
It's, um... It's the...

75
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,454
One day your looks
will be gone like that

76
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,091
and unless there's
a brain behind

77
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,896
those batting eyelashes

78
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,766
you will be selling
oranges at an off-ramp.

79
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,930
It's a spell that makes
nails go into boards

80
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,412
perfectly straight.

81
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,149
You think you
know how to do this,

82
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,915
I assure you, you do not.

83
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,928
Your voices are your enemies.

84
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,365
A great Magician...

85
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,411
And as you gaze into your
mirrors in the coming years,

86
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,012
you may recall that

87
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,574
I was the last great
Magician you ever saw.

88
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:56,952
A great Magician is magic

89
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,790
in his bones, blood,
heart, and dick.

90
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,598
Or lady parts. Whatever.

91
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,528
Begin.

92
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,306
Does this say, "Ibiza"?

93
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,435
Yes, but this

94
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,478
screams, "Ibiza."

95
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,112
Hey, so Ibiza...

96
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,583
Is a place...

97
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,783
That we're going to.

98
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,155
I'm hearing <i>Encanto
Oculto</i> this year is gonna be,

99
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,422
like, off the chain,

100
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,932
but you have to be invited
by people who've been.

101
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,066
And you guys have both been.

102
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,262
Twice. Right.

103
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,706
Margo, you look so beautiful.

104
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,105
I can't even...

105
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,847
I got this.

106
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,241
Tell me your name again.

107
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,910
Todd. Todd.

108
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,918
Here's the thing.

109
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,685
<i>Encanto Oculto</i> is
a solid week of sun,

110
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,919
drugs, and magical art.

111
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,427
Time stops, reality bends,
and you fuck five times a day.

112
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,031
On a bad day.

113
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,134
It sounds awesome.

114
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,430
It is, Todd.

115
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,696
It is awesome, but honestly,

116
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,304
you'd end up in a corner alone.

117
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,671
Bitter. Bumming everyone out.

118
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,747
Like last year at the bacchanal.

119
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,417
Poor... Wait, what was his name?

120
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,952
Um... Hmm.

121
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,413
Todd. Todd.

122
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,418
How weird is that?

123
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,118
Todd, you don't want to
end up like the other Todd.

124
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,160
What happened to him?

125
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,760
He just wasn't
meant to be there.

126
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,996
He moped and whined and
brought everything down.

127
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:29,935
Okay, we were a little
wrecked, and for fun, someone,

128
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,343
someone not us...

129
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,470
No, not us.

130
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,804
Turned Todd into a pig.

131
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,042
And we ate him.

132
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,046
Wait, are you guys
messing with me right now?

133
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,618
Okay.

134
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,695
Well, I'm just gonna...

135
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,355
I'm gonna...

136
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,498
Oh, my God.

137
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,673
Okay, focus.

138
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,236
Last thing, the <i>regalo.</i>

139
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,473
The re-what now?

140
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,449
The gift to the elders footing
the bill for the debauchery.

141
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,543
Right. What did we
get them last year?

142
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,814
An actual, working bag of dicks.

143
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,880
Right. It was lame.

144
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,383
You got anything?

145
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,120
You?

146
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,019
I wrote something down.

147
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,698
These TA's were whispering,

148
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,291
so I figured it had to be good.

149
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,338
They were talking about...

150
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,873
Yes. "How to make magical gin."

151
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,067
Mmm. Gin and tonic.

152
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,906
Strong, classic.

153
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,247
No one kicks
that out of a party.

154
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,674
Me likey.

155
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,512
Good, but this you hatey.

156
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,074
I only got part of the spell.

157
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,882
We have to dig out
the rest in the library.

158
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,501
Why don't you two just fuck?

159
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,098
No?

160
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,367
Then try this,

161
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,338
work!

162
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,958
I'm fine, okay?

163
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,584
I'm just...

164
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:13,394
I got hooked up with some
sketchy people, but I'm fine.

165
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,833
Okay?

166
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,166
I'll get to this tomorrow.

167
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,187
Blood's not going to
come out of that sweater.

168
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,355
You should just throw it out.

169
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,745
Okay, thanks.

170
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,382
For getting me home.

171
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,618
I'll call you.

172
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,780
I'm staying. What?

173
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,589
To make sure you're okay.

174
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,253
You really don't
have to do that, I'm...

175
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,321
The blankets still here?

176
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,759
Yup.

177
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,240
What is this?

178
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,578
It's Arabic.

179
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,948
I flunked Arabic.

180
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,186
I got an A.

181
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,450
Well, partly because I paid for

182
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,718
the exam answers
in nipple clamps.

183
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,491
Bag of dicks is
sounding awful good.

184
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,629
Copy that.

185
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,167
Whoa.

186
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,299
She means "Hi."

187
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,397
Are you guys trying
to translate Arabic?

188
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,270
Because I aced it here.

189
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,619
I mean, it was a
couple years ago, but...

190
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,872
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

191
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,539
Cry for help.

192
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,880
Answered.

193
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,212
Mike.

194
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,221
Eliot.

195
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,455
Margo.

196
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,317
Yes, yes.

197
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:21,394
By all means,
congratulate yourselves.

198
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,291
You are both such winners.

199
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,396
Possibly your first
intelligent communique.

200
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,997
You should have been
rendered mute long ago.

201
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,037
Now you're probably
wondering, "What next?"

202
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,017
Bujold's Nail
Extraction, that's what.

203
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,398
You need help. "Help."

204
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,100
You can't keep going like this.

205
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,820
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

206
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,177
Jules. Please.

207
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,677
This is just like Daddy.

208
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,876
Daddy was a drunk.

209
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,711
He was crazy. I'm not.

210
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,276
James told us he's worried.

211
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,387
James?

212
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,355
Well, let me bring
you up to speed.

213
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,958
James doesn't
remember me at all.

214
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,390
He called last month.

215
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,655
Said the reason you dropped
out was your recovery.

216
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,334
Well, so much for
anonymous, right?

217
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,200
He cares, Julia. So do I.

218
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,533
It's why I left eight messages.

219
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,128
I mean, if I had
known that you were...

220
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,804
Mom knows you got arrested.

221
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,959
She has to keep
this out of the papers.

222
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,713
She just got elected
to the board of the Met

223
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,447
and is trying to
close on a new co-op.

224
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,583
Of course she is.

225
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,700
She said you're
gonna get help, or...

226
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,783
Or what?

227
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,622
You tell her that I'm
not Daddy. I'm not crazy.

228
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,696
She's not sticking me someplace
to rot where she stuck him.

229
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,295
She's not gonna let go of this.

230
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,098
Well, I'm sorry,
what can she do?

231
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,532
You know, I'm an adult.

232
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,405
Who disappeared,

233
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,606
confessed to being
on drugs, got arrested.

234
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,840
You think she
doesn't go to the opera

235
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,782
with 10 judges who
would happily commit you?

236
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,910
She's Mom.

237
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,951
Fucking bitch.

238
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,057
Right down to her lizard pumps.

239
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,128
But I'm not.

240
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,732
I love you

241
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,731
and I can keep her away

242
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,065
and get you help.

243
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,037
Just please let me.

244
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,139
I called a place.

245
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,378
They can take you tomorrow.

246
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,649
A "place"?

247
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,925
You remain because you passed.

248
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,154
Barely.

249
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,457
You may now speak.

250
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,863
You remain silent?

251
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,706
Perhaps you're
teachable after all.

252
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,466
Good.

253
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,972
As that which
you will now learn,

254
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:03,475
few know and even
fewer understand.

255
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,681
Mind control.

256
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,153
And these

257
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,027
are your first subjects.

258
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,861
Uh...

259
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,632
Isn't that kind of unethical?

260
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,192
I mean, even if they're
bugs, they're alive.

261
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,700
They have free will.

262
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,365
We've been taught not to
try to control living things.

263
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,377
How was your lunch today?

264
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,606
Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no?

265
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,446
And how much free will
was exerted by the cow?

266
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,613
Mind control is in
everything, everywhere.

267
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,851
We make only one choice,

268
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:50,029
are you the controller
or controlled?

269
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,565
You do not like the moth, I see.

270
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,900
Good.

271
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,446
That which you hate or fear,

272
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,745
will motivate you to enslave it.

273
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,654
Ah.

274
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,756
My favorite.

275
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,698
You're psychic?

276
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,442
You're also Traveler?

277
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,147
Yeah.

278
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,546
What idiot marked
you there? Don't tell me.

279
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,344
A well-meaning educator.

280
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,547
It's saving my life.

281
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,420
It's chaining you to
a rock. You are free.

282
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:56,886
More free than almost anyone
in this universe or any other. Ah.

283
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,361
Where you think
you're sticking that?

284
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,804
They told you not to travel, eh?

285
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,366
Too unpredictable,
too hard to control...

286
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,966
Yeah, because it is.

287
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,437
I got zero control.

288
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,342
I don't even have a
decent sense of direction.

289
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,313
Is like telling eagle

290
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,675
to fear heights.

291
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,119
I teach you to soar.

292
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,883
Yes?

293
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,174
So... So, wait. Um...

294
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,574
So you know Rick?

295
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,837
Oh, my God, Rick is great.

296
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,146
This magic gin better make us
see unicorns that fart rainbows.

297
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,950
Guys, we have a
lot of work to do here.

298
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,815
Just bang.

299
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,519
Now!

300
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,138
Okay, that was weird.

301
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,213
Describe.

302
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,076
Yeah, I was in my
hometown in Florida.

303
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:29,147
Weird. Dull. Again.

304
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,099
Yes? Uh, desert.

305
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,795
Earth? Yeah.

306
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,035
Maybe Afghanistan.
There were guys with guns.

307
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,633
I think I saw a drone.

308
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,667
Again.

309
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,947
Fucking volcano!

310
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,108
Jesus.

311
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,585
Which you survived. Gold star.

312
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,794
Well, you seem to be the only
ones who can't complete the task.

313
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,765
In one case, surprising.

314
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,991
The other...

315
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,600
We try something new.

316
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,279
The rings are wired to zap.

317
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,275
Bug flies into ring.

318
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,078
Jesus.

319
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:40,286
Your fate is now tied to the
lowest form of sentient life.

320
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,495
I deem that appropriate.

321
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,301
Let's just get one.

322
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,805
Okay. Upper left.

323
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,770
Okay.

324
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,224
It's working. Yeah.

325
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,451
Okay.

326
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,655
Yes! Yes!

327
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,633
Whoa, I am so... Oh,
my God, I'm so sorry.

328
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,635
It's okay. It's okay. Sorry.

329
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,732
Whoa. Ah.

330
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,966
Quentin!

331
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,543
I don't...

332
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,678
I'm sorry, really sorry.

333
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,915
Jesus.

334
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,556
Is that vodka?

335
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,490
You want me to flunk him
so you can pass this test

336
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,052
with flying colors alone?

337
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,496
No, sir.

338
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,266
I tried.

339
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,634
Again.

340
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:04,836
No.

341
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,907
Again.

342
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,411
Yes! Yeah!

343
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,381
Oh, my God.

344
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,888
Where's the joy?

345
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,357
The fun?

346
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,193
Why are you both determined
to be so fucking bland?

347
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,494
Wait, are you flunking us?

348
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,801
Sadly, I cannot.

349
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,544
Rest. Eat.

350
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,241
Meet me in the entry at 5:00.

351
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,778
I almost, uh...

352
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,215
I almost died today

353
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,424
and I realized I didn't want
to die without knowing, so...

354
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,789
If you feel like
telling me, I'm here.

355
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,493
I don't have to
tell you anything.

356
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,569
I just have to drop my wards.

357
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,739
Let you in.

358
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,545
You can see everything.

359
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,915
Come on in.

360
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,469
Your mom.

361
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,909
Jesus, she...

362
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,177
And she's the only person
you love in the world.

363
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,276
Not anymore.

364
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,938
Oh!

365
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,370
I'm thinking.

366
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,240
You're too pretty.

367
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,354
Okay, listen, listen. What?

368
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,620
What if this Marina?

369
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,149
Okay, what if she got this...

370
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,751
What if she got
some serious shit?

371
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,031
I mean, like, really dope,
one-of-a-kind magic.

372
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,198
Maybe it'd buy
you out. For good.

373
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,171
It'd have to be pretty amazing.

374
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,571
It is.

375
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,472
I've seen it.

376
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,878
Where?

377
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,644
Mayakovsky's office.

378
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,519
I'd just like to point
out that for the record,

379
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,855
you guys basically did
nothing except each other.

380
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,426
Todd was more helpful than you.

381
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,959
Don't. I'm just
using you for effect.

382
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,059
You're right, Margo. I'm sorry.

383
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,500
Listen, I really hope we get a
chance to get to know each other.

384
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,508
We'll give it a
whirl after Ibiza.

385
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,076
Maybe.

386
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,908
Enough, ladies.

387
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,773
Shall we magic some gin? Please.

388
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,724
Well, that was underwhelming.

389
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,869
Oh, yeah, smart guy?

390
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,436
Todd, ice, olives, stat!

391
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,150
Oh, no.

392
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,152
Oh, shit.

393
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,351
Not gin,

394
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,590
g-i-n.

395
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,589
This summons a djinn.

396
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,786
D-j-i-n-n.

397
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,823
A genie? Cool.

398
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,491
Shut up, Todd.

399
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,064
Wait, this could be great.

400
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,109
I mean, if he grants
wishes for real,

401
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,269
and we bring him
to Ibiza, I mean,

402
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,213
that's a fuckin' <i>regalo!</i>

403
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,314
Okay, this genie
totally gets me.

404
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,090
Whoa!

405
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,866
The fuck?

406
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,533
Remove your clothes.

407
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,983
Oh, come on.

408
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,348
You think this is the
worst it can be for you?

409
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,822
Do it.

410
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,938
Being out there
without fur... It's brutal.

411
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,711
With fur... It's nice.

412
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,105
Uh...

413
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,136
This isn't gonna
be weird, is it?

414
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,802
It doesn't have to be.

415
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,284
How am I supposed to
know? This was your idea.

416
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,693
The genie looked at
you. He was talking to you.

417
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,173
I don't even know what he said.

418
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,324
It was Arabic.

419
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,331
He said, "Yes,
Mistress, I understand,"

420
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,266
and then something I didn't get,

421
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,066
and then, "I will do
exactly that to him."

422
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,831
To him. To Mike.

423
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,734
What did you tell him to do?

424
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,867
You were right there.

425
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,277
- I didn't say a word.
- You didn't have to.

426
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,279
You uncorked him. He
could read your thoughts.

427
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,515
That is fucking rude.

428
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,285
God damn it, Margo.

429
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,978
Okay, just...

430
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,418
Nothing bad.

431
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,851
I just wanted Mike to go
back to where he came from.

432
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,693
What does that even mean?

433
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:42,064
It would be the place where
you first saw him, maybe?

434
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,838
Let's go.

435
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,732
Oh, okay.

436
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,278
You wished my boyfriend away.

437
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,985
Boyfriend? He's a random cock.

438
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,552
You are unbelievable sometimes.

439
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,851
Other people aren't
supposed to get between us.

440
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,082
He didn't get between us.

441
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,921
I want him with us, maybe.

442
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,751
But... What's so
special about him?

443
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,690
Really?

444
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,966
What makes him more
interesting than the last 10?

445
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,398
Uh, guys?

446
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,199
Mike?

447
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,701
Jesus.

448
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,169
Get up.

449
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,009
What the actual...

450
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,114
Whoa.

451
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,213
He'll only listen to you.

452
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,479
Stop.

453
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,455
Whoa.

454
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,748
Put him back, Margo.

455
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,153
You don't have to
say anything. Just...

456
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,355
Fine. Shit.

457
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,463
Ugh.

458
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,808
Huh.

459
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,605
Oh, God. Shh.

460
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,313
Okay, baby, come here.

461
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,312
I don't get this part.

462
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,277
My full wish, that Mike would
go back to where he came from

463
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,877
and suck on some other knob.

464
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,987
So literal.

465
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,159
Swag.

466
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,591
Good enough to trade
you out of Marina's hold?

467
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,033
Small enough for bird flight.

468
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,769
I'll go mix some
paste for the spell.

469
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,307
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

470
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:34,871
Go.

471
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:10,011
Your mental wards
are quite strong,

472
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,242
Sultry-But-Damaged.

473
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,548
I couldn't read anything until
you dropped them for Penny.

474
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,850
Then I saw it all.

475
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,919
You have suffered
much for your mother.

476
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,397
And I'm afraid it's not over.

477
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,364
Your mother is dead.

478
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,343
A spell of some kind gone wrong.

479
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,847
I only learned yesterday
through the school

480
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,785
and only just now realized
who she was to you.

481
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,524
How it all fit together.

482
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,758
You are now free of Marina.

483
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,359
But also

484
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,370
they know everything
at Brakebills.

485
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,904
Who you are, what you've done.

486
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,372
You cannot go back.

487
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,639
I was forced.

488
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,672
Brakebills is not
a forgiving place.

489
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,946
You deserve better

490
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,581
than their punishment,
which would be

491
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,757
extreme.

492
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,953
You're planning to
fly tonight with Penny.

493
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,667
You need to think
about his future as well.

494
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,733
His gifts are a curse.

495
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,335
Without training and practice,

496
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,067
they could kill him.

497
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,637
What am I supposed to do?

498
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,543
What we all do each moment.

499
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,744
Decide.

500
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,423
No.

501
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,133
Eliot, come on.

502
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,106
We're gonna miss
the opening orgy.

503
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,834
You're not even dressed.

504
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,671
I'm not going.

505
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,044
Fuck.

506
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,145
You're still mad? No.

507
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,021
I mean, yes, but that's not why.

508
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:07,786
I... Mike, Ibiza's
not really his thing...

509
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,293
It's ours. And will be again.

510
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,465
Along with the million
other things that are just us.

511
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,939
I only have one Bambi.

512
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,944
You're gonna miss me so hard,
you won't be able to get it up.

513
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,012
That's probably true.

514
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,544
Todd?

515
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,016
Todd.

516
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,852
It's your lucky decade.

517
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,588
Pack a swimsuit.

518
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,020
Seriously?

519
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,956
Ground rules, you need
to fit in, so don't talk.

520
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,061
Um...

521
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,397
See that she hydrates,
wears sunblock, and waxes.

522
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,570
Mama's down
south can get jungly.

523
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,998
And you're in
charge of the genie.

524
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,448
Hey.

525
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,123
Come back to bed.

526
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,558
Be right there.

527
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,502
Hey, where's Kady?
Who gives a shit?

528
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,336
Alice, Quentin.

529
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,938
I got you both to drop
your fears and inhibitions.

530
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,945
For that you should be eternally
grateful, but I give you more.

531
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,056
I give you your life's purpose.

532
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:56,559
Go and live to prove me wrong.

533
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,523
Love each other,

534
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,395
be honest and kind,

535
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,029
faithful and happy, and then,

536
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:13,171
come back here in 50
years with your perfect family

537
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,408
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

538
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,908
You're welcome.

539
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,951
Quentin.

540
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,380
Why?

541
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,890
Why the fox?

542
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,591
Why not mollusk or firefly? Why?

543
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,987
The fox knows

544
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,799
and I knew

545
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,364
everything I needed
to survive was me

546
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,266
and it's not just to survive,

547
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,032
but to be happy.

548
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,704
I was

549
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,672
happy.

550
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,408
The fox is in you now,

551
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,749
both of you.

552
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,115
Feed it.

553
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,219
