545
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,876
You're planning to
fly tonight with Penny.

546
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,558
You need to think
about his future as well.

547
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,637
His gifts are a curse.

548
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,232
Without training and practice,

549
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,958
they could kill him.

550
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,553
What am I supposed to do?

551
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,433
What we all do each moment.

552
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,635
Decide.

553
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,310
No.

554
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,272
(WIND HOWLING)

555
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,029
Eliot, come on.

556
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,997
We're gonna miss
the opening orgy.

557
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,753
You're not even dressed.
(SIGHS)

558
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,593
I'm not going.

559
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,955
Fuck.

560
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,033
You're still mad?
No.

561
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,911
I mean, yes,
but that's not why.

562
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,675
I... Mike, lbiza's not
really his thing...

563
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,189
It's ours.
And will be again.

564
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,354
Along with the million
other things that
are just us.

565
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,831
I only have one Bambi.

566
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,838
You're gonna miss me
so hard, you won't be
able to get it up.

567
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,911
That's probably true.

568
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,390
(SLAPS)

569
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,434
Todd?

570
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,910
Todd.

571
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,759
It's your lucky decade.

572
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,479
Pack a swimsuit.

573
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,914
Seriously?

574
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,838
Ground rules,
you need to fit in,
so don't talk.

575
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,950
Um...

576
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,311
See that she hydrates,
wears sunblock,
and waxes.

577
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,477
Mama's down south
can getjungly.

578
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,873
And you're in
charge of the genie.

579
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,395

(FLUTTERING)

581
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,349
Hey-

582
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,037
Come back to bed.

583
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,432
Be right there.

QUENTIN: Hey, where's Kady?
Who gives a shit?

586
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,233
Alice, Quentin.

587
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,838
I got you both to
drop your fears
and inhibitions.

588
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,829
For that you should
be eternally grateful,
but I give you more.

589
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,952
I give you your
life's purpose.

590
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,476
Go and live to
prove me wrong.

591
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,438
Love each other,

592
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,312
be honest and kind,

593
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,959
faithful and happy,
and then,

594
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,076
come back here in 50 years
with your perfect family

595
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,312
and gloat over
my frozen corpse.

596
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,839
You're welcome.

597
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,840
Quentin.

598
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,270
Why?

599
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,799
Why the fox?

600
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,515
Why not mollusk
or firefly? Why?

601
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,873
The fox knows

602
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,674
and I knew

603
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,272
everything I needed
to survive was me

604
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,190
and it's not just
to survive,

605
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,953
but to be happy.

606
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,589
I was

607
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,549
happy-

608
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,310
The fox is in you now,

609
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,639
both of you.

610
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,029
Feedit

611
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,119
You really are
a great teacher.

612
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,474
I know.
