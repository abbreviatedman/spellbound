00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:04,137
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:05,698
<i>This school exists for
a single and timeless purpose:</i>

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,306
<i>to reveal your innate abilities</i>

4
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:09,038
<i>and hone them to
the highest degree.</i>

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,146
Holy shit.
I'm doing this.

6
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,417
Quentin Coldwater.

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,718
There you are.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
All we can do is...

9
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,522
make them Magicians.

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,126
That's not enough.

11
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,388
Marina didn't betray my mom.

12
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,126
She cleaned up her mess.

13
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>Cut to now Marina has to demand</i>

14
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,632
<i>that I steal shit
ten times a week.</i>

15
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,104
Wait, you know who
has a ton of new stuff?

16
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:37,117
<i>Marina.</i>

17
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,406
Run!

18
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,805
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

19
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,711
You are a traveler.

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:50,583
<i>It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.</i>

21
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,321
I designed it myself.

22
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,291
<i>Works by binding
your body to Earth.</i>

23
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,762
<i>You must bare yourself
in the presence</i>

24
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:02,761
<i>of another magical adept</i>

25
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:06,266
<i>and expose your utmost truth.</i>

26
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,567
I'm falling in love with you.

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,098
I only flirted with you
that first day

28
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,743
because you looked useful,
and you were.

29
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:13,668
We stole a lot of shit.
So there it is.

30
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,442
It's all a lie.

31
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,508
Hey!

32
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,712
Alice, I...

33
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,849
ugh!

34
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,797
M.E. thinks it was
some kind of

35
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,758
very rare brain hemorrhage.

36
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,366
Your friend have a history
of that kind of thing?

37
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,836
She wasn't my friend.

38
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,267
Then why are you crying?

39
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,407
I don't know.

40
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,838
Anyway, you're free to go.

41
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,445
Somebody waiting out here
to pick you up.

42
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,647
Says she's your sister.

43
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,790
<i>That happened, right?</i>

44
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,828
We flew...

45
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,829
here to Antarctica?

46
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,169
I don't want to lose it...

47
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,770
how it felt.

48
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,706
I... it...
the sky, it, uh...

49
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,237
It's like you could feel it

50
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,712
inside the air.

51
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,781
Part of it...
all of it, like...

52
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,317
Everything fit...

53
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,518
all by itself.

54
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,757
Penny, can we...

55
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,866
Birds.

56
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,298
I never shit so much in my life.

57
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:27,307
But at least I got
to eat bugs, so... that.

58
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:31,908
Now snow.
God, I hate snow.

59
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,482
Hey, you were told
to report here, right?

60
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:35,911
By that TA or whatever?

61
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,716
Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,988
I saw him herd another six
or seven kids into the library.

63
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,258
So what is this then?

64
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,329
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

65
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,458
- Who I hear is crazy.
- You heard wrong.

66
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,438
Sit.

67
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,706
I do not ask

68
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,837
and I do not order twice.

69
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,885
I hate you.

70
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,859
I hate all of you.

71
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,262
And you know why?

72
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,828
It's the
Hammer Charm of Legrand.

73
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,036
We know this.

74
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,997
I hate all of you

75
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:36,506
because you don't know anything.

76
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,910
You learn magic like

77
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,312
parrot learns Shakespeare:
tricks for birdseeds.

78
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,776
You are all clever pets.

79
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,945
You.

80
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,054
Sultry-But-Damaged.

81
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,616
What is the Hammer Charm
of Legrand?

82
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,326
It's, um...
it's the...

83
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,799
One day your looks
will be gone like that

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,998
and unless there's
a brain behind

85
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:05,371
those batting eyelashes

86
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,572
you will be selling oranges

87
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,876
at an off-ramp.

88
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,877
It's a spell that makes
nails go into boards

89
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,009
perfectly straight.

90
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,485
You think you know
how to do this,

91
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,887
I assure you, you do not.

92
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,732
<i>Ein saat schlug tief...</i>

93
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,569
Your voices are your enemies.

94
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,007
A great Magician...

95
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,608
and as you gaze
into your mirrors

96
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,478
in the coming years,

97
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,009
you may recall that I

98
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,615
was the last great Magician
you ever saw,

99
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:56,918
a great Magician is magic

100
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,664
in his bones,

101
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,494
blood, heart,

102
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,494
and dick.

103
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,496
Or lady parts.
Whatever.

104
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,136
Begin.

105
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:49,172
Does this say "Ibiza"?

106
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,636
Yes,

107
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:54,080
but this...

108
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,449
screams "Ibiza."

109
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,446
Hey, so Ibiza...

110
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:02,585
Is a place...

111
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,089
That we're going to.

112
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,691
I'm hearing <i>Encanto Octulo</i>
this year

113
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,829
is gonna be, like,
off the chain,

114
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,960
but you have to be invited

115
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,565
by people who've been...

116
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,897
And you guys have both been.

117
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,603
- Twice.
- Right.

118
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,135
Margo, you look so beautiful.

119
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,884
Uh, I... I can't even...

120
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:28,147
I got this.

121
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,748
Tell me your name again.

122
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,018
- Todd.
- Todd.

123
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,686
Here's the thing.

124
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,857
<i>Encanto Oculto</i>
is a solid week of sun,

125
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,826
drugs, and magical art.

126
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,757
Time stops, reality bends,

127
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,633
and you fu** five times a day.

128
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:45,861
On a bad day.

129
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,696
It sounds awesome.

130
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,501
It is, Todd.

131
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,972
It is awesome, but honestly,

132
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,913
you'd end up in a corner alone.

133
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:58,778
Bitter.
Bumming everyone out.

134
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,679
Like last year at the bacchanal.

135
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,582
Poor...
Wait, what was his name?

136
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,645
- Um...
- Hmm.

137
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,688
- Todd.
- Todd.

138
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,756
How weird is that?

139
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,757
Todd, you don't want to
end up like the other Todd.

140
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,697
What happened to him?

141
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,028
He just wasn't
meant to be there.

142
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,970
He moped and whined
and brought everything down.

143
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,539
Okay, we were a little wrecked,

144
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,109
and for fun, someone...

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,840
someone not us...
- No, not us.

146
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,246
- Turned Todd into a pig.
- And we ate him.

147
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,188
Wait, are you guys
messing with me right now?

148
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,826
Okay.

149
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,157
Well, I'm just gonna...

150
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:52,298
I'm gonna...

151
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:59,972
Oh, my God.

152
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,707
Okay, focus.

153
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,008
Last thing: the <i>regalo.</i>

154
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,680
The re-what-now?

155
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,848
The gift to the elders

156
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,249
footing the bill
for the debauchery.

157
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,780
Right.
What did we get them last year?

158
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,116
An actual, working bag of dicks.

159
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,290
Right.
It was lame.

160
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,721
You got anything?

161
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,986
You?

162
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,864
I wrote something down.

163
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:25,331
These TA's were whispering,

164
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:29,168
so I figured it had to be good.

165
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,837
They were talking about... yes.

166
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,938
"How to make magical gin."

167
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,208
Mmm, gin and tonic.

168
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,977
Strong, classic.

169
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,208
No one kicks that out
of a party.

170
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,313
Me likey.

171
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,345
Good, but this you hatey.

172
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,080
I only got part of the spell.

173
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,045
We have to dig out the rest
in the library.

174
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,436
Why don't you two just fu**?

175
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,338
No?

176
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,977
Then try this:

177
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,948
work!

178
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,388
I'm fine, okay

179
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,128
I'm just...

180
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,929
I got hooked up with
some sketchy people,

181
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,032
but I'm fine.
Okay?

182
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,811
I'll get to this tomorrow.

183
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,110
Blood's not going to
come out of that sweater.

184
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,112
You should just throw it out.

185
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,953
Okay, thanks...

186
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,851
For getting me home.

187
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,285
I'll call you.

188
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,057
- I'm staying.
- What?

189
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,458
To make sure you're okay.

190
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,530
You really don't
have to do that, I'm...

191
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,397
The blankets still here?

192
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,368
Yup.

193
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,081
What is this?

194
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,449
It's Arabic.

195
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,350
I flunked Arabic.

196
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,552
I got an A.

197
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,424
Well, partly because I paid
for the exam answers

198
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,559
in nipple clamps.

199
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,428
Bag Of Dicks is sounding
awful good.

200
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,559
Ooh, copy that.

201
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,836
Whoa.

202
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,097
She means "Hi."

203
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,936
Are you guys trying
to translate Arabic

204
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,208
because I aced it here?

205
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,839
I mean, it was a couple
years ago, but...

206
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,311
Yeah, mm-hmm.

207
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,380
Cry for help.

208
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,051
Answered.

209
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,290
- Mike.
- Eliot.

210
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,828
Margo.

211
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,315
Yes, yes.

212
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:21,527
By all means,
congratulate yourselves.

213
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:26,398
You are both such winners.

214
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,029
Possibly your first
intelligent communiqué

215
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:07,306
You should have been
rendered mute long ago.

216
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,437
Now you're probably wondering,

217
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,642
"What next?"

218
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,917
Bujold's Nail Extraction,
that's what.

219
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,365
- You need help.
- "Help."

220
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,212
You can't keep going like this.

221
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,109
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

222
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,478
Jules.

223
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,209
Please.

224
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,214
This is just like Daddy.

225
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,145
Daddy was a drunk.

226
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,621
He was crazy.
I'm not...

227
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:55,019
James told us he's worried.

228
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,451
James?

229
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,456
Well, let me bring you
up to speed.

230
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,988
James doesn't remember me...
at all.

231
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,955
He called last month.

232
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,404
Said the reason you dropped out
was your recovery.

233
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:09,668
Well, so much
for "anonymous," right?

234
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,706
He cares, Julia.
So do I.

235
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,407
It's why I left eight messages.

236
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,278
I mean if I had known
that you were...

237
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,448
Mom knows you got arrested.

238
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,049
She has to keep this
out of the papers.

239
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,520
She just got elected
to the board of the Met

240
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,187
and is trying to close
on a new co-op.

241
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,318
Of course she is.

242
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,663
She said you're gonna
get help, or...

243
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:33,258
Or what?

244
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,289
You tell her that I'm not Daddy.
I'm not crazy.

245
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,996
She's not sticking me someplace
to rot where she stuck him.

246
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,401
She's not gonna let go of this.

247
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,365
Well,
I'm sorry, what can she do?

248
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,135
You know, I'm an adult.

249
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,411
Who disappeared,

250
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,312
confessed to being on drugs,
got arrested.

251
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,775
You think she doesn't
go to the opera

252
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,783
with ten judges who would
happily commit you?

253
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:02,585
She's Mom.

254
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,419
Fu**ing bitch.

255
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,564
Right down to her lizard pumps.

256
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,029
But I'm not.

257
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,801
I love you

258
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,270
and I can keep her away

259
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,071
and get you help.

260
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,609
Just please let me.

261
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,810
I called a place.

262
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,052
They can take you tomorrow.

263
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,216
A "place"?

264
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,687
Barely.

265
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,555
You may now speak.

266
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,836
You remain silent?

267
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,568
Perhaps you're teachable
after all.

268
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,141
Good.

269
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,242
As that which you
will now learn,

270
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,845
few know
and even fewer understand.

271
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,187
Mind control.

272
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,518
And these...

273
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,159
Are your first subjects.

274
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,559
Uh...

275
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,495
isn't that kind of unethical?

276
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,230
I mean, even if they're bugs,
they're alive.

277
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,436
They have free will.

278
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,197
We've been taught not to

279
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,766
try to control living things.

280
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,736
How was your lunch today?

281
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,854
Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no?

282
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,707
And how much free will

283
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,675
was exerted by the cow?

284
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,356
Mind control
is in everything, everywhere.

285
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,587
We make only one choice:

286
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,228
are you the controller

287
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,859
or controlled?

288
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:04,409
You do not like the moth I see.

289
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,640
Good.

290
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,605
That which you hate...

291
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,515
or fear,

292
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:15,217
will motivate you to enslave it.

293
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,689
Ah.

294
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,560
My favorite.

295
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,667
You're psychic?

296
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,712
- You're also Traveler?
- Yeah.

297
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:46,475
What idiot marked you there?
Don't tell me.

298
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,386
- A well-meaning educator.
- It's saving my life.

299
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,589
It's chaining you to a rock.

300
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,790
You are free.

301
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,261
More free than almost anyone
in this universe

302
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,202
or any other.
Ah.

303
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,527
Where you think
you're sticking that?

304
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,666
They told you not to travel, eh?

305
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,913
Too unpredictable,
too hard to control...

306
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,877
Yeah, because it is.
I got zero control.

307
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,778
I don't... I don't even have
a decent sense of direction.

308
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,310
Is like telling eagle

309
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:20,276
to fear heights.

310
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,386
I teach you to soar.

311
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,658
Yes?

312
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,307
So... so, wait.

313
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,338
So, um...
so, so you know Rick?

314
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,575
Oh, my God, Rick is...
is great.

315
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,981
This magic gin better make us
see unicorns that fart rainbows.

316
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Guys, we have a lot
of work to do here.

317
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,760
Just bang.

318
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,291
Now!

319
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,906
Okay, that was weird.

320
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,514
Describe.

321
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,316
Yeah, I was in
my hometown in... in Florida.

322
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,589
Weird. Dull.
Again.

323
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,764
Yes?

324
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:40,966
Uh, desert.

325
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,597
- Earth?
- Yeah.

326
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,642
Maybe Afghanistan.
There were guys with guns.

327
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,997
Um, I think I saw a drone.

328
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,866
Again.

329
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,605
Fu**ing volcano!

330
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,846
Jesus.

331
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,020
Which you survived.
Gold star.

332
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,460
Well, you seem
to be the only ones

333
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,761
who can't complete the task.

334
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,563
In one case, surprising.

335
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,766
The other...

336
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,705
We try something new.

337
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,682
The rings are wired to zap.

338
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,686
Bug flies into ring.

339
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,517
Ah, Jesus.

340
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,390
Your fate is now tied

341
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,360
to the lowest form
of sentient life.

342
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,396
I deem that...

343
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,527
appropriate.

344
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,869
Let's just get one.

345
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,670
Okay.

346
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,872
Upper left.

347
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,808
Okay.

348
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:05,824
Okay.

349
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,457
- It's working.
- Yeah.

350
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,088
Okay.

351
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,764
Yes! Yes!

352
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,896
Whoa, I am so...
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

353
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,431
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

354
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,096
It's okay.

355
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,172
Whoa... ow.

356
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,143
Quentin!

357
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,917
I... I...
I don't, um...

358
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,549
I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry, really sorry...

359
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,655
Jesus.

360
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,058
Is that vodka?

361
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,789
You want me to flunk him

362
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:52,425
so you can pass this test
with flying colors alone?

363
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,172
No, sir.

364
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:59,702
I tried.

365
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,009
Again.

366
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,778
No.

367
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,714
Again.

368
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,822
Ha, yes! Yeah!

369
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,756
Oh, my God.

370
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,161
Where's the joy?

371
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,996
The fun?

372
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,627
Why are you both determined
to be so fu**ing bland?

373
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:32,471
Wait, are you flunking us?

374
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,842
Sadly, I cannot.

375
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,512
Rest. Eat.

376
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,983
Meet me in the entry at 5:00.

377
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:48,249
I almost, uh...

378
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,622
I almost died today

379
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,763
and I... I realized
I didn't want to die

380
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,888
without knowing, so...

381
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,025
if you...

382
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,997
if you feel like telling me,

383
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,628
I'm here.

384
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,603
I don't have
to tell you anything.

385
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,570
I just have to drop my wards...

386
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,643
let you in.

387
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,916
You can see everything.

388
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,747
Come on in.

389
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,569
Your mom...

390
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,705
Jesus, she...

391
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,047
And she's the only person
you love in the world.

392
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,085
Not anymore.

393
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,865
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Oh!</i>

394
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,906
I'm thinking.

395
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,215
You're too pretty.

396
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,347
- Okay, listen, listen.
- What?

397
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,756
What if this... Marina?

398
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,926
Okay, what if she got this...

399
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,327
what if she got
some serious shit?

400
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:41,199
I mean, like, really dope,
one-of-a-kind magic.

401
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,900
Maybe it'd buy you out.
For good.

402
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,365
It'd have to be pretty amazing.

403
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:52,177
It is.
I've seen it.

404
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,281
Where?

405
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,850
Mayakovsky's office.

406
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,093
I'd just like to point out
that for the record,

407
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:08,792
you guys basically did nothing
except each other.

408
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,696
Todd was more helpful than you.

409
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:15,327
Don't.
I'm just using you for effect.

410
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,203
You're right, Margo.
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,074
Listen, I really hope
we get a chance

412
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:21,972
to get to know each other.

413
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:26,098
We'll give it a whirl
after Ibiza... maybe.

414
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:28,077
Enough, ladies.

415
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,049
- Shall we magic some gin?
- Please.

416
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:48,196
Well, that was underwhelming.

417
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,338
Oh, yeah, smart guy?

418
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,439
Todd...

419
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,440
ice, olives, stat!

420
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,178
Oh, no.

421
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,016
Oh, shit.

422
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,222
Not gin...
G-I-N.

423
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:17,955
This summons a djinn-
D-J-I-N-N.

424
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,363
- A genie?
- Cool.

425
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,366
Shut up, Todd.

426
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,807
Wait, this could be great.

427
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,438
I mean, if he
grants wishes for real,

428
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,843
and we bring him to Ibiza,
I mean...

429
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,076
that's a fu**in' <i>regalo!</i>

430
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:43,845
Okay,
this genie totally gets me.

431
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,730
Whoa!

432
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,031
Whoa! Whoa!

433
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,765
The fu**?

434
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:06,838
Remove your clothes.

435
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,752
Oh, come on.

436
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:20,485
You think this is the worst
it can be for you?

437
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,495
Do it.

438
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,440
Being out there without fur...

439
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,844
It's brutal.

440
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,246
- With fur...
- It's nice.

441
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,907
Uh...

442
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,508
this isn't gonna be weird,
is it?

443
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,378
It doesn't have to be.

444
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,992
How am I supposed to know?
This was your idea.

445
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:04,062
The genie looked at you.
He was talking to you.

446
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,033
I don't even know what he said.

447
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:07,461
It was Arabic.

448
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,896
He said, "Yes, Mistress,
I understand,"

449
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,202
and then something I didn't get,

450
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,903
and then, "I will do
exactly that to him."

451
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,036
To him.
To Mike.

452
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,111
What did you tell him to do?

453
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:18,909
You were right there.

454
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:19,911
I didn't say a word.

455
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,446
You didn't have to.

456
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,147
You uncorked him.

457
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,378
He could read your thoughts.

458
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,383
That is fu**ing rude.

459
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,645
God damn it, Margo.

460
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,321
Okay, just...

461
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,391
okay, nothing bad.

462
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,532
I just wanted Mike to go back
to where he came from.

463
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:38,296
What does that even mean?

464
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:42,997
It would be the place where
you first saw him... maybe?

465
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,167
Let's go.

466
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,042
Oh, okay.

467
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,048
You wished my boyfriend away.

468
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,450
Boyfriend?
He's a random cock.

469
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,090
You are unbelievable sometimes.

470
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:04,247
Other people aren't supposed
to get between us.

471
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,556
He didn't get between us.

472
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,557
I want him with us...
maybe.

473
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,289
- But...
- What's so special about him?

474
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,226
Really?

475
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,501
What makes him more interesting
than the last 10?

476
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:16,170
Uh, guys?

477
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,472
Mike?

478
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,241
Jesus.

479
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,342
Get up.

480
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,580
What the actual f...

481
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,981
ugh!

482
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,553
He'll only listen to you.

483
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:34,281
Stop.

484
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:39,716
Whoa.

485
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,585
Put him back, Margo.

486
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,363
You don't have to say anything.

487
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,096
Just...

488
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:48,027
Fine.
Shit.

489
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,208
Ugh.

490
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,409
Huh?

491
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,278
Oh, God. Shh.

492
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,246
Okay, baby, come here.

493
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,247
I don't get this part.

494
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,179
My full wish:

495
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,645
that Mike would go back
to where he came from

496
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,053
and suck on some other knob.

497
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,515
So literal.

498
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,761
Swag.

499
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,026
Good enough to trade you
out of Marina's hold?

500
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:26,265
Small enough for bird flight.

501
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,309
I'll go mix some paste
for the spell.

502
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,237
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

503
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,106
Go.

504
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:11,313
Your mental wards
are quite strong,

505
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,116
Sultry-But-Damaged.

506
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:17,418
I couldn't read anything until
you dropped them for Penny.

507
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:21,259
Then I saw it all.

508
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,660
You have suffered much
for your mother.

509
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:28,699
And I'm afraid it's not over.

510
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,737
Your mother is dead.

511
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:43,781
A spell of some kind gone wrong.

512
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:47,682
I only learned yesterday
through the school

513
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:52,086
and only just now realized
who she was... to you.

514
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,591
How it all fit together.

515
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:59,427
You are now free of Marina.

516
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,136
But also...

517
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:09,107
they know everything
at Brakebills.

518
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,438
Who you are, what you've done.

519
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,312
- You cannot go back.
- I was forced.

520
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:19,550
Brakebills is not
a forgiving place.

521
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:23,521
You deserve better
than their punishment,

522
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,622
which would be...

523
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,590
extreme.

524
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,434
You're planning to fly

525
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:32,897
tonight with Penny.

526
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,128
You need to think about
his future as well.

527
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,695
His gifts are a curse.

528
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:41,172
Without training and practice,

529
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,509
they could kill him.

530
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,840
What am I supposed to do?

531
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:51,775
What we all do each moment.

532
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:55,253
Decide.

533
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,620
No.

534
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,900
Eliot, come on.

535
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,865
We're gonna miss
the opening orgy.

536
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,205
You're not even dressed.

537
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,310
I'm not going.

538
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,316
Fu**.

539
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,748
- You're still mad?
- No.

540
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,988
I mean yes, but that's not why.

541
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:07,719
I... Mike... Ibiza's not
really his thing, so...

542
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,756
It's ours.

543
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,590
And will be again,

544
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,826
along with the million
other things

545
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,801
that are just us.

546
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:22,568
I only have one Bambi.

547
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,474
You're gonna miss me so hard,

548
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,336
you won't be able to get it up.

549
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,245
That's probably true.

550
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,308
Have fun.

551
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,545
Todd?

552
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,980
Todd.

553
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:34,745
It's your lucky decade.

554
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,420
Pack a swimsuit.

555
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,921
Seriously?

556
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,657
Ground rules:

557
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,458
you need to fit in,

558
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,927
so don't talk.

559
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,396
Um...

560
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,297
See that she hydrates,

561
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:49,299
wears sunblock, and waxes.

562
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,601
Mama's down south
can get jungly.

563
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:56,766
And you're in charge
of the genie.

564
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,756
Hey.

565
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:21,657
Come back to bed.

566
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,690
Be right there...

567
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:36,042
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

568
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,776
Alice, Quentin.

569
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:42,007
I got you both to drop
your fears and inhibitions.

570
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,883
For that you should be
eternally grateful,

571
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,752
but I give you more.

572
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:51,053
I give you your life's purpose.

573
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,756
Go and live

574
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:58,159
to prove me wrong.

575
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,431
Love each other,

576
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,500
be honest and kind,

577
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,636
faithful and happy,

578
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,067
and then,

579
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,708
come back here in 50 years

580
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,039
with your perfect family

581
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:16,914
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

582
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,480
You're welcome.

583
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:22,786
Quentin...

584
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,888
why?

585
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,790
Why the fox?

586
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:30,628
Why not mollusk or firefly?
Why?

587
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,797
The fox knows

588
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:36,098
and I knew...

589
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,769
everything I needed
to survive was me

590
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,500
and it's not just to survive,

591
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,905
but to be happy.

592
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,109
I was...

593
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,778
happy.

594
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,679
The fox is in you now...

595
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:54,452
both of you.

596
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,553
Feed it.

597
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,890
You really are a great teacher.

598
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,864
I know.
