It's Arabic.

What we all do each moment.

552
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,744
Decide.

553
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,423
No.

554
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,357
(WIND HOWLING)

555
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,133
Eliot, come on.

556
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,106
We're gonna miss
the opening orgy.

557
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,834
You're not even dressed. (SIGHS)

558
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,671
I'm not going.

559
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,044
Fuck.

560
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,145
You're still mad? No.

561
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,021
I mean, yes, but that's not why.

562
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:07,786
I... Mike, Ibiza's
not really his thing...

563
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,293
It's ours. And will be again.

564
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,465
Along with the million
other things that are just us.

565
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,939
I only have one Bambi.

566
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,944
You're gonna miss me so hard,
you won't be able to get it up.

567
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,012
That's probably true.

568
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:29,513
(SLAPS)

569
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,544
Todd?

570
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,016
Todd.

571
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,852
It's your lucky decade.

572
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,588
Pack a swimsuit.

573
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,020
Seriously?

574
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,956
Ground rules, you need
to fit in, so don't talk.

575
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,061
Um...

576
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,397
See that she hydrates,
wears sunblock, and waxes.

577
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,570
Mama's down
south can get jungly.

578
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,998
And you're in
charge of the genie.

579
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,485
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

580
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,377
(FLUTTERING)

581
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,448
Hey.

582
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,123
Come back to bed.

583
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,558
Be right there.

584
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,796
(WIND HOWLING)

585
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,502
QUENTIN: Hey, where's
Kady? Who gives a shit?

586
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,336
Alice, Quentin.

587
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,938
I got you both to drop
your fears and inhibitions.

588
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,945
For that you should be eternally
grateful, but I give you more.

589
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,056
I give you your life's purpose.

590
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:56,559
Go and live to prove me wrong.

591
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,523
Love each other,

592
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,395
be honest and kind,

593
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,029
faithful and happy, and then,

594
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:13,171
come back here in 50
years with your perfect family

595
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,408
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

596
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,908
You're welcome.

597
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,951
Quentin.

598
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,380
Why?

599
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,890
Why the fox?

600
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,591
Why not mollusk or firefly? Why?

601
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,987
The fox knows

602
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,799
and I knew

603
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,364
everything I needed
to survive was me

604
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,266
and it's not just to survive,

605
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,032
but to be happy.

606
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,704
I was

607
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,672
happy.

608
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,408
The fox is in you now,

609
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,749
both of you.

610
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,115
Feed it.

611
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,219
You really are a great teacher.

612
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,560
I know.
