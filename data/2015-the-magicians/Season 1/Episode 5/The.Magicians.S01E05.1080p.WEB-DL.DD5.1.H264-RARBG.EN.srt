I thought you would erase her
memory or something... again.

Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

Then she bothers me again.

40
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,386
So she's just gonna
get away with it?

41
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,718
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin.

42

They won't be back here.

I want the new ones she stole
because I helped her.

00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,536
- You're not coming inside.
- Then bring 'em out.

51
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,946
They're locked
in her filing cabinet,

52

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,050
I don't want
to see you get hurt,

54
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,987

55
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,918
She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

Next time, you will not
be so lucky.

That's bullshit.

and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

69
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:40,026
Alumni come and choose
students to mentor.

70

I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

71
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,631
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

72
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:50,203

to come back.

73

This is just one small corner
of the world.

There's a lot more
out there to see,

75

I don't much like the corners

Alice, students
leave every year,

for every lost lamb.

You didn't invite me.

81
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,518
I had to sneak in
just to take the entrance exam.

82
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,126
I made a mistake.

83
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,027
I felt responsible for
what happened to your brother,

84
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,800
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

85

Alice, I was wrong.

86
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,965
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

some kind of spell.

360
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,858
Amazing things are possible,

361
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,963
but cancer,

362
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,826
it's a part of you,

363
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,334
intrinsically, in a way

364
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,666
that magic can't separate.

365
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:16,241
Some people think it is magic,

366
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,978
an old curse we can't break.

367
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,179
So then, somebody
must have tried.

368
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,911
I mean, look, even
if it's experimental, I...

369
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,246
Do you know why Dean Fogg
didn't fix his eyes?

370
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,022
I guess I just assumed
he couldn't.

371
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,321
Treating something like that

372
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,522
requires an enormous amount
of energy,

373
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,586
and that comes at a cost.

374
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,425
So does everything.

375
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,771

of some journal articles.

what you're looking for
might be impossible,

379
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,406

380
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,446

than you can muster.

The spell you were
attempting to cast is part of

737
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,715
a class of magic strictly
forbidden for all students.

738

It is also strictly forbidden

- The best magicians

that spell, and yet you thought

741
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,690

first year student could.

742
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,025

Yes, you can
save someone's eyes.

755
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,327
You can even save
someone's life,

756

their soul in the process.

757

Then why bother?

758
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,684
What is the point
of any of this, of magic,
