1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,599
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,934
You know, it should have worked.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,469
The spell we did
to contact my brother.

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,557
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

5
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,694
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:10,462
- No! No! No!
- I bind you!

7
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:11,649
I bind you!

8
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:15,531
Why did you think that
you had to save me?

9
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,207
He was gonna kill you.

10
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,542
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

11
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,217
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

12
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,152
Bigger, better magic.

13
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:26,056
Let's go steal their shit.

14
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,891
He's not gonna wake up ever.

15
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,726
Marina is a psycho.

16
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,728
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

17
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:34,130
Ow!

18
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,132
You don't know cut off.

19
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,235
But you can actually move
between worlds.

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,537
If the gift does not
kill you first.

21
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,073
Please, help me.

22
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,310
I have a full schedule today,
Quentin.

23
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,412
- What?
- Uh, I just, um...

24
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,275
The point?

25
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,872
What's gonna happen to Julia?

26
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,852
Ah, yes.

27
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,722
Your hedge witch friend.

28
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,384
I'm going to kill her.

29
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,703
I, uh...

30
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,532
I'm...

31
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,235
I'm fucking with you, Quentin.

32
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,556
I'm not going
to do anything to her.

33
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,906
I thought you would erase her
memory or something... again.

34
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:22,376
Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

35
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,073
Then she bothers me again.

36
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,630
So she's just gonna
get away with it?

37
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,717
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin.

38
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:31,630
They won't be back here.

39
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,188
They know what'll
rain down on them if they do.

40
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,224
What they do out there,
it's not my business;

41
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,459
it's not yours.
Do you understand?

42
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't you worry,
Hedge witches tend

43
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:43,535
to crash and burn
quite quickly all on their own.

44
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,766
I want the spells I'm missing
so I can keep going.

45
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,968
I want the new ones she stole
because I helped her.

46
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:51,739
- You're not coming inside.
- Then bring 'em out.

47
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:53,139
They're locked
in her filing cabinet,

48
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,441
and even if I could, I wouldn't.

49
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,244
I don't want
to see you get hurt,

50
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,180
and Marina will hurt you.

51
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:03,116
She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

52
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,518
Next time, you will not
be so lucky.

53
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,921
That's bullshit.

54
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,923
I earned that magic
just as much as her.

55
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,357
Fuck, more.

56
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:14,460
- It was my friend that she used...
- Your friend!

57
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,365
Look, Marina's the boss.
Life ain't fair.

58
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,200
Woe is you. Now, please,

59
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,770
leave before she sees you here.

60
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,211
Think of it as applying
for an internship,

61
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,880
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

62
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,322
Alumni come and choose
students to mentor.

63
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:42,747
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

64
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,824
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

65
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,394
but I'd really like you
to come back.

66
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,730
This is just one small corner
of the world.

67
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,331
There's a lot more
out there to see,

68
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,148
and I'd like you to see it.

69
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,469
I don't much like the corners

70
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,370
that I've already seen.

71
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:03,408
Alice, students
leave every year,

72
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:05,410
and I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

73
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,877
You didn't invite me.

74
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,713
I had to sneak in
just to take the entrance exam.

75
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,877
I made a mistake.

76
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,219
I felt responsible for
what happened to your brother,

77
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,988
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

78
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,324
Alice, I was wrong.

79
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,161
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

80
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:26,063
Just come back for a week,

81
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,766
and if you don't like it,
then, please, by all means,

82
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,034
be a farmhand.

83
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:37,507
This year, we're going to win
the alumni week Hunger Games.

84
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,710
My mentor last year was a nun.
Never again.

85
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,379
I specialize in feet.

86
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:46,549
Broken bones, warts... I have some
very interesting stuff

87
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,518
for fungi of the toenail.

88
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,920
99% of these mentors

89
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:55,558
lead to a lifetime of soporific
bourgeois magic hell.

90
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,451
Alice.

91
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,222
You're, uh...

92
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,702
Hi.

93
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,512
I'm going to get a drink.

94
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,142
- Is Genji your aunt?
- Oh, hey, Alice.

95
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,111
- Is that Genji?
- Do you guys know her?

96
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,646
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

97
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,648
It's like Camp David for magicians.

98
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,950
If Camp David
was run by Caligula.

99
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:26,221
I mean that in the best way.

100
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,394
- Excuse me.
- Wa...

101
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:35,230
I feel really terrible about, um...

102
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,658
I just thought... I wouldn't be
standing here talking to me

103
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:39,401
if I were you.

104
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,141
I don't...

105
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,239
I shouldn't blame you.

106
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:47,808
The truth is,
my brother died five years ago.

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,477
Still, I...

108
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,642
I should go help her.

109
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,295
Can anybody hear me?

110
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,355
Anybody?

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,888
Anybody?

112
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:18,983
Ah.

113
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,318
Penny.

114
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,546
I'm Stanley.

115
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:26,947
I'm your mentor.

116
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,615
Yeah, I didn't ask for a mentor.

117
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,016
I don't give a shit.

118
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,186
You are what you are,
so I'm here.

119
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,454
What, a Pisces?

120
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,322
Travelers are rare.

121
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,791
Hadn't been one at Brakebills

122
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:41,044
in 35 years, I guess.

123
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,563
There's no discipline

124
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,831
that has more power
and possibility.

125
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,234
I get it. It's an amazing gift.

126
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,271
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

127
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,581
I zapped myself
onto Mount Everest.

128
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,548
Lost my leg to frostbite.

129
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:06,485
I'd be dead if not for one

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,254
deeply confused Sherpa.

131
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:11,657
Had the lecture yet on

132
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,759
sticking with astral projection?

133
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,360
I don't watch "Star Trek."

134
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,930
Travelers' training wheels.

135
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,932
Your body stays here;
your mind travels.

136
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,700
It's like being a ghost.

137
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,702
Meditating

138
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,971
won't stop you
from having a wet dream

139
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,412
and waking up
in the Marianas Trench.

140
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,743
This will.

141
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,749
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

142
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,936
Astral projection only.

143
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,020
Full stop.

144
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,661
Won't make the voices go away,

145
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,479
but it might keep you alive.

146
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:58,068
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

147
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,305
This isn't Middle Earth, Quentin.

148
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,341
There aren't enough
noble quests to go around.

149
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:06,843
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

150
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,745
How am I supposed
to impress anyone?

151
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,981
Mm, when you're not impressive?

152
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,783
Glad you asked.

153
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:15,418
Welters.

154
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,154
- What's Welters?
- The worst.

155
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,455
It's a game
designed a billion years ago

156
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,858
to keep students from
killing each other in duels.

157
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,293
It's like chess.

158
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,127
Kind of. Not really.

159
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,531
You use magic to take squares.
It's terrible.

160
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:29,965
I don't know.
That sounds kind of fun.

161
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,302
- It's boring as death.
- You're boring.

162
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,937
- You're boring.
- There's gonna be a tournament.

163
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:38,107
It's supposed to be a surprise,
but I like ruining things.

164
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,142
Each discipline fields a team,

165
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,277
and the mentors will be watching,

166
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:45,715
so don't screw this up for me.

167
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,874
Quentin.

168
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,513
Someone called the admin
office and left a message.

169
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,753
My dad's sick.

170
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,568

00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:54,359
Hello, Curly Q.

173
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,723
Hey, Dad.

174
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:02,524
It's brain cancer,

175
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,990
but it's the good kind
of brain cancer.

176
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,229
Is there anything you can do?

177
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:13,264
Well, luckily there are
some treatment options,

178
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,968
some, uh, really interesting
new therapies.

179
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,444
Um, do you...

180
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,474
Uh, do you feel sick?

181
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,800
Eh, I feel...

182
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,497
decent.

183
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,814
Eh, there was some
dizziness, headaches.

184
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,906
That's why I went in.

185
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,153
- Does Mom know?
- No, she does not.

186
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:37,933
As yet, I, uh...

187
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,158
I could come up with a reason,
I suppose,

188
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,159
but the truth is, I just...

189
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,196
I just don't want
to talk to her.

190
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,615
I'm worried about you.

191
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,638
You have brain cancer,
and you're worried about me?

192
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,539
Will you stop saying "brain cancer"

193
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,008
like it's brain cancer?

194
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,681
I never see you anymore

195
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:07,716
since you went to this new school.

196
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:10,186
Thinking a lot about mistakes,

197
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:14,157
you know, things I would
do differently.

198
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,059
Quentin, by the time
you were ten years old,

199
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,820
buddy, I couldn't sit through
one more card trick,

200
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,000
but if that's what makes
the world bearable to you,

201
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,670
then you go off
and do card tricks.

202
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,805
Don't try to be
something you're not.

203
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,174
You're studying what now?
Finance?

204
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,011
You really a finance guy?

205
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,647
- I'm not a kid anymore.
- Sure, yeah.

206
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,982
Dump out that bag.
Go on. Dump it out.

207
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,484
I'll give you 20 bucks right now
if there isn't a...

208
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,182
A "Fillory" book in there.

209
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,002
Yeah.

210
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:51,259
You know you're still
on my insurance, right?

211
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,862
You checked yourself
into a mental hospital

212
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:56,264
a couple of months ago.
I didn't say a word.

213
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,599
I didn't say a word.
I gave you your space,

214
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,568
but your prescriptions
are still coming here,

215
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,837
which is how I know
you're not taking them.

216
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,540
I don't need them.
I am... I'm better.

217
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,742
I'm not trying
to pick a fight with you, son.

218
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,066
I'm just trying to...

219
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,012
fix what I broke.

220
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,924
- You think I'm broken?
- No.

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,882
I think we are.

222
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:24,424
Need a hand?

223
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,761
We should catch up.

224
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,331
I'm surprised you came back.

225
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:36,703
I still haven't heard
about your walkabout.

226
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,271
Yeah, well, it wasn't
anything too exciting.

227
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,139
I mostly fed
and killed chickens.

228
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,743
I mean, I wanted you
to come back.

229
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,444
We're friends, right?

230
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,447
Uh, I was wondering
if you could do me a tiny favor.

231
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,984
I helped you find
Emily Greenstreet.

232
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,618
Right.

233
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:56,155
See, I still haven't
been selected by a mentor yet.

234
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,992
I still haven't been
selected by a mentor.

235
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,094
We're such good friends,
I just...

236
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,128
I figured you could put
a good word in to your aunt.

237
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,631
If you wouldn't mind
putting in a good word for me.

238
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,900
I just feel deeply
that we are connected

239
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,402
and are meant to work together.

240
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,643
I'll see what I can do.

241
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,289
Julia? Hey.

242
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,412
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm a little early.

243
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,514
I knocked a couple times.

244
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,777
Um, working on this big paper.

245
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,986
I baked.

246
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,093
That's actually good.

247
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,830
It's, like, people food.

248
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,731
What can I say?

249
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,036
You have no idea
how relieved I am

250
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:47,038
to see you like this.

251
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,940
Like what?

252
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,207
A happy housewife?

253
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,625
Better. Not, uh...

254
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,812
High all the time?

255
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,548
I was gonna put it
a bit more delicately than that.

256
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,117
Dad?

257
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,404
Dad?

258
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,733
We need to go to the hospital.

259
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,470
No, they'll just send me home.

260
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,506
I'm fine.
They need to adjust your meds.

261
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,388
I'm not taking any meds, Quentin.

262
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,578
How bad is it?

263
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:31,414
I have a glioblastoma.

264
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:36,219
It's the most common type
of brain tumor.

265
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,489
It's also the most severe.

266
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,257
But it's treatable?

267
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:42,692
There are treatments available.

268
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,795
I chose not to pursue them.

269
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,604
You know, I Googled brain tumors

270
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,573
just in general,

271
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,741
and one common denominator
that jumps out at you

272
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,243
is impaired cognitive function,

273
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,213
so maybe you deciding
not to pursue treatment

274
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:08,146
- without talking...
- My doctors agree with me, Q.

275
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:12,587
The type of tumor it is,
where it's located...

276
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,415
the person who comes
out of surgery...

277
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,512
might not be me.

278
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,094
I don't want you to die.

279
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,431
Yeah, I'm not too crazy
about it myself.

280
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,530
Then why are you giving up?

281
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,948
You remember this?

282
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,322
My dad and I used to build
model airplanes.

283
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,561
And this,

284
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,163
this was my absolute favorite.

285
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,029
Tenth birthday.

286
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:01,101
This is a Nieuport 28.

287
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,803
It's the same plane
Quentin Roosevelt flew

288
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,904
in World War I.

289
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:09,295
When you were
about two years old,

290
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,144
you got your hands on this,

291
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,907
and you broke off
one of the wings.

292
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:18,585
I spent about an hour
with a hot glue gun

293
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,382
trying to fix it.

294
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,816
It ended up in

295
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:25,625
about 20 pieces instead of 2.

296
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,064
Quentin,

297
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,663
sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

298
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,803
They match my 401k up to 6%.

299
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,468
- It's just... it's crazy.
- Dr. Meers?

300
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh, excuse me.

301
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,845
My father's dying,

302
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,911
and I need you to fix him.

303
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,097
If magicians could cure cancer

304
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,355
why would anybody have cancer?

305
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,025
Because we like secrets.

306
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:00,461
There's got to be
some kind of spell.

307
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,296
Amazing things are possible,

308
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,398
but cancer,

309
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,367
it's a part of you,

310
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,869
intrinsically, in a way

311
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:11,205
that magic can't separate.

312
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,006
Some people think it is magic,

313
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,511
an old curse we can't break.

314
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,714
So then, somebody
must have tried.

315
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,449
I mean, look, even
if it's experimental, I...

316
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:24,785
Do you know why Dean Fogg
didn't fix his eyes?

317
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,554
I guess I just assumed
he couldn't.

318
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,855
Treating something like that

319
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,632
requires an enormous amount
of energy,

320
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:34,128
and that comes at a cost.

321
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,368
So does everything.

322
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,576
I can give you the names
of some journal articles.

323
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,403
Thank you.

324
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,405
Fair warning...

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,408
what you're looking for
might be impossible,

326
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,942
and it will require

327
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:52,979
far more energy
than you can muster.

328
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,323
I love you.

329
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:06,558
Oh...

330
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,095
you baked.

331
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,165
You can have one,
if you think you can afford it.

332
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,669
Please, I have the metabolism
of a Jamaican sprinter,

333
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,405
and I need my strength

334
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,309
so I can properly wrap this
bottle of double charmed sake

335
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:27,446
you can only get from a very
particular monk on Okinawa.

336
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,984
But I'm sure Genji is gonna
love your little cakes.

337
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:42,294
This is war, bitch.

338
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:25,680
Ow.

339
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:28,805
You should know better
than to mess with Google magic,

340
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,808
and starting an invisible fire
in your apartment,

341
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,810
still a fire.

342
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,712
You got lucky.

343
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,414
Pete,

344
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,516
there's nothing else
for me to be besides this.

345
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:44,220
There's a whole world
of things besides this.

346
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,189
I almost burned down
my apartment,

347
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,512
and all I can think about
is trying it again.

348
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,027
Pete, there is nothing else.

349
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:55,865
Your boyfriend could have
done this for you.

350
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,867
I just got this stuff at Target.

351
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,535
Not that I'm complaining.

352
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,438
You know, a beautiful girl calls you
in the middle of the night,

353
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,107
never mind she's
a little intense...

354
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,841
You answer.

355
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:37,271
There are other hedges

356
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:39,273
and other safe houses.

357
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,462
I want to know where.

358
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,327
Quentin?

359
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,781
Quentin!

360
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,901
Where have you been?

361
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,137
You're late,
and this is mandatory!

362
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,443
Welters is a game of circumstances.

363
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,111
Simply put,

364
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:21,581
we beat that squad
of flower-power ass-clowns

365
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,650
by casting
to capture those squares,

366
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:27,087
but the squares
won't make that easy.

367
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,190
Each one represents
a different location

368
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,192
and a different
set of circumstances,

369
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,260
so you can't just cast.

370
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:35,928
You actually have to know
how to cast

371
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,697
for those complications,

372
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:40,600
then adjust in a dozen ways.

373
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,835
If you get any one of them wrong,

374
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,704
the whole thing goes to hell.

375
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:18,703
Will you stop
saying "brain cancer"

376
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,706
like it's brain cancer?

377
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:24,342
Sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

378
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:26,177
- Quentin.
- Quentin.

379
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,012
- Quentin.
- Quentin.

380
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,014
Quentin!

381
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:35,986
Get your head out of your twat
and throw the damn globe.

382
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:53,737
Are you okay?

383
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:55,479
I'm fine.

384
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,550
Oh!

385
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,128
Are you sure
you want to do that?

386
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:45,921
Q, are you controlling this?

387
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,090
Do something, Q!

388
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:14,601
One spell so powerful,
it wiped the whole board.

389
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,852
To Quentin!

390
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,104
Q, come on. Celebrate.

391
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,006
Who knew you had it in you?

392
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,310
Easily worth whatever it's gonna
cost to replace the roof.

393
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:28,744
I don't care.

394
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,947
I get your dad is sick,

395
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:34,683
but like it or not, you still
have to think about your future,

396
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,118
and this matters for that.

397
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,519
One of the mentors
came up to me after the game

398
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:38,855
and asked me to come
to the Fertile Crescent

399
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,656
to stalk a river dragon.

400
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,125
I said no, 'cause grand scheme,

401
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:44,593
none of that matters.

402
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,295
Why do you think
you were able to do that?

403
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,531
Please tell me someone
has pointed out to you

404
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,668
that magic doesn't come
from sunshine and ice cream,

405
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:54,703
for any of us.

406
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,508
What you're born with,

407
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:02,210
what gets slammed
on you as a kid,

408
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,645
what happens now,
like your dad...

409
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:11,052
A great way
to get the things you want

410
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,993
is to be so miserable,

411
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,342
you don't want them anymore.

412
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,967
What kind of system is that?

413
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:21,953
You know, why can't it run on...

414
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:24,038
love...

415
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:27,301
or cocaine or something?

416
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:32,560
It's the universe deep-dicking us.

417
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,409
Lie back and try and enjoy it.

418
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,223
- Hi there.
- Hello.

419
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,159
- Pete sent me.
- Uh...

420
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,697
- Show us your stars.
- I can do you one better.

421
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:04,604
Um...

422
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Uh, yeah. Um...

423
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,180
Welcome.

424
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,272
So... what's your name?

425
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,185
Wa... this is it?

426
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,687
- How do you mean?
- This is all you have?

427
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,558
Well, if you know so much,
why don't you show us?

428
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:28,243
No, I didn't come here to teach.

429
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:31,950
At least show us that
cool cloud thing again?

430
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,534
Oh, my God.

431
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,038
What day of the week is it?

432
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,807
Ah, you are asking
the wrong guy.

433
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,218
What is this?

434
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,390
You joining the navy?

435
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,824
Hey...

436
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,437
what's wrong?

437
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,094
It's to stop myself from
traveling to an early grave.

438
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,905
Come on,
you're looking at it all wrong.

439
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,242
Look, every idiot on the planet

440
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
busts their ass. For what?

441
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:24,015
To buy the freedom
that you got for free.

442
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,417
It's not free if I can't control it.

443
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,919
Well, then figure out how.

444
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,188
If you do, you could go
anywhere, any time.

445
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,658
I mean, look, not for nothing,

446
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,028
but you could be the
greatest thief who ever lived.

447
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,258
I'm serious.

448
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,301
- Come on.
- What am I gonna steal?

449
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,653
Hmm, well...

450
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,939
Could start by stealing me
a sandwich.

451
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,279
The day drinking losers

452
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,549
absolutely do not fulfill
the terms of our agreement.

453
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,711
Our agreement?

454
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,257
I want somewhere better,

455
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,830
some place with real magic.

456
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,327
Please.

457
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,298
It's the number two
safe house in the city.

458
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,067
What? In all of New York?

459
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,703
- A city of 8 million people?
- They got good magic.

460
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,338
It's not their fault that

461
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,806
they're the tortoise
and you're the hare.

462
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,175
They're not even in the race.

463
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,043
Look, you want something better,

464
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,879
get out of town;
go to where the talent is.

465
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:33,748
You think the safe house
in Hoboken's gonna be better?

466
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:39,253
There's this place
in the Mali desert.

467
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:42,657
The marabouts have
this object magic

468
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,740
like nothing we have here.

469
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:47,286
We could go.

470
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,701
- Together.
- Oh.

471
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,323
Can't.

472
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:53,463
Why?

473
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,936
Because I love my boyfriend.

474
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:59,044
You slept with me two days ago.

475
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,115
You're welcome.

476
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:05,179
That's a pretty loose fucking
definition of love.

477
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:07,515
What, you think that
you and James

478
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,417
are gonna grow old together?

479
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:12,953
He doesn't know the most
important thing about you.

480
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,287
- Then I'll tell him.
- You can't.

481
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,288
Why? Marina's rules?

482
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,258
Because it's dangerous,
for both of you.

483
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,860
Marina's rules no longer apply.

484
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,695
Julia, you're making a mistake.

485
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,909
Give me spells, and I won't do it.

486
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,640
Right.

487
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:46,956
Please help.

488
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:48,474
Okay, I hear you.

489
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,088
Please help me.

490
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,825
Please come for me.

491
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:57,627
Please help.

492
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:00,830
- Who the fuck are you?
- Let me out of here!

493
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,598
- Lady!
- Someone help me.

494
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:04,534
Come on, can you hear me?

495
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:17,112
Please help! Please help me!

496
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,511
Let me out of here.

497
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:25,349
You can't keep doing this to me.

498
00:29:28,752 --> 00:29:30,204
Whoa.

499
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,364
Okay.

500
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,633
Astral projection.

501
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,948
All right, safety first.

502
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,410
Please.

503
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,573
- Help.
- Hello?

504
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:51,682
Hello?

505
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,861
No...

506
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,530
Let me out of here!

507
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:11,734
You sound talkative today, Victoria.

508
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,771
Are you ready to talk?

509
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,370
I can wait all day.

510
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,111
Hey!

511
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:39,973
You lied to me.

512
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,815
First one in 35 years?

513
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,586
Yes, there was a girl
several years ago.

514
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:48,120
Yeah, well, I saw her,

515
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,456
while I was astral ghosting
into some dungeon.

516
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:52,325
Turns out she's part of that

517
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,394
incredibly famous third year class,

518
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,996
the missing third year class.

519
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:59,932
I didn't know
what happened to her.

520
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,067
I figured she was dead.

521
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,505
You're supposed to be
my fucking mentor.

522
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,403
What the hell
do you want from me?

523
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:12,805
Christ!

524
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:17,683
- Can you get her back?
- Can I?

525
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,118
I don't know where
the hell she is.

526
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,652
You're the one who saw her,

527
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:22,975
and it's not my problem.

528
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,457
My advice?

529
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,120
Get that tattoo
as soon as possible.

530
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:39,170
♪ No more smoke
on the dance floor ♪

531
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:40,671
What's your poison?

532
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,875
Um, I don't know.
I just poured something.

533
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:45,609
Yuck.

534
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,313
I have so much to teach you
about drinking.

535
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,481
It's a three-year program.
Graduate level.

536
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:52,688
It begins immediately.

537
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,685
Relax.

538
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:58,055
This isn't some mentor week
full-court press.

539
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:00,491
- Oh.
- Yeah.

540
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:04,662
Friends don't let friends drink
Long Island iced tea, Alice.

541
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,633
Eliot, I... oh, sorry.

542
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,235
Sorry.

543
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,238
Um, Alice, do you mind if I just
borrow Eliot for a second?

544
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,719
Mm.

545
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,708
How may I help you, sir?

546
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:21,220
What do you know
about Cancer Puppy?

547
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,186
Okay.

548
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:25,815
Okay.

549
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:29,352
Oh, yes.

550
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,987
His name is Gerald,

551
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:33,656
but everyone calls him
Cancer Puppy.

552
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:36,726
He's sort of our
unofficial mascot.

553
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,261
Why does he have cancer?

554
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,997
Because he's 150, Quentin.

555
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:42,899
The enchantment just
keeps him a puppy forever;

556
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,700
it doesn't stop him
from being riddled

557
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,103
with every single disease it's
possible to be riddled with.

558
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:50,539
They've been taking him to
a very confused veterinarian

559
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:53,283
in Ogdensburg. Yes.

560
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:57,887
Hi.

561
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,700
What if I could fix you?

562
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:05,086
You're going to cure
Cancer Puppy?

563
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,624
I found a spell that might work,

564
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,956
but it requires a lot of energy,

565
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,596
and I think I might
have that right now.

566
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:26,732
A little.

567
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:40,219
Hi.

568
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:44,459
Okay.

569
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,290
Okay.

570
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,442
Oh, no.

571
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,775
You killed Cancer Puppy?

572
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:06,546
I was trying to cure him.

573
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:10,750
The spell you were
attempting to cast is part of

574
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:13,186
a class of magic strictly
forbidden for all students.

575
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,622
It is also strictly forbidden
for everyone else.

576
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,491
- I was just...
- The best magicians

577
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,425
in the world couldn't work
that spell, and yet you thought

578
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,160
a middling
first year student could.

579
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:23,101
I had to try.

580
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,536
Why didn't you fix your eyes?

581
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,642
The glasses show me outlines.
I can live with that.

582
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,378
If I had to choose between
my eyes or my hands,

583
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,865
I'd rather be able to cast.

584
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,484
It's on the first page of your
first textbook, Quentin.

585
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,319
"As magicians,

586
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,388
"we are the instrument
and the medium.

587
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,390
We are the chisel
and the marble."

588
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,526
- I read it. I just...
- But you didn't listen,

589
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,894
did you?

590
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,230
Yes, you can
save someone's eyes.

591
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,798
You can even save
someone's life,

592
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,734
but you might alter
their soul in the process.

593
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,029
Then why bother?

594
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,140
What is the point
of any of this, of magic,

595
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:11,675
if we can't fix real problems?

596
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,712
We can fix some things.

597
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,262
So we fix what we can.

598
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:25,088
Get rid of the flare!

599
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,223
Get the kids!

600
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,225
Get rid of the flare!

601
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,830
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with you.

602
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,210
Dad?

603
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,053
- Dad?
- Yeah...

604
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,518
Hmm? It's okay.

605
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,921
I'm just, uh...
I'm just a little tired.

606
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,692
Curly Q,

607
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,700
what's going on?

608
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,051
You were right.

609
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:10,532
You do know your kid,

610
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,568
at least a little.

611
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,497
I could give a shit about finance.

612
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,609
You know I just
want you to be happy.

613
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:22,578
I know. I get that. I do.

614
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,245
Come on.

615
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,991
This is where I've been.

616
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,299
I'm a magician.

617
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,219
Hot stuff, hey.

618
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,345
You usually get me a scone too.

619
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:35,314
Um...

620
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,817
I tried calling,

621
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:40,186
like, a lot. Uh, anyways,

622
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:43,790
listen, uh, 'cause this
is important, so...

623
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:46,625
Okay, let me stop you
one quick second.

624
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,862
Do I know you?

625
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:52,331
- This isn't funny.
- I'm sorry.

626
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:55,168
I think you have me
confused for someone else.

627
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:58,860
Um, sorry.

628
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,673
Little problem out here.

629
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:16,067
Pete! Now, fucker!

630
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:18,503
What're you thinking?

631
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,886
Marina could be back any second.

632
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:21,395
You need to leave now.

633
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:23,664
- You're pathetic.
- I'm really not.

634
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:25,342
What is this,
some sort of sick revenge

635
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:26,820
because I wouldn't
screw you again?

636
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,155
I didn't do anything.

637
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,990
No, of course you didn't.
Marina did.

638
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:31,491
You couldn't get it up
for this kind of magic

639
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:32,559
even if you wanted to.

640
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:33,861
You sold me out!

641
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,828
It wasn't to hurt you!

642
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:38,431
It was to save James from you

643
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:39,932
because you're out of control.

644
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:41,268
You want everybody's help.

645
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:42,935
You want to stand
on our shoulders,

646
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:46,606
and you haven't, not once,
taken any of our advice.

647
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,347
No wonder they didn't
let you into Brakebills.

648
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,620
I gave it a shot.
I tried to get into alumni week.

649
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,222
I just... I'm sorry.

650
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,025
I don't care about becoming
a magical podiatrist

651
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:10,097
or cataloging cryptids,
throwing huge parties.

652
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:13,165
Honestly...
What do you care about?

653
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,403
I don't know.
I'm still figuring that out.

654
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,671
Well, then this is
the perfect place to be.

655
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:22,474
Oh...

656
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,106
Charlie would be
so proud, sweetheart,

657
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:29,781
and you can always run away
to me whenever you like.

658
00:39:30,423 --> 00:39:33,312
What are these two staring at?

659
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:34,385
Quick, here she comes.

660
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,055
Get ready for the first spanking
you won't enjoy.

661
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:38,959
That's actually kind of hot.

662
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:44,128
Dears, while you are both
quite impressive,

663
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:47,265
honestly, the thought
of working with you exhausts me,

664
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,268
and I'm too vain to sacrifice
my looks in that way.

665
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:53,271
No, no, I mean,
we totally get it.

666
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,740
Maybe next year?

667
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:57,463
Sure.

668
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:05,378
Well...

669
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:07,985
What do we need her for anyway?

670
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,087
We can start our own
bed-and-breakfast.

671
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,508
Retreat.

672
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,490
Hotel.

673
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,024
- Bathhouse?
- Mm.

674
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:20,830
Helps if you hold
a pleasant image in mind,

675
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:23,199
such as a baby,

676
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:25,034
if you tolerate those.

677
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,338
Circumstances are more favorable
on a waxing moon.

678
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:30,106
That's not to say
that it can't be done.

679
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:33,280
It's cooperative, so partner up.

680
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:42,085
Lab partners?

681
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,234
About your dad...

682
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:54,897
Yeah.

683
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,245
Well, can they fix him?

684
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:04,072
Can we fix him?

685
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,707
Quentin?

686
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,247
You can get through this.

687
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,585
I wasn't sure
if you were gonna, um...

688
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:22,828
I...

689
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:26,244
I'm glad you came back.

690
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,074
Looks like "Game of Thrones" fan art.

691
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:42,543
Super helpful.

692
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:45,744
You should ask
Quentin and Alice.

693
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:48,858
- Hell no.
- It saw you.

694
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:51,839
Penny, they're involved.

695
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,029
Fu...

696
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,559
All I can say is
it was some kind of dungeon.

697
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,927
This was on the walls.

698
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:02,896
It's a...

699
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:12,405
That's Ember's seal.

700
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,834
Uh...

701
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:32,841
Penny, I think you were in Fillory.
