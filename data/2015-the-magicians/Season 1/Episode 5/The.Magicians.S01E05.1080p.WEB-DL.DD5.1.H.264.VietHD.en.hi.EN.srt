00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,137
                     - You know,
          it should have worked.

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,672
                The spell we did
          to contact my brother.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,440
         I mean, I went over it,
          like, a million times.

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,842
- Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,310
         - No! No! No!
         - I bind you!

7
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,811
                     I bind you!

9
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,515
        - Why did you think that
             you had to save me?

10
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,150
- He was gonna kill you.

11
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,486
      - I'm done here, for good.
            You should be happy.

12
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,221
- When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

13
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,156
         - Bigger, better magic.

14
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,059
      Let's go steal their shit.

15
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,894
  - He's not gonna wake up ever.

      <i> Marina is a psycho.</i>

17
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,732
          - You think Brakebills
         cut you off from magic?

18
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,134
             - Ow!

19
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,136
       - You don't know cut off.

20
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,239
  - But you can actually move
        between worlds.

21
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,541
     - If the gift does not
        kill you first.

24
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,417
             What?
       - Uh, I just, um--

25
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,852
                    - The point?

26
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,554
- What's gonna happen to Julia?

27
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,856
                      - Ah, yes.

28
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,759
        Your hedge witch friend.

29
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,197
          I'm going to kill her.

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,331
- I, uh...

31
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,868
          - [laughing]

32
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,537
             I'm--

33
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,239
           I'm fu**ing with you,
                        Quentin.

34
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,075
                   I'm not going
          to do anything to her.

35
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,912
- I thought you would erase her
memory or something...again.

36
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,382
   - Sure, then her buddies tell
 her about magic all over again.

37
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,884
      Then she bothers me again.

38
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,386
- So she's just gonna
get away with it?

39
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,722
     - I'm not the magic police,
                        Quentin.

40
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,391
        They won't be back here.

41
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,194
               They know what'll
   rain down on them if they do.

42
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,029
         What they do out there,
           it's not my business;

43
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,264
                 it's not yours.
              Do you understand?

44
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,966
               <i> Don't you worry,</i>
             <i> Hedge witches tend</i>

              <i> to crash and burn</i>
<i>quite quickly all on their own.</i>

46
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,572
- I want the spells I'm missing
so I can keep going.

47
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,774
I want the new ones she stole
because I helped her.

48
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,544
  - You're not coming inside.
     - Then bring 'em out.

49
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,946
                - They're locked
          in her filing cabinet,

50
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,248
            and even if I could,
                     I wouldn't.

51
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,050
                    I don't want
            to see you get hurt,

52
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,986
       and Marina will hurt you.

53
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,922
  She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

54
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,325
         Next time, you will not
                    be so lucky.

55
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,727
- [laughs]
That's bullshit.

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,729
I earned that magic
just as much as her.

57
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,164
Fu**, more.

58
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,300
It was my friend that she used--
         - Your friend!

59
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,172
        Look, Marina's the boss.
                Life ain't fair.

60
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,007
                     Woe is you.
                    Now, please,

61
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,610
                leave before she
                  sees you here.

62
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,314
           - [sighs]

63
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,018
- Think of it as applying
for an internship,

64
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,687
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

65
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:40,025
          Alumni come and choose
             students to mentor.

66
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:44,129
     I can understand why you've
       been staying here, Alice.

67
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,632
            I know you feel that
            you've had to leave,

68
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:50,202
         but I'd really like you
                   to come back.

69
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,538
   This is just one small corner
                   of the world.

70
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,139
              There's a lot more
               out there to see,

71
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,541
     and I'd like you to see it.

72
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,277
- [scoffs]
I don't much like the corners

73
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,179
that I've already seen.

74
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:04,216
               - Alice, students
               leave every year,

75
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,218
        and I don't go searching
            for every lost lamb.

76
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,686
- You didn't invite me.

77
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,522
I had to sneak in
just to take the entrance exam.

78
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,125
             - I made a mistake.

79
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,028
          I felt responsible for
  what happened to your brother,

80
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,797
      and I didn't want to cause
       your family another loss.

81
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,133
             Alice, I was wrong.

82
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,970
          You are far too gifted
              not to be with us.

83
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,872
      Just come back for a week,

84
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,575
       and if you don't like it,
     then, please, by all means,

85
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,877
                  be a farmhand.

86
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:38,317
<i>- This year, we're going to win</i>
 <i> the alumni week Hunger Games.</i>

87
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,520
- My mentor last year was a nun.
                    Never again.

88
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,188
- I specialize in feet.

89
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,359
Broken bones, warts--I have some
very interesting stuff

90
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,328
for fungi of the toenail.

91
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,730
          - 99% of these mentors

92
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:56,401
 lead to a lifetime of soporific
           bourgeois magic hell.

93
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,540
            - Alice.

94
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,209
                   You're, uh...

95
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,877
                             Hi.

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,947
  - I'm going to get a drink.

97
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,952
     - Is Genji your aunt?
       - Oh, hey, Alice.

98
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,921
         Is that Genji?
    - Do you guys know her?

99
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,457
                - Everyone does.
             She runs a retreat.

100
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,459
            It's like Camp David
                  for magicians.

101
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,761
        - If Camp David
      was run by Caligula.

102
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,129
                    - [chuckles]

103
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,032
         - I mean that
        in the best way.

104
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,835
           Excuse me.
             - Wa--

105
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,041
 - I feel really terrible about,
                           um...

106
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,210
   I just thought--I wouldn't be
     standing here talking to me

107
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,212
                  if I were you.

108
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,748
- I don't...

109
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,050
I shouldn't blame you.

110
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,620
The truth is,
my brother died five years ago.

111
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,289
                    - Still, I--

112
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,191
- I should go help her.

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,107
     <i> - Can anybody hear me?</i>

114
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,777
            <i> Anybody?</i>

115
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,246
            <i> Anybody?</i>

116
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,919
- Ah.

117
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,256
Penny.

118
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,358
I'm Stanley.

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,759
I'm your mentor.

120
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,428
            - Yeah, I didn't ask
                   for a mentor.

121
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,829
- I don't give a shit.

122
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,999
You are what you are,
so I'm here.

123
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,267
               - What, a Pisces?

124
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,135
- Travelers are rare.

125
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,603
Hadn't been one at Brakebills

126
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:42,607
in 35 years, I guess.

127
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,376
There's no discipline

128
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,645
that has more power
and possibility.

129
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,047
                     - I get it.
           It's an amazing gift.

130
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:53,118
- It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

131
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,394
I zapped myself
onto Mount Everest.

132
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,363
Lost my leg to frostbite.

133
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,299
I'd be dead if not for one

134
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,068
deeply confused Sherpa.

135
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,471
Had the lecture yet on

136
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,573
sticking with astral projection?

137
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,174
    - I don't watch "Star Trek."

138
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,710
- Travelers' training wheels.

139
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,713
Your body stays here;
your mind travels.

140
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,482
It's like being a ghost.

141
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,484
Meditating

142
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,753
won't stop you
from having a wet dream

143
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:30,055
and waking up
in the Marianas Trench.

144
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,557
