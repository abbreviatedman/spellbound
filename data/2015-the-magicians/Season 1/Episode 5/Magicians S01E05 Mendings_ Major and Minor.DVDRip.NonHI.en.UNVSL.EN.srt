1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,526
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:03,646
You know, it should have worked.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,468
The spell we did to
contact my brother.

4
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,440
I mean, I went over
it, like, a million times.

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,670
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,234
No! No! No! I bind you!

7
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,506
I bind you!

8
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,450
Why did you think
you had to save me?

9
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,517
He was gonna kill you.

10
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,448
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

11
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,265
When are you gonna
tell me what all this is for?

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,951
Bigger, better magic.

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,959
<i>Let's go steal their shit.</i>

14
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,891
He's not gonna wake up. Ever.

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,692
<i>Marina is a psycho!</i>

16
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,734
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

17
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,069
You don't know "cut off."

18
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,232
You can actually
move between worlds.

19
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,538
If the gift does
not kill you first.

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,070
<i>Please, help me.</i>

21
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,473
I have a full schedule
today, Quentin.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,416
What? Uh, I just, um...

23
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:52,985
The point?

24
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,553
What's gonna happen to Julia?

25
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,488
Ah, yes.

26
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,617
Your hedge witch friend.

27
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,295
I'm going to kill her. I, uh...

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,063
I'm...

29
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,174
I'm fucking with you, Quentin.

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,073
I'm not going to
do anything to her.

31
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,946
I thought you would erase her
memory, or something again.

32
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,311
Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

33
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,476
Then she bothers me again.

34
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,599
So, she's just gonna
get away with it?

35
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,183
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin. They won't be back here.

36
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,128
They know what'll rain
down on them if they do.

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,164
What they do out there,
it's not my business,

38
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,266
it's not yours. Do
you understand?

39
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,811
<i>But don't you worry, hedge
witches tend to crash and burn</i>

40
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,895
<i>quite quickly all on their own.</i>

41
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,583
I want the spells I'm
missing, so I can keep going.

42
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,769
I want the new ones she
stole because I helped her.

43
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,175
You're not coming inside.

44
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,371
Then bring 'em out.

45
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,123
They're locked in
her filing cabinet,

46
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,775
and even if I could, I wouldn't.

47
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,178
I don't want to
see you get hurt,

48
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,846
and Marina will hurt you.

49
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,053
She only helped you get out
of Brakebills jail to save herself.

50
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,320
Next time, you
will not be so lucky.

51
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,692
That's bullshit.

52
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,391
I earned that magic just
as much as her. Fuck, more!

53
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,543
It was my friend
that she used...

54
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,195
Your friend!

55
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,740
Look, Marina's the boss.
Life ain't fair. Woe is you.

56
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,107
Now, please, leave
before she sees you here.

57
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,180
Think of it as applying
for an internship,

58
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,950
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

59
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,618
Alumni come and
choose students to mentor.

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,354
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

61
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,857
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

62
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,425
but I'd really like
you to come back.

63
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,770
This is just one small
corner of the world.

64
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,273
There's a lot more
out there to see,

65
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,503
and I'd like you to see it.

66
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't much like the
corners that I've already seen.

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,541
Alice, students
leave every year.

68
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,277
And I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

69
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,514
You didn't invite me.

70
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,121
I had to sneak in just to
take the entrance exam.

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,922
I made a mistake.

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,089
I felt responsible for what
happened to your brother,

73
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,662
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

74
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,261
Alice, I was wrong.

75
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,860
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

76
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,497
Just come back for a week,

77
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,838
and if you don't like it, then
please, by all means, be a farmhand.

78
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,316
This year, we're going to win
the alumni week Hunger Games.

79
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,446
My mentor last year
was a nun. Never again.

80
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,317
I specialize in feet.
Broken bones, warts.

81
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,261
I have some very interesting
stuff for fungi of the toenail.

82
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,662
99% of these mentors

83
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:56,595
lead to a lifetime of
soporific bourgeois magic hell.

84
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,234
Alice.

85
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,276
You're, uh...

86
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,535
Hi.

87
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm going to get a drink.

88
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,978
Is Genji your aunt?

89
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,749
Oh, hey, Alice. Is that Genji?

90
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,016
Do you guys know her?

91
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,320
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

92
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,461
It's like Camp
David for Magicians.

93
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,928
If Camp David
was run by Caligula.

94
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,899
I mean that in the best way.

95
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,833
Excuse me.

96
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,702
I feel really
terrible about, um...

97
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,854
I just thought, I
wouldn't be standing here

98
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,642
talking to me if I were you.

99
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,947
I don't...

100
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,454
I shouldn't blame you. The truth
is, my brother died five years ago.

101
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,355
Still, I...

102
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,923
I should go help her.

103
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,506
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

104
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,809
<i>Anybody?</i>

105
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,074
<i>Anybody?</i>

106
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,652
Ah.

107
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,315
Penny.

108
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,722
I'm Stanley. I'm your mentor.

109
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,341
Yeah, I didn't ask for a mentor.

110
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,864
I don't give a shit.

111
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,030
You are what you
are, so, I'm here.

112
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,294
What, a Pisces?

113
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,102
Travelers are rare.

114
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,198
Hadn't been one at
Brakebills in 35 years, I guess.

115
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,638
There's no discipline that
has more power and possibility.

116
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,046
I get it. It's an amazing gift.

117
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,052
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,359
I zapped myself onto Mount
Everest. Lost my leg to frostbite.

119
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:09,802
I'd be dead if not for one
deeply confused Sherpa.

120
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,501
Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

121
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,174
I don't watch <i>Star Trek.</i>

122
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,678
Travelers' training wheels.

123
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,146
Your body stays
here, your mind travels.

124
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,473
It's like being a ghost.

125
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,718
Meditating won't stop you
from having a wet dream

126
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,052
and waking up in
the Marianas Trench.

127
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,455
This will.

128
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,360
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

129
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,094
Astral projection only.

130
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,567
Full stop.

131
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,372
Won't make the voices go away,

132
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,844
but it might keep you alive.

133
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,780
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

134
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,217
This isn't Middle
Earth, Quentin.

135
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,984
There aren't enough
noble quests to go around.

136
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,490
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

137
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,628
How am I supposed
to impress anyone?

138
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,598
Mmm. When you're not
impressive. Glad you asked.

139
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,102
Welters.

140
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,927
What's Welters? The worst.

141
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,473
It's a game designed
a billion years ago

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,600
to keep students from
killing each other in duels.

143
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,010
It's like chess.
Kind of. Not really.

144
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,379
You use magic to take
squares. It's terrible.

145
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,960
I don't know. That sounds fun.

146
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:31,984
It's boring as death.

147
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,884
You're boring. You're boring.

148
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,855
There's gonna be a tournament.

149
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,892
It's supposed to be a
surprise, but I like ruining things.

150
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,851
Each discipline fields a team,

151
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,089
and the mentors
will be watching,

152
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,632
so, don't screw this up for me.

153
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,583
Quentin.

154
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,192
Someone called the admin
office and left a message.

155
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,169
My dad's sick.

156
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,762
Hello, Curly Q.

157
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,569
Hey, Dad.

158
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,373
It's brain cancer,

159
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,347
but it's the good
kind of brain cancer.

160
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,813
Is there anything you can do?

161
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,446
Luckily, there are
some treatment options,

162
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,014
some really interesting
new therapies.

163
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,551
Um, do you...

164
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,959
Uh, do you feel sick?

165
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,263
Nah. I feel decent.

166
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,000
Eh, there was some
dizziness, headaches.

167
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,802
That's why I went in.

168
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,942
Does Mom know?

169
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,410
No, she does not as yet. I...

170
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,644
I could come up with
a reason, I suppose,

171
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,513
but the truth is

172
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,485
I just don't want
to talk to her.

173
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,916
I'm worried about you.

174
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,372
You have brain cancer,
and you're worried about me?

175
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,262
Will you stop
saying "brain cancer"

176
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,198
like it's brain cancer?

177
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,471
I never see you anymore since
you went to this new school.

178
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,637
Thinking a lot about mistakes,

179
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,112
you know, things I
would do differently.

180
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,676
Quentin, by the time
you were 10 years old,

181
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,017
buddy, I couldn't sit
through one more card trick.

182
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,457
But if that's what makes
the world bearable to you,

183
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,295
then you go off
and do card tricks.

184
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,194
Don't try to be
something you're not.

185
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,556
You're studying
what now? Finance?

186
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,571
You really a finance guy?

187
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,969
I'm not a kid anymore.

188
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,267
Sure, yeah.

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,571
Dump out that bag.
Go on. Dump it out.

190
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,974
I'll give you 20 bucks right now

191
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,911
if there isn't a
Fillory book in there.

192
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,939
Yeah.

193
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,781
You know you're still
on my insurance, right?

194
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,084
You checked yourself into a mental
hospital a couple of months ago.

195
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,093
I didn't say a word. I didn't say
a word. I gave you your space.

196
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,992
But your prescriptions
are still coming here,

197
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,257
which is how I know
you're not taking them.

198
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,993
I don't need them. I'm better.

199
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,729
I'm not trying to pick
a fight with you, son.

200
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,534
I'm just trying to
fix what I broke.

201
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,874
You think I'm broken? No.

202
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,605
I think we are.

203
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,344
Need a hand?

204
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,280
We should catch up.

205
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,254
I'm surprised you came back.

206
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,357
I still haven't heard
about your walkabout.

207
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,009
Yeah, well, it wasn't
anything too exciting.

208
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,524
I mostly fed and
killed chickens.

209
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,967
I mean, I wanted
you to come back.

210
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,198
We're friends, right?

211
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,601
Uh, I was wondering if
you could do me a tiny favor.

212
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,635
I helped you find
Emily Greenstreet.

213
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,039
Right.

214
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,717
See, I still haven't been
selected by a mentor yet.

215
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,452
I still haven't been
selected by a mentor.

216
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,614
We're such good
friends, I just...

217
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,667
I figured you could put a
good word in to your aunt.

218
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,092
If you wouldn't mind
putting in a good word for me.

219
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,254
I just feel deeply
that we are connected

220
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,820
and are meant to work together.

221
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,230
I'll see what I can do.

222
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,729
Julia? Hey.

223
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,774
Hey.

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,935
Sorry, I'm a little early. I
knocked a couple times.

225
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,012
Um, working on this big paper.

226
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,641
Hmm. I baked.

227
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,682
That's actually good.

228
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,316
It's, like, people food.

229
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,621
What can I say?

230
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,166
You have no idea how
relieved I am to see you like this.

231
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,633
Like what? A happy housewife?

232
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,003
Better. Not, uh...

233
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,270
High all the time?

234
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,675
I was gonna put it a bit
more delicately than that.

235
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,442
Dad?

236
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,251
Dad?

237
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,254
We need to go to the hospital.

238
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,832
No, they'll just send
me home. I'm fine.

239
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,699
They need to adjust your meds.

240
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,238
I'm not taking any
meds, Quentin.

241
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,133
How bad is it?

242
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,812
I have a glioblastoma.

243
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,511
It's the most common
type of brain tumor.

244
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,019
It's also the most severe.

245
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,645
But it's treatable?

246
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,123
There are treatments available.

247
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,285
I chose not to pursue them.

248
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,902
You know, I googled
brain tumors just in general.

249
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,705
And one common denominator

250
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,718
that jumps out at you is
impaired cognitive function,

251
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,677
so maybe you deciding not to

252
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,440
pursue treatment
without talking...

253
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,913
My doctors agree with me, Q.

254
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,443
The type of tumor it
is, where it's located,

255
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,284
the person who
comes out of surgery,

256
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,787
might not be me.

257
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,088
I don't want you to die. Yeah...

258
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,929
I'm not too crazy
about it myself.

259
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,792
Then why are you giving up?

260
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,413
You remember this?

261
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,380
My dad and I used to
build model airplanes.

262
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,592
And this, this was
my absolute favorite.

263
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,489
Tenth birthday.

264
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,826
This is a Nieuport 28.

265
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,361
It's the same plane Quentin
Roosevelt flew in World War I.

266
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,106
When you were
about two years old,

267
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,911
you got your hands on this and
you broke off one of the wings.

268
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,514
I spent about an hour with
a hot glue gun, trying to fix it.

269
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:26,718
It ended up in about
20 pieces instead of two.

270
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:32,058
Quentin, sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

271
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,196
They match my 401 up to 6%.

272
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,465
It's just... It's crazy.

273
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,803
Dr. Meers?

274
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:50,544
My father's dying, and
I need you to fix him.

275
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,116
If Magicians could cure cancer,

276
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,053
why would anybody have cancer?

277
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,021
Because we like secrets.

278
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,588
There's got to be
some kind of spell.

279
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,587
Amazing things are possible.

280
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,493
But cancer, it's a part of you,

281
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,305
intrinsically, in a way
that magic can't separate.

282
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,642
Some people think it is magic,

283
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,174
an old curse we can't break.

284
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,880
So, then, somebody
must have tried.

285
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,780
Look, even if it's
experimental, I...

286
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,184
Do you know why Dean
Fogg didn't fix his eyes?

287
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,812
I guess I just
assumed he couldn't.

288
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:33,053
Treating something like that requires
an enormous amount of energy,

289
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,825
and that comes at a cost.

290
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,988
So does everything.

291
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,526
I can give you the names
of some journal articles.

292
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,635
Thank you.

293
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,196
Fair warning.

294
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,801
What you're looking
for might be impossible,

295
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,279
and it will require far more
energy than you can muster.

296
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,522
I love you.

297
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,093
Oh...

298
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,056
You baked.

299
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,466
You can have one, if
you think you can afford it.

300
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,363
Please, I have the metabolism
of a Jamaican sprinter.

301
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,773
And I need my strength

302
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,300
so I can properly wrap this
bottle of double-charmed sake

303
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,439
you can only get from a very
particular monk on Okinawa.

304
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,847
But I'm sure Genji is
gonna love your little cakes.

305
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,291
This is war, bitch.

306
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,372
Ow.

307
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,541
You should know better than
to mess with Google magic.

308
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,870
And starting an invisible
fire in your apartment,

309
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,175
still a fire.

310
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,241
You got lucky.

311
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:43,018
Pete, there's nothing else
for me to be besides this.

312
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,253
There's a whole world
of things besides this.

313
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,490
I almost burned
down my apartment,

314
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,530
and all I can think
about is trying it again.

315
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,463
Pete, there is nothing else.

316
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,197
Your boyfriend could
have done this for you.

317
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,896
I just got this stuff at Target.

318
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,035
Not that I'm complaining.

319
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,628
You know, a beautiful girl calls
you in the middle of the night,

320
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,213
never mind she's
a little intense...

321
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,472
you answer.

322
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,936
There are other Hedges
and other safe houses.

323
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,809
I want to know where.

324
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,566
Quentin?

325
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,801
Quentin!

326
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:09,935
Where have you been?

327
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,103
You're late, and
this is mandatory!

328
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,147
<i>Welters is a game
of circumstances.</i>

329
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,849
<i>Simply put, we beat that squad
of flower-power ass-clowns</i>

330
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,687
<i>by casting to capture
those squares,</i>

331
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,392
<i>but the squares
won't make that easy.</i>

332
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,294
<i>Each one represents
a different location</i>

333
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,356
<i>and a different set
of circumstances,</i>

334
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,425
<i>so, you can't just cast.</i>

335
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:40,098
<i>You actually have to know how
to cast for those complications,</i>

336
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,570
<i>then adjust in a dozen ways.</i>

337
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,910
<i>If you get any one of them
wrong, the whole thing goes to hell.</i>

338
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,938
<i>Will you stop
saying "brain cancer"</i>

339
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,040
<i>like it's brain cancer?</i>

340
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,785
<i>Sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.</i>

341
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,115
Quentin. TED: <i>Quentin.</i>

342
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,146
Quentin. TED: <i>Quentin.</i>

343
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,852
Quentin!

344
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,388
Get your head out of your
twat and throw the damn globe.

345
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,709
Are you okay?

346
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,908
I'm fine.

347
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,270
Are you sure you
want to do that?

348
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,227
Q, are you controlling this?

349
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,030
Q, do something!

350
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,596
<i>One spell so powerful,
it wiped the whole board.</i>

351
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,029
To Quentin!

352
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,928
Q, come on, celebrate.

353
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,901
Who knew you had it in you?

354
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,073
Easily worth whatever
it's gonna cost

355
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,336
to replace the roof.

356
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,704
I don't care.

357
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,837
I get your dad is sick.

358
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,438
But like it or not,

359
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,007
you still have to think about your
future, and this matters for that.

360
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,428
One of the mentors came
up to me after the game

361
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,479
and asked me to come to the
Fertile Crescent to stalk a river dragon.

362
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,385
I said no, 'cause grand
scheme, none of that matters.

363
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,526
Why do you think you
were able to do that?

364
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,457
Please tell me someone
has pointed out to you

365
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,435
that magic doesn't come from
sunshine and ice cream, for any of us.

366
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,475
What you're born with, what
gets slammed on you as a kid,

367
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,405
what happens
now, like your dad...

368
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,011
A great way to get
the things you want

369
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:18,581
is to be so miserable, you
don't want them anymore.

370
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,522
What kind of system is that?

371
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,228
You know, why
can't it run on love,

372
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,459
or cocaine or something?

373
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,206
It's the universe
deep-dicking us.

374
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,039
Lie back and try and enjoy it.

375
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,014
Hi there.

376
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,114
Hello.

377
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,351
Pete sent me.

378
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,096
Show us your stars.

379
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,530
I can do you one better.

380
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,671
Um...

381
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,232
Uh, yeah. Um, welcome.

382
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,104
So, what's your name?

383
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,378
This is it?

384
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,380
How do you mean?

385
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,514
This is all you have?

386
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,522
Well, if you know so much,
why don't you show us?

387
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,119
No, I didn't come here to teach.

388
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,290
At least show us that
cool cloud thing again?

389
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,096
Oh, my God.

390
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,839
What day of the week is it?

391
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,571
I don't know. You are
asking the wrong guy.

392
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,281
What is this?

393
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,854
You joining the Navy?

394
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,523
Hey. What's wrong?

395
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,462
It's to stop myself from
traveling to an early grave.

396
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,768
Come on, you're
looking at it all wrong.

397
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:22,109
Look, every idiot on the
planet busts their ass.

398
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:26,310
For what? To buy the
freedom that you got for free.

399
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,849
It's not freedom
if I can't control it.

400
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,189
Well, then figure out how.

401
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,993
If you do, you could
go anywhere, any time.

402
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,554
I mean, look, not for nothing,

403
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,531
but you could be the
greatest thief who ever lived.

404
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,901
I'm serious.

405
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,504
Come on.

406
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,200
What am I gonna steal?

407
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,643
Hmm. Well, could start
by stealing me a sandwich.

408
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,951
The day-drinking
losers absolutely do not

409
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,816
fulfill the terms
of our agreement.

410
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,285
Our agreement?

411
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,725
I want somewhere better,
some place with real magic.

412
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:14,991
Please.

413
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,099
It's the number two
safe house in the city.

414
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,833
What? In all of New York?

415
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,050
A city of eight million people?

416
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,702
They got good magic.

417
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,575
It's not their fault that they're
the tortoise and you're the hare.

418
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,978
They're not even in the race.

419
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,843
Look, you want something better,

420
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,715
get out of town, go
to where the talent is.

421
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,619
You think the safe house in
Hoboken's gonna be better?

422
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,927
There's this place
in the Mali desert.

423
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,525
The marabouts
have this object magic

424
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,088
like nothing we have here.

425
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,292
We could go. Together.

426
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,436
Oh.

427
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,895
Can't.

428
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,833
Why?

429
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,805
Because I love my boyfriend.

430
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,073
You slept with me two days ago.

431
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,577
You're welcome.

432
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,219
That's a pretty loose
fucking definition of love.

433
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,313
What, you think
that you and James

434
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,291
are gonna grow old together?

435
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,520
He doesn't know the most
important thing about you.

436
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,153
Then I'll tell him. You can't.

437
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,130
Why? Marina's rules?

438
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,100
Because it's dangerous,
for both of you.

439
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,692
Marina's rules no longer apply.

440
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,533
Julia, you're making a mistake.

441
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,539
Give me spells,
and I won't do it.

442
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,338
Right.

443
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,094
<i>Please help.</i>

444
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,653
Okay, I hear you.

445
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,665
<i>Please help me.</i>

446
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,229
<i>Please come find me.</i>

447
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,569
<i>Please help.</i>

448
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,800
Who the fuck are you?

449
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,739
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

450
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,437
Lady... <i>You can't
keep doing this to me.</i>

451
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,274
Come on, can you hear me?

452
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,786
Please help!

453
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,050
Please help me!

454
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,189
Let me out of here!

455
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,657
You can't keep doing this to me!

456
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,536
Whoa.

457
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,332
Okay.

458
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,874
Astral projection.

459
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,206
All right, safety first.

460
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,015
Please.

461
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,855
Help. Hello?

462
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,152
Hello?

463
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,266
No! Please! Let me out of here!

464
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,506
You sound talkative
today, Victoria.

465
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,447
Are you ready to talk?

466
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,380
I can wait all day.

467
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,122
Hello.

468
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,770
Hey!

469
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,331
You lied to me.

470
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,378
First one in 35 years?

471
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,212
Yes, there was a girl
several years ago...

472
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,875
Yeah, well, I saw her.

473
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,146
While I was astral-ghosting
into some dungeon.

474
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:58,156
Turns out she's part of that
incredibly famous third-year class,

475
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,783
the missing third-year class.

476
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,624
I didn't know what
happened to her.

477
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,596
I figured she was dead.

478
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,327
You're supposed to
be my fucking mentor.

479
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,499
What the hell do
you want from me?

480
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,997
Christ!

481
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,736
Can you get her back?

482
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,404
Can I?

483
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,846
I don't know where
the hell she is.

484
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,348
You're the one who saw her.

485
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,975
And it's not my problem.

486
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,445
My advice?

487
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,790
Get that tattoo as
soon as possible.

488
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,362
What's your poison?

489
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,768
Um...

490
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,033
I don't know. I just
poured something.

491
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,975
Yuck. I have so much to
teach you about drinking.

492
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,480
It's a three-year program.
Graduate level. It begins immediately.

493
00:31:56,715 --> 00:32:01,244
Relax. This isn't some
mentor week full-court press.

494
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,679
Oh. Yeah.

495
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,789
Friends don't let friends drink
Long Island Iced Tea, Alice.

496
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,331
Eliot, I, oh... Sorry.

497
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,398
Sorry.

498
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,598
Um, Alice, do you mind if I
just borrow Eliot for a second?

499
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,865
How may I help you, sir?

500
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,873
What do you know
about Cancer Puppy?

501
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,480
His name is Gerald, but
everyone calls him "Cancer Puppy."

502
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,684
He's sort of our
unofficial mascot.

503
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,093
Why does he have cancer?

504
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,062
Because he's 150, Quentin.

505
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,065
The enchantment just
keeps him a puppy forever.

506
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,443
It doesn't stop him
from being riddled

507
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,800
with every single disease
it's possible to be riddled with.

508
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:55,330
They've been taking him to a very
confused veterinarian in Ogdensburg.

509
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Yes.

510
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,541
Hi.

511
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,414
What if I could fix you?

512
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,579
You're going to
cure Cancer Puppy?

513
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:12,467
I found a spell that might work,

514
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,392
but it requires a lot of energy,

515
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,425
and I think I might
have that right now.

516
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,843
A little. Just a little.

517
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,646
Okay.

518
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,480
Hi.

519
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,125
Okay.

520
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,055
Okay.

521
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,268
Oh, no.

522
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,209
<i>You killed Cancer Puppy?</i>

523
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,877
I was trying to cure him.

524
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,052
The spell you were
attempting to cast

525
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,730
is part of the class of
magic strictly forbidden

526
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,052
for all students.

527
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,250
It is also strictly forbidden
for everyone else.

528
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,348
I was just...

529
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,236
The best Magicians in the
world couldn't work that spell,

530
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,820
and yet you thought a
middling first-year student could.

531
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
I had to try.

532
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,339
Why didn't you fix your eyes?

533
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,345
The glasses show me
outlines. I can live with that.

534
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,246
If I had to choose between
my eyes or my hands,

535
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,840
I'd rather be able to cast.

536
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,284
It's on the first page of
your first textbook, Quentin.

537
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:54,224
"As Magicians, we are the
instrument and the medium.

538
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,227
"We are the chisel
and the marble."

539
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,353
I read it. I just...

540
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,669
But you didn't listen, did you?

541
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,060
Yes, you can save
someone's eyes.

542
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,568
You can even
save someone's life,

543
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,435
but you might alter
their soul in the process.

544
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,166
Then why bother?

545
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:15,380
What is the point of any of this, of
magic, if we can't fix real problems?

546
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,781
We can fix some things.

547
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,581
So, we fix what we can.

548
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,418
<i>Get rid of the flare!</i>

549
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,053
<i>Get the kids!</i>

550
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,688
<i>Get rid of the flare!</i>

551
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,827
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with you.</i>

552
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,837
Dad?

553
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,940
Dad? Yeah...

554
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,649
It's okay. I'm just,
uh, a little tired.

555
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,894
Curly Q, what's going on?

556
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,697
You were right.

557
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:16,374
You do know your
kid. At least a little.

558
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,761
I could give a
shit about finance.

559
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,276
You know I just
want you to be happy.

560
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,717
I know. I get that.
I do. Come on.

561
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,722
This is where I've been.

562
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,998
I'm a Magician.

563
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,582
Hot stuff. Hey.

564
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,022
You usually get me a scone, too.

565
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,579
Um...

566
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:42,650
I tried calling, like, a lot.

567
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:47,427
Uh, anyways, listen, uh,
'cause this is important, so...

568
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,630
Okay, let me stop you one
quick second. Do I know you?

569
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,733
This isn't funny.

570
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,967
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,339
I think you have me
confused for someone else.

572
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,211
Um...

573
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,878
Sorry.

574
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,993
Little problem out here.

575
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,265
Pete. Now, fucker!

576
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,293
What're you thinking? Marina
could be back any second.

577
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,837
You need to leave now.

578
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,964
You're pathetic. I'm really not.

579
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,803
What is this, some
sort of sick revenge

580
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,218
because I wouldn't
screw you again?

581
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,710
I didn't do anything.

582
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,405
No, of course you
didn't. Marina did.

583
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,957
You couldn't get it up for this
kind of magic even if you wanted to.

584
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,415
You sold me out!

585
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,281
It wasn't to hurt you!

586
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,718
It was to save James from you

587
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,255
because you're out of control.

588
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,815
You want everybody's help.

589
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,290
You want to stand
on our shoulders,

590
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,954
and you haven't, not once,
taken any of our advice.

591
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,895
No wonder they didn't
let you into Brakebills.

592
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,276
I gave it a shot. I tried
to get into alumni week.

593
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,642
I just... I'm sorry.

594
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,171
I don't care about
becoming a magical podiatrist

595
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,014
or cataloging cryptids
or throwing huge parties.

596
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,378
Honestly... What
do you care about?

597
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,956
I don't know. I'm
still figuring that out.

598
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,291
Well, then this is the
perfect place to be.

599
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,697
Oh...

600
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,862
Charlie would be
so proud, sweetheart.

601
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,163
And you can always run
away to me whenever you like.

602
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,398
What are these two staring at?

603
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,068
Here she comes.

604
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,476
Get ready for the first
spanking you won't enjoy.

605
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,946
That's actually kind of hot.

606
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,414
Dears, while you are
both quite impressive,

607
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,684
honestly, the thought of
working with you exhausts me,

608
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,555
and I'm too vain to sacrifice
my looks in that way.

609
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,958
No, no. I mean,
we totally get it.

610
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,087
Maybe next year?

611
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,257
Sure.

612
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,439
Well...

613
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,336
What do we need her for anyway?

614
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,571
We can start our own
bed and breakfast.

615
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:15,909
Retreat.

616
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,508
Hotel.

617
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,414
Bathhouse? Mmm.

618
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:27,522
Helps if you hold a pleasant
image in mind, such as a baby,

619
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,618
if you tolerate those.

620
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,664
Circumstances are more
favorable on a waxing moon.

621
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,665
That's not to say
that it can't be done.

622
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,133
It's cooperative,
so, partner up.

623
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,966
Lab partners?

624
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,581
About your dad...

625
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,283
Yeah.

626
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,526
Well, can they fix him?

627
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,396
Can we fix him?

628
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,163
Quentin?

629
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,631
You can get through this.

630
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,512
I wasn't sure if you
were gonna, um...

631
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,152
I'm glad you came back.

632
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,462
Looks like <i>Game
of Thrones</i> fan art.

633
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,094
Super helpful.

634
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,766
You should ask
Quentin and Alice.

635
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,633
Hell no. It saw you.

636
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,936
Penny, they're involved.

637
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,218
All I can say is, it was
some kind of dungeon.

638
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,919
This was on the walls.

639
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,725
That's Ember's seal.

640
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,074
Uh...

641
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,985
Penny, I think
you were in Fillory.
