1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,525
QUENTIN: Previously on
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,601
You know, it should have worked.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,489
The spell we did to
contact my brother.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,449
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,682
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,250
No! No! No!
I bind you!

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,526
I bind you!

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,444
(CHANTING IN TURKISH)

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,443
Why did you think
you had to save me?

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,521
He was gonna kill you.

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,442
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,204
When are you gonna tell
me what all this is for?

13
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,964
Bigger, better magic.

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,963
MARINA: <i>Let's go steal
their shit.</i>

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,884
He's not gonna
wake up. Ever.

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,689
<i>Marina is a psycho!</i>

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,724
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

18
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,801
(SCREAMING)

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,049
You don't know "cut off."

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,203
You can actually
move between worlds.

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,567
If the gift does
not kill you first.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,082
<i>WOMAN: Please, help me.
(GASPS)</i>

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,482
I have a full schedule
today, Quentin.

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,449
What?
Uh, I just, um...

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,965
The point?

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,569
What's gonna
happen to Julia?

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,491
Ah, yes.

28
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,644
Your hedge witch
friend.

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,325
I'm going to kill her.
I, uh...

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,325
(LAUGHING)

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,081
I'm...

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm fucking
with you, Quentin.

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,083
I'm not going to
do anything to her.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,964
I thought you would erase her
memory, or something again.

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,329
Sure, then her buddies tell her
about magic all over again.

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,522
Then she bothers
me again.

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,360
So, she's just
gonna get away with it?

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,163
I'm not the magic police, Quentin.
They won't be back here.

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,081
They know what'll rain
down on them if they do.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,208
What they do out there,
it's not my business,

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,288
it's not yours.
Do you understand?

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,762
<i>But don't you worry, hedge
witches tend to crash and burn</i>

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,888
<i>quite quickly all
on their own.</i>

44
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,523
I want the spells I'm
missing, so I can keep going.

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,762
I want the new ones she
stole because I helped her.

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,161
You're not coming
inside.

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,366
Then bring 'em out.

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,080
They're locked in
her filing cabinet,

49
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,810
and even if I could,
I wouldn't.

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,170
I don't want to
see you get hurt,

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,891
and Marina will
hurt you.

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,050
She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,327
Next time, you will
not be so lucky.

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,723
(LAUGHS)
That's bullshit.

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,407
I earned that magic just as much as her.
Fuck, more!

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,481
It was my friend
that she used...

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,210
Your friend!

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,726
Look, Marina's the boss. Life ain't fair.
VVoe is you.

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,122
Now, please, leave before
she sees you here.

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,841
(SLAMS)

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,168
Think Of it as applying
for an internship,

62
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,971
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,611
Alumni come and choose
students to mentor.

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,368
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,851
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

66
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,400
but I'd really like
you to come back.

67
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,761
This is just one small
corner of the world.

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,205
There's a lot more
out there to see,

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,522
and I'd like you to see it.
(SCOFFS)

70
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,922
I don't much like the corners
that I've already seen.

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,563
Alice, students
leave every year.

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,282
And I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,521
You didn't invite me.

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,127
I had to sneak in just to
take the entrance exam.

75
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,965
I made a mistake.

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,125
I felt responsible for what
happened to your brother,

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,647
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,280
Alice, I was wrong.

79
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,891
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,485
Just come back
for a week,

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,841
and if you don't like it, then
please, by all means, be a farmhand.

82
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,326
MARGO: This year, we're going to
win the alumni week Hunger Games.

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,483
My mentor last year
was a nun. Never again.

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,321
I specialize in feet.
Broken bones, warts.

85
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,246
I have some very interesting
stuff for fungi of the toenail.

86
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,641
99% of these mentors

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,602
lead to a lifetime of soporific
bourgeois magic hell.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
Alice.

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,285
You're, uh...

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,527
Hi.

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,242
I'm going to
get a drink.

92
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,961
Is Genji your aunt?

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,769
ELIOT: Oh, hey, Alice.
ls that Genji?

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,001
Do you guys
know her?

95
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,367
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

96
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,409
It's like Camp David
for Magicians.

97
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,921
If Camp David was run by Caligula.
(CHUCKLES)

98
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,885
I mean that
in the best way.

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,851
Excuse me.

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,690
I feel really
terrible about, um...

101
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,770
I just thought, I
wouldn't be standing here

102
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,644
talking to me
if I were you.

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,965
I don't...

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,443
I shouldn't blame you. The truth is,
my brother died five years ago.

105
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,371
Still, I...

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,925
I should go help her.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,529
<i>WOMAN: Can anybody hear me?</i>

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,811
<i>Anybody?</i>

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,080
<i>Anybody?</i>

110
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,641
Ah.

111
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,321
Penny.

112
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,769
I'm Stanley.
I'm your mentor.

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,320
Yeah, I didn't ask
for a mentor.

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,890
I don't give a shit.

115
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,050
You are what you are,
so, I'm here.

116
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,281
What, a Pisces?

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,085
Travelers are rare.

118
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,210
Hadn't been one at Brakebills
in 35 years, I guess.

119
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,641
There's no discipline that has
more power and possibility.

120
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,007
I get it. It's an
amazing gift.

121
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,085
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

122
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,370
I zapped myself onto Mount Everest.
Lost my leg to frostbite.

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,801
I'd be dead if not for one
deeply confused Sherpa.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,487
Had the lecture yet on sticking
with astral projection?

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,165
I don't watch Star Trek.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,686
Travelers' training
wheels.

127
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,127
Your body stays here,
your mind travels.

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,485
It's like being
a ghost.

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Meditating won't stop you
from having a wet dream

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,041
and waking up in
the Marianas Trench.

131
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,491
This Will.

132
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,367
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,122
Astral projection only.

134
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,571
Full stop.

135
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,365
Won't make the voices
go away,

136
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,841
but it might
keep you alive.

137
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,809
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

138
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,211
This isn't
Middle Earth, Quentin.

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,005
There aren't enough noble
quests to go around.

140
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,521
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

141
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,651
How am I supposed
to impress anyone?

142
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,611
Mmm. When you're not
impressive. Glad you asked.

143
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,126
Welters.
(GROANS)

144
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,930
What's Welters?
The worst.

145
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,441
It's a game designed
a billion years ago

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,602
to keep students from killing
each other in duels.

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,002
It's like chess.
Kind of. Not really.

148
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,368
You use magic to take
squares. It's terrible.

149
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,921
I don't know.
That sounds fun.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,967
It's boring as death.

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,883
You're boring.
You're boring.

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,849
There's gonna be
a tournament.

153
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,890
It's supposed to be a surprise,
but I like ruining things.

154
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,850
Each discipline
fields a team,

155
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,082
and the mentors
will be watching,

156
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,640
so, don't screw
this up for me.

157
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,241
(INHALES)

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,567
Quentin.

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,161
(EXHALES)

160
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,209
Someone called the admin
office and left a message.

161
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,170
My dad's sick.

162
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,804
Hello, Curly Q.

163
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,611
Hey, Dad.

164
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,366
It's brain cancer,

165
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,324
but it's the good
kind of brain cancer.

166
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,804
Is there anything you can do?

167
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,451
Luckily, there are
some treatment options,

168
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,000
some really interesting
new therapies.

169
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,570
Um, do you...

170
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,006
Uh, do you feel sick?

171
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,290
Nah. I feel decent.

172
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,001
Eh, there was some
dizziness, headaches.

173
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,844
That's why I went in.

174
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,961

a reason, I suppose,

talk to her. (CHUCKLES)

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,642
Hell no.
lt saw you.

703
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,930
Penny, they're involved.

704
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,241
PENNY: All I can say is, it
was some kind of dungeon.

705
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,931
This was on the walls.

706
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,762
That's Ember's seal.

707
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,081
Uh...
