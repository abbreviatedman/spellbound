00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,526
QUENTIN: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:03,646
You know, it should have worked.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,468
The spell we did to
contact my brother.

4
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,440
I mean, I went over
it, like, a million times.

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,670
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,234
No! No! No! I bind you!

7
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,506
I bind you!

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,439
(CHANTING IN TURKISH)

9
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,450
Why did you think
you had to save me?

10
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,517
He was gonna kill you.

11
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,448
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

12
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,265
When are you gonna
tell me what all this is for?

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,951
Bigger, better magic.

14
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,959
MARINA: <i>Let's
go steal their shit.</i>

15
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,891
He's not gonna wake up. Ever.

16
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,692
<i>Marina is a psycho!</i>

17
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,734
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

18
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
(SCREAMING)

19
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,069
You don't know "cut off."

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,232
You can actually
move between worlds.

21
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,538
If the gift does
not kill you first.

22
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,070
WOMAN: <i>Please, help me.</i> (GASPS)

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,473
I have a full schedule
today, Quentin.

24
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,416
What? Uh, I just, um...

25
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:52,985
The point?

26
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,553
What's gonna happen to Julia?

27
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,488
Ah, yes.

28
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,617
Your hedge witch friend.

29
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,295
I'm going to kill her. I, uh...

30
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,292
(LAUGHING)

31
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,063
I'm...

32
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,174
I'm fucking with you, Quentin.

33
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,073
I'm not going to
do anything to her.

34
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,946
I thought you would erase her
memory, or something again.

35
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,311
Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

36
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,476
Then she bothers me again.

37
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,599
So, she's just gonna
get away with it?

38
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,183
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin. They won't be back here.

39
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,128
They know what'll rain
down on them if they do.

40
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,164
What they do out there,
it's not my business,

41
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,266
it's not yours. Do
you understand?

42
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,811
<i>But don't you worry, hedge
witches tend to crash and burn</i>

43
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,895
<i>quite quickly all on their own.</i>

44
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,583
I want the spells I'm
missing, so I can keep going.

45
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,769
I want the new ones she
stole because I helped her.

46
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,175
You're not coming inside.

47
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,371
Then bring 'em out.

48
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,123
They're locked in
her filing cabinet,

49
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,775
and even if I could, I wouldn't.

50
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,178
I don't want to
see you get hurt,

51
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,846
and Marina will hurt you.

52
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,053
She only helped you get out
of Brakebills jail to save herself.

53
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,320
Next time, you
will not be so lucky.

54
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,692
(LAUGHS) That's bullshit.

55
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,391
I earned that magic just
as much as her. Fuck, more!

56
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,543
It was my friend
that she used...

57
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,195
Your friend!

58
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,740
Look, Marina's the boss.
Life ain't fair. Woe is you.

59
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,107
Now, please, leave
before she sees you here.

60
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,842
(SLAMS)

61
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,180
Think of it as applying
for an internship,

62
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,950
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

63
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,618
Alumni come and
choose students to mentor.

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,354
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

65
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,857
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

66
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,425
but I'd really like
you to come back.

67
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,770
This is just one small
corner of the world.

68
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,273
There's a lot more
out there to see,

69
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,503
and I'd like you to
see it. (SCOFFS)

70
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't much like the
corners that I've already seen.

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,541
Alice, students
leave every year.

72
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,277
And I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

73
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,514
You didn't invite me.

74
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,121
I had to sneak in just to
take the entrance exam.

75
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,922
I made a mistake.

76
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,089
I felt responsible for what
happened to your brother,

77
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,662
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

78
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,261
Alice, I was wrong.

79
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,860
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

80
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,497
Just come back for a week,

81
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,838
and if you don't like it, then
please, by all means, be a farmhand.

82
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,316
MARGO: This year, we're going to
win the alumni week Hunger Games.

83
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,446
My mentor last year
was a nun. Never again.

84
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,317
I specialize in feet.
Broken bones, warts.

85
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,261
I have some very interesting
stuff for fungi of the toenail.

86
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,662
99% of these mentors

87
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:56,595
lead to a lifetime of
soporific bourgeois magic hell.

88
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,234
Alice.

89
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,276
You're, uh...

90
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,535
Hi.

91
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm going to get a drink.

92
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,978
Is Genji your aunt?

93
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,749
ELIOT: Oh, hey,
Alice. Is that Genji?

94
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,016
Do you guys know her?

95
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,320
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

96
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,461
It's like Camp
David for Magicians.

97
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,928
If Camp David was run
by Caligula. (CHUCKLES)

98
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,899
I mean that in the best way.

99
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,833
Excuse me.

100
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,702
I feel really
terrible about, um...

101
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,854
I just thought, I
wouldn't be standing here

102
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,642
talking to me if I were you.

103
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,947
I don't...

104
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,454
I shouldn't blame you. The truth
is, my brother died five years ago.

105
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,355
Still, I...

106
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,923
I should go help her.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,506
WOMAN: <i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

108
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,809
<i>Anybody?</i>

109
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,074
<i>Anybody?</i>

110
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,652
Ah.

111
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,315
Penny.

112
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,722
I'm Stanley. I'm your mentor.

113
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,341
Yeah, I didn't ask for a mentor.

114
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,864
I don't give a shit.

115
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,030
You are what you
are, so, I'm here.

116
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,294
What, a Pisces?

117
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,102
Travelers are rare.

118
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,198
Hadn't been one at
Brakebills in 35 years, I guess.

119
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,638
There's no discipline that
has more power and possibility.

120
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,046
I get it. It's an amazing gift.

121
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,052
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

122
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,359
I zapped myself onto Mount
Everest. Lost my leg to frostbite.

123
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:09,802
I'd be dead if not for one
deeply confused Sherpa.

124
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,501
Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

125
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,174
I don't watch <i>Star Trek.</i>

126
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,678
Travelers' training wheels.

127
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,146
Your body stays
here, your mind travels.

128
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,473
It's like being a ghost.

129
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,718
Meditating won't stop you
from having a wet dream

130
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,052
and waking up in
the Marianas Trench.

131
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,455
This will.

132
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,360
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

133
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,094
Astral projection only.

134
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,567
Full stop.

135
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,372
Won't make the voices go away,

136
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,844
but it might keep you alive.

137
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,780
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

138
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,217
This isn't Middle
Earth, Quentin.

139
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,984
There aren't enough
noble quests to go around.

140
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,490
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

141
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,628
How am I supposed
to impress anyone?

142
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,598
Mmm. When you're not
impressive. Glad you asked.

143
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,102
Welters. (GROANS)

144
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,927
What's Welters? The worst.

145
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,473
It's a game designed
a billion years ago

146
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,600
to keep students from
killing each other in duels.

147
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,010
It's like chess.
Kind of. Not really.

148
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,379
You use magic to take
squares. It's terrible.

149
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,960
I don't know. That sounds fun.

150
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:31,984
It's boring as death.

151
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,884
You're boring. You're boring.

152
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,855
There's gonna be a tournament.

153
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,892
It's supposed to be a
surprise, but I like ruining things.

154
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,851
Each discipline fields a team,

155
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,089
and the mentors
will be watching,

156
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,632
so, don't screw this up for me.

157
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,204
(INHALES)

158
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,583
Quentin.

(EXHALES)

160
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,192
Someone called the admin
office and left a message.

161
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,169
My dad's sick.

162
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,277
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

163
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,762
Hello, Curly Q.

164
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,569
Hey, Dad.

165
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,373
It's brain cancer,

166
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,347
but it's the good
kind of brain cancer.

167
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,813
Is there anything you can do?

168
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,446
Luckily, there are
some treatment options,

169
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,014
some really interesting
new therapies.

170
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,551
Um, do you...

171
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,959
Uh, do you feel sick?

172
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,263
Nah. I feel decent.

173
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,000
Eh, there was some
dizziness, headaches.

174
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,802
That's why I went in.

175
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,942
Does Mom know?

a reason, I suppose,

179
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,485

to her. (CHUCKLES)

that magic can't separate.

Because he's 150, Quentin.

keeps him a puppy forever.

The spell you were
attempting to cast

584
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,730
is part of the class of

The best Magicians in the
world couldn't work that spell,

and yet you thought a
middling first-year student could.

590
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
I had to try.

591
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,339
Why didn't you fix your eyes?

592
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,345

Yes, you can save

You can even
save someone's life,

602

but you might alter
their soul in the process.

603

Then why bother?

604
