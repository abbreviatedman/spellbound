This is not what I wanted.

Well, let's short circuit
this whole thing.

You stay out of my ass

But come after me,

that you care about.

anyway.

He's the one who should be
in here, not you.

Okay, Henry.

I've never really seen you
care about something.

222
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,697
- Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

223

- With some limited,
but very important exceptions.

224
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,840
- Very limited.

225
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,014
But seriously, leave.

me way too well already,

I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here

228

today brief.

No matter why you started using,

230
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,668

you can get clean.

231
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,838
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

232
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,738
but the one thing that won't
have changed is you.

Same head, same heart,
same mistakes.

Now, we don't like to hear it,

235
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:06,052
but we need something
or someone to lean on

236
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,192
that is bigger than ourselves.

237
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,718

00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,223
God.

239
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,664
- Well, that's one way
to putting it.

240
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,760
- You know, there is a word

241
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:19,062
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

242
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,265
- [chuckles]

243
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,897

or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

245
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,304
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

246
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,066
- That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

247
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,435
- Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

248
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:35,114
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

249
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,575
- Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

250
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,786
You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

251

you got a nickel.

00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,398
So, what do you believe in?

255
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,700
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

256
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,442
but something bigger than you.

257
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,141
- I don't understand.

258
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,976
- The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

259
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,711
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

260
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,346
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

261
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,422
if we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

262
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:18,121
- Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

263
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,394
- It's a healing spell.
I've seen that

264
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,893
welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

265
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,355
- Actually, trick question.

266
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,963
It's a<i> welwitschia mirabilis,</i>

267
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,196
the leaves are used for both,
healing spells

268
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,001
and for doing exotic curses.

269
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,738
- I thought it was a fern.

270
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,139
- Which is why I brought
flash cards.

271
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,410
- Of course you did.

272
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,140
- Thank you, Alice.

273
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,875
- Could you not--
Could you-- for one minute,

274
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,212
could you not give her
googly eye?

275
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,376
- Oh, God.

276
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,984
- I don't know what you're,

277
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,546
uh, implying or,
um, inferring.

278
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,855

a lot of things.

cable TV,

282
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,529

for a fox.

for one day.

287

- Thank you for that.

288
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,183

or my problem.

289
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,723
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

290
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,148
- I don't need your help.

291
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,955
But if I hypothetically did--

292
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,057

293

to deny that you're interested.

Either, grow a pair

who already did.

I don't really know how.
- Don't be silly.

I don't think
that you could bore me.

311

and frankly any country
not named Texas.

313
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,517

Um, that was a joke.

00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,111
You guys were inseparable.

356
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,967
She gets through the Trials,

357
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,976
passes all of Mayakovsky's test
and then she's just--

358
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,009
- She didn't give me
an itinerary.

359
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,775
- Man, I don't get it.

360
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,153
You act like you're
this panty-whisperer,

361
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,654
and your girl disappears and you
don't even know where she is.

362
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,016
- You see her,

363
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,864
tell her she owes me 20 bucks.

364
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,001
Can I help you?

365
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,297
- What?
- Not you.

366
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,899
Ah, hey, Mike.

367
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,402
- Sorry. I got--I got
a little turned around.

368
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,344
Um, could you tell me which way
the cottage is?

369
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,870
- Yeah. It's like--

371
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,808

373
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:55,730
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

374
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,800
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

375
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,529
Whoa!

376
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,504
Help!
Help! Somebody help!

377
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,038
- Get a transfusion ready, get
the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.

378
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,441
- Can you mend the wound?

379
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,642
- It's deep,
but it's not impossible.

380
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,883
- The weapon.
We need the weapon.

381
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,078
Quentin.
- Mike. Mike has it.

382
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,309
- I need to see the knife
to know.

383
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,554
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
- To know what?

384
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,108
- Find him. Now.

385
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:21,646
- Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

386
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,324
He was trying to kill me
before Penny jumped in the way.

387
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,494
Could have anything
to do with the Beast?

388
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,632
- Why would it?

389
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:28,927
- Because it makes more sense

390
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,828
than somebody new
try to kill me.

391
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,160
- Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

392
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,726
We will certainly ask
Mr. McCormick when we find him.

393
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,973
- Quentin.

394
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,206
Is Penny okay?

395
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,651
- Uh, he's in surgery.
I don't know.

396
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,747
- I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

397
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,549
- I would've told you,
but Fogg wouldn't let us

398
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,981
leave the building until...

399
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,516
- Until they find Mike.
- They did find him.

400
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,721
Professor Sunderland and March
found him trying to open

401
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,694
a portal near
the Welters stadium.

402
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,858
- Where are they taking him?

403
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:10,065
- Have you ever been
in this room before?

404
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,239
It was designed at the turn
of the century

405
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:17,038
for a sect of incredibly
delicate experiments.

406
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,683
Mechanism within the walls,
prevent any spell casting,

407
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,579
it is, in fact,
a clean room.

408
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,883
It was not intended
for this--this purpose,

409
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,786
but it will do.

410
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,218
Where is the weapon...

411
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,224
that you used?
- I don't know.

412
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,626
- Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

413
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,829
- I was in Brooklyn.

414
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,001
Then I was here.
I don't know!

415
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,471
Professor--
- Dean.

416
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,399
- Henry, look I--

417
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,114
Okay.

418
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,679
Okay look.

419
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,938
Look, you know me, right?

420
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,146
I was your student
for three years,

421
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,379
you know that I couldn't.
- I know you did!

422
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,717
- No, you can't go in there.

423
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,663
- What did he say?

424
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,728
- Nothing useful.

425
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,287
- You're just gonna leave him
in there?

426
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,455
- I'm not letting him go.

427
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,063
- No, I mean,
that's inhumane.

428
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,165
- There is procedures
for dealing with magical crimes.

429
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,497
A circuit court system.

430
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,131
They're sending
in a representative.

431
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,836
- What will they do with him?
- They have facilities.

432
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,508
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

433
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,637
- On what?
- On whether Penny lives.

434
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,643
- This reeks of mind control.

435
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,475
- Wait. There was something
wrong with his eyes.

436
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,510
They weren't entirely human,
that--that could be--

437
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,745
- I looked in every scenario
there is to think of.

438
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,021
Spell gone wrong,
doppelganger,

439
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,190
and yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

440
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,259
But there was always the chance
that he did this,

441
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,428
intentionally.

442
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,425
- Good morning.

443
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,772
- Pain killers.

444
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,297
Would be nice.

445
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,072
- Your surgery
was very successful.

446
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,970
Your wounds are closed.

447
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,072
Just one or two weeks of--

448
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,914
Hey! You're not ready
to walk around yet.

449
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,640
- I was stabbed, woman,

450
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,975
I'm gonna find
the motherfu  er who--

451
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,911
- Get Professor Lipson
down here!

452
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,976

454
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,757
What?

455
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,764
- It's spreading too quickly
to be an infection

456
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,033
- The wound is cursed.

457
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,630
Whatever it is,
is growing under the skin.

458
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,332
He's lucky it's not near
any vital organs.

459
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,704
The necrotizing tissue--
- Necrotizing?

460
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,773
- Cell death
within the tissue.

461
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,202
- If it touches
something important--

462
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,836
- How do you fix it?
- [sighs]

463
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,581
Without seeing the knife I...

464
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,237
I have no idea.

465
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,006
- I hate magic.

466
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,354
- I mean, why us?

467
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,249
- You, I get.

468
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,081
I think about stabbing you
all the time.

469
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,516
- [chuckles]

470
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,892
- That was a 100% not a joke.

471
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,191
- You realized that knife
was coming at me

472
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,993
before you jump in the way
of it, right?

473
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,356
I owe you, like,
a Wookie Life Debt.

474
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:54,996
- Get a knife.
I'll stab you right now.

475
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,170
- [sighs]

476
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,639
I keep thinking--

477
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:07,714
- The Beast.
- It makes sense.

478
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,313
- And yet it doesn't.

479
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,376
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

480
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:16,045
- Yeah.

481
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,455
Hey, do you want me to--

482
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,157
Is there anyone you want me
to call?

483
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,328
Parents, siblings,

484
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,727
parole officer?

485
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,659
- I'm good.

486
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,126
No, Quentin.

487
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,204
She cared, she'd be here.

488
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,539
- No visitors.

489
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,713
- Two minutes.

490
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:39,941
- What could he possibly say

491
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,106
that would make you feel
any better?

492
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,283
- I'm not here to feel better.

493
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,354
Please.

494
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:52,223
I was supposed to have
a date last night.

495
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,825
I got all dressed up.

496
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:58,297
- I'm sorry.

497
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:03,167
All this stuff they're saying
I did, I don't remember.

498
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,769
- You were blacked out.

499
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,808
Were you blacked out
when we met?

500
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,431
- No, I don't want
to buy a bible.

501
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,859
- [chuckles]

502
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:39,101
What safe house were you in?

503
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,465
I recognized your ink.

504
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:45,184
You see it more often than you'd
think in a place like this.

505
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,177
- You're a Hedge?

506
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,648
- [sighs]
No.

507
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,607
Classically trained, myself.

508
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:54,515
There's a special school,
called Brakebills.

509
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,350
You heard of it?

510
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,786
- Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

511
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,633
in here to get away
from magic, so...

512
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:06,699
- Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

513
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:10,299
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

514
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,103
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

515
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,405
It's a gift.

516
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,807
- Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

517
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,479
- I'm not the guy outside
of YMCA

518
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:19,707
yelling at people to repent.

519
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,812
- Then what are you, Richard?

520
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:27,423
- Okay, what we call magic is,

521
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,490
a set of tools.

522
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,418
Leftover from Creation.

523
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,064
Think about it.

524
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,329
- [scoffs]
- The power to bend reality

525
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,158
to make and unmake.

526
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:40,463
- Won't God be pissed we touched
His tools without asking?

527
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:46,942
- God--
gods, really,

528
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,539
they don't do things
by accident.

529
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,142
The tools were left for us
to find.

530
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,784
- Right.

Jane carried this doll with her
