1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,625
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,094
Let's just net this
all in the bud.

3
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:05,415
You were the paramedic.

4
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,250
Call me Eliza.
I was there that day

5
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,419
to make sure that you got here.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,789
- We flew here to Antarctica?
- So what is this then?

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,557
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

8
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:18,161
Remove your clothes.
Do it!

9
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,799
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

10
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,304
They know everything
at Brakebills, what you've done.

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,839
You cannot go back.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,908
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,276
Run.

14
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:38,815
You can't keep going like this.

15
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,117
I called a place.
They can take you tomorrow.

16
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,852
A "place"?

17
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,854
- Mike.
- Eliot.

18
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,756
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:24,660
It's a little something
I invented.

20
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:26,229
Oh.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,297
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

22
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,566
A beer?

23
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,102
You are lucky you're pretty.

24
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,937
Eliot.

25
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,273
You're back.

26
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,242
Hooray!

27
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,810
Oh, thank God.

28
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,668
How do you always have drinks
waiting for us?

29
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:48,551
Oh, just a good host, I guess.

30
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,387
Guys, this is my friend Mike.

31
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,890
He graduated a few years ago
and lives in New York,

32
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:57,126
and Margo tried to kill him
with a Djinn, but we fixed it.

33
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,928
This is Alice, that's Quentin.

34
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,663
- They are nerds.
- I could kind of tell.

35
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,466
How was Brakebills South?
Did anyone freeze to death?

36
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,835
Oh, I mean, it was--

37
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:08,771
it was eventful.
I--

38
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:12,141
Why is your face
making that face?

39
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,311
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,513
- They totally had sex.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:19,331
- No, nothing happened.
- I mean, it just happened.

42
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,152
You got drunk
on Mayakovsky's lichen vodka

43
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:25,221
- and you seduced him.
- Maybe I seduced her?

44
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,390
Please. And, sweetie,

45
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:30,393
getting drunk and...
porking a dungeon master

46
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:31,827
is nothing to be a ashamed of.

47
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,397
- Ah, porking?
- I was looking at the pork butt.

48
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,432
I'm going to go take a nap

49
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,826
and pretend that this
entire conversation never happened.

50
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,269
Okay.

51
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,804
Ah, ah, I--

52
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:46,937
- Nice meeting you.
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,215
Hey, eyes on the pork butt, mister.

54
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,914
- He's pretty.
- I know. But I called dibs on him.

55
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,288
Hey, ignore Eliot. He's...

56
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,025
You know, just... being Eliot.

57
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,430
Don't.

58
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,067
I thought "nap" was code.

59
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,773
Can we just talk about this
seriously for a second?

60
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:22,011
What we did was... stress
and circumstances, and pheromones.

61
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,847
The first time,
but not the next four.

62
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:27,283
- You were... counting?
- Of course I was counting.

63
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:30,787
Maybe Eliot's right. We might
as well have been drunk or high, or...

64
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,589
I'm not under the influence
right now.

65
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,458
Yes, we are, Q.

66
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,795
I can still smell you,
but like, fox you,

67
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,763
and I'm pretty sure you can
still smell me.

68
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:42,996
That could have a lot to do
with the fact

69
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:45,843
- that we haven't bathed in weeks.
- Are you in love with me?

70
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,027
I, uh, I don't know.

71
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:53,176
Even if you fell down on your knees
and proclaimed your, you know...

72
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:56,079
I know it wasn't really you.

73
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,651
I think that we need to...
spend some time apart,

74
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:03,653
so we can know what's real
and what's fox.

75
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,663
<i>When they were lost,</i>

76
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:16,065
ancient sailors used the stars
to find their way,

77
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,969
but, for you, they're an obstacle,
because they change Circumstances,

78
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,905
so they can really bone your casting.

79
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:24,974
When you're factoring
the position of the Pleiades,

80
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:26,509
you want to keep in mind...

81
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,878
Whoa!

82
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,247
Whoa.

83
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,883
Sorry, I just, uh, I'll leave you

84
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,934
in your little sewing circle.

85
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:38,922
There's a syllabus, Penny,

86
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,423
and you're supposed to be studying--

87
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:41,991
Haven't you heard-- haven't you--

88
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:43,493
You're supposed to be studying
Astral Projection.

89
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:44,562
Now, here is what I know.

90
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:46,195
I fell like less of a pussy

91
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,298
if I don't cower in fear
of my own ability.

92
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,099
I mean, if I supposed to ever
be able to travel,

93
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,469
like really Travel between worlds,
I need to...

94
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:57,140
I need to be able to master this
Earth-bound small potato shit first.

95
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:59,309
Is something else going on?

96
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,580
I know that you were...
close with Kady.

97
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,281
Not as close as you'd think.

98
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,762
You know I-I have a great idea.

99
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,793
I mean, you're so worried about me,

100
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:20,163
why don't you come Travel with me?

101
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:22,966
You teach me...

102
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:27,036
and I know there's a few things
I can teach you, too.

103
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:34,377
I don't... think that...
would be appropriate.

104
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,380
Oh, I totally agree.

105
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,581
When do we leave?

106
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,454
You're going to be late
for your next class.

107
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:52,462
<i>Your first semester
with Brakebills</i>

108
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,865
was dedicated to learning
the fundamentals of magic.

109
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,334
We gave you the tools.

110
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:01,404
Now, it is time for you
to use them.

111
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:02,905
Look inside your bags.

112
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,941
Starting today,

113
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,909
your course load will double.

114
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:10,013
Alchemy, astronomy, botany,

115
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:11,280
just to name a few.

116
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:14,384
Study groups are mandatory.

117
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:21,183
Gretchen!

118
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:25,962
Hey, uh, so I heard that you sleep

119
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:29,599
with Mister Spock body pillow.

120
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,967
No judgment. I just, um,

121
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,469
I myself I have a full collection

122
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,774
of Leonard Nimoy's spoken word albums.
On vinyl.

123
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,142
You interested?

124
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,346
Quentin, what are you--

125
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:46,416
Gretchen, well,
basically begged me

126
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:50,420
to switch groups with her
and, uh, sorry.

127
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:51,954
I wore extra deodorant, though.

128
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:56,159
Yeah. It's strong.

129
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,461
So, are we the whole
study group?

130
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,668
Hell is real...

131
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,638
and it smells like
Axe Body Spray.

132
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:51,440
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by basiadora</font>

133

Who's your pen pal?

139
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:07,301
Leave before I start screaming.

140
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:10,972
Easy.
I just came here to talk.

141
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:14,642
I'd say let's grab a drink
and hash shit out, but...

142
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,344
I feel like
that's a no-no here.

143
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:18,646
Why don't you talk about
what you did to Hannah.

144
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,015
I was protecting myself
from a thief

145
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:22,950
and I wish I hadn't been put
in that position.

146
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:28,389
Is this an amends letter?

147
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,159
Yes. Some of us are capable
of making them.

148
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:34,061
Okay.

149
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:36,797
Try this.

150
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:41,068
I'm sorry, Julia.

151
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:46,107
I don't let in a lot of people.

152
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,476
And the ones I do...

153
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:53,214
it's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit thing happening.

154
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:57,318
I actually like you.

155
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,153
And this?

156
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:02,757
This is not what I wanted.

157
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:04,458
You mean what you wrote?

158
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,995
You're giving it up?

159
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:13,234
Well, let's short circuit
this whole thing.

160
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:14,769
You stay out of my ass

161
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,705
and there is no blood feud
necessary on my end.

162
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,610
But come after me,

163
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,714
and I will kill you and everyone
that you care about.

164
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:30,184
Well, the ones that are left,
anyway.

165
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,390
Such a bitch.

166
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,891
And you're weak.

167
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,226
Why apologize to him?

168
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:43,130
He's the one who should be
in here, not you.

169
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,867
Take your time, Professor.

170
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,246
You're good to go.

171
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,349
Okay, Henry.

172
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,550
Go ahead and try something.

173
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:14,795
Take it slow.

174
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,931
Okay.

175
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,066
It might take a few tries,
Henry.

176
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,902
There are physical therapy
exercises --

177
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,805
When I was four years old,

178
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:29,143
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

179
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:32,413
I taught myself magic.

180
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:35,082
I will do so again.

181
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,819
This is a disaster!

182
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,623
- What's wrong?
- I have nothing to wear.

183
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:46,160
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

184
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:49,930
I am not emotionally prepared
for Mike

185
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,932
to see me repeat outfits.

186
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,601
I think this might be
a Margo problem.

187
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:55,870
Obviously, Quentin,
but she shacked up

188
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,805
with some<i> artiste</i>
at Encanto Octulo,

189
00:11:57,906 --> 00:12:01,709
and, so, I'm stuck with you.

190
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,878
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

191
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:07,415
I made a horrible mistake
asking you to help.

192
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:08,749
Please, leave.

193
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,153
I was here first.

194
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:15,489
I've never really seen you
care about something.

195
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,758
Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

196
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,662
With some limited,
but very important exceptions.

197
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:23,898
Very limited.

198
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:28,068
But seriously, leave.

199
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:35,242
And for those who don't know
me way too well already,

200
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,944
I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here

201
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:40,948
and I will try to make my thing
today brief.

202
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,451
No matter why you started using,

203
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:46,720
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

204
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:49,890
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

205
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,794
but the one thing that won't
have changed is you.

206
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,333
Same head, same heart,
same mistakes.

207
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:00,734
Now, we don't like to hear it,

208
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:04,104
but we need something
or someone to lean on

209
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:06,240
that is bigger than ourselves.

210
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:07,775
Just say it.

211
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,276
God.

212
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:11,712
Well, that's one way
to putting it.

213
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,814
You know, there is a word

214
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:17,117
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

215
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,955
Replacing drugs or booze
or porn,

216
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,456
or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

217
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:24,358
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

218
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,127
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

219
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,497
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

220
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:33,167
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

221
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:37,638
Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

222
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,840
You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

223
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:43,744
Give a man hope and a nickel,
you got a nickel.

224
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:46,780
- Who said that?
- Some dick.

225
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,450
Wow!

226
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,452
So, what do you believe in?

227
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:53,754
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

228
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:56,490
but something bigger than you.

229
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,198
I don't understand.

230
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,033
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

231
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,769
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

232
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,404
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

233
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,473
if we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

234
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:16,176
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

235
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:18,445
It's a healing spell.
I've seen that

236
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:19,947
welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

237
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,415
Actually, trick question.

238
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:24,018
It's a<i> welwitschia mirabilis,</i>

239
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,253
the leaves are used for both,
healing spells

240
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,055
and for doing exotic curses.

241
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,791
I thought it was a fern.

242
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,194
Which is why I brought
flash cards.

243
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,460
Of course you did.

244
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,197
Thank you, Alice.

245
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,934
Could you not--
Could you-- for one minute,

246
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,268
could you not give her
googly eye?

247
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,436
Oh, God.

248
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:44,038
I don't know what you're,

249
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,607
uh, implying or, um, inferring.

250
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,909
Brakebills South didn't have
a lot of things.

251
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,646
Livable weather, edible food,
cable TV,

252
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,582
but you know what it did have?

253
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:57,151
Windows.

254
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:59,587
So if you don't know
and saw your little--

255
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,489
little extracurricular
activities,

256
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,825
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

257
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,427
I was above average for a fox.

258
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:09,930
Okay, I've studied enough
for one day.

259
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:11,865
Thank you for that.

260
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:15,235
It ain't my fault,
or my problem.

261
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:16,770
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

262
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:20,207
I don't need your help.

263
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,009
But if I hypothetically did--

264
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,112
Man, you act like a stalker

265
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:29,083
and then go out of your way
to deny that you're interested.

266
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:30,751
Either, grow a pair

267
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,420
or she'll find someone
who already did.

268
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:37,458
- Wow!
- Not done.

269
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,895
Only downside is,

270
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:45,165
it burns off all the alcohol.

271
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,668
Looks amazing.

272
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,170
Yeah, you don't have to kill
yourself for me.

273
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,840
It was no trouble.

274
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:57,711
I'm--I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

275
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,546
And, I mean, I feel like

276
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,616
I should be doing stuff
like this for you, but...

277
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:07,174
- I don't really know how.
- Don't be silly.

278
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:11,025
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

279
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,127
where I start to bore you.

280
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:14,015
You don't bore me.

281
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:15,398
I don't think
that you could bore me.

282
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:19,133
I don't know
about music and wine,

283
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,670
and frankly any country
not named Texas.

284
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:24,571
Texas is a state.

285
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,358
Not when you're from Texas.

286
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,775
Um...

287
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:32,012
Come here.

288
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,756
Where do you think I come from?

289
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,624
I don't know.

290
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,015
Someplace with money?

291
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,783
Well, um, we did have money.

292
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:50,819
Until grandmama gambled it
all away

293
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,123
and now, all we have is titles.

294
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:57,326
Sorry.
Um, that was a joke.

295
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:03,265
I was...

296
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:06,201
born in Indiana...

297
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,504
on a farm.

298
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:12,608
My parents are farmers.

299
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,943
Indiana? I--

300
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,211
I thought you--

301
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:19,515
Of course you did.

302
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:24,720
Becoming me was the greatest
creative project of my life.

303
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,588
So...

304
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,425
FYI, no one else here knows,
except for Margo,

305
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:33,562
and that's only because she was
my secret partner in the Trials.

306
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:36,332
Everyone else, I...

307
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,133
kind of let them go on thinking

308
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:41,770
I grew up summering
with Kennedys, etcetera.

309
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:48,811
Thank you.

310
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:50,913
For what?

311
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:52,881
Just you.

312
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:58,554
Um, well...

313
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,258
Here I am.

314
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,827
Yeah.

315
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:08,464
Here you are.

316
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,432
- Hi.
- Hey.

317
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,097
I checked the position
of Cephus three times,

318
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:44,633
I did the whole invocation,

319
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:49,438
this stupid plant should be
seven feet tall by now.

320
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,407
What?

321
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,412
What happened to you and Kady?

322
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,747
You guys were inseparable.

323
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:00,616
She gets through the Trials,

324
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:03,619
passes all of Mayakovsky's test
and then she's just--

325
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,655
She didn't give me an itinerary.

326
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:08,424
Man, I don't get it.

327
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:11,794
You act like you're
this panty-whisperer,

328
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,297
and your girl disappears and you
don't even know where she is.

329
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:15,664
You see her,

330
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:19,501
tell her she owes me 20 bucks.

331
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,637
Can I help you?

332
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:23,939
- What?
- Not you.

333
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,542
Ah, hey, Mike.

334
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:29,044
Sorry. I got--I got
a little turned around.

335
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:31,980
Um, could you tell me which way
the cottage is?

336
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,515
Yeah. It's like--

337
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,454
Oh, shit.

338
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,439
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

339
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,174
Whoa!

340
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:02,641
Help!
Help! Somebody help!

341
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,565
Get a transfusion ready,
get the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.

342
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:10,186
- Can you mend the wound?
- It's deep, but it's not impossible.

343
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,753
The weapon. We need the weapon.
Quentin...

344
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,110
- Mike. Mike has it.
- I need to see the knife to know.

345
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,344
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
- To know what?

346
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:16,913
Find him. Now.

347
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:21,450
Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

348
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,454
He was trying to kill me
before Penny jumped in the way.

349
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,623
Could it have anything
to do with the Beast?

350
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,757
Why would it?

351
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:30,961
Because it makes more sense
than somebody new trying to kill me.

352
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,296
Well, right now
there are far too many possibilities.

353
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,865
We will certainly ask Mr. McCormick
when we find him.

354
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,806
Quentin.

355
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,607
Is Penny okay?

356
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,777
Uh, he's in surgery. I don't know.

357
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,879
I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

358
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,116
I would've told you, but Fogg wouldn't
let us leave the building until...

359
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,652
- Until they find Mike.
- They did find him.

360
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,215
Prof. Sunderland and March found him
trying to open a portal

361
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:00,522
near the Welters stadium.

362
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:05,067
Where are they taking him?

363
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:09,630
Have you ever been
in this room before?

364
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,368
It was designed
at the turn of the century

365
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:16,773
for a set of incredibly
delicate experiments.

366
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,643
Mechanism within the walls,
prevent any spell casting,

367
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:22,958
it is, in fact, a clean room.

368
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:28,518
It was not intended for this...
this purpose, but it will do.

369
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,054
Where is the weapon?

370
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,056
- ...That you used?
- I don't know.

371
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:36,459
Were you specifically targeting Penny?
Quentin?

372
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,662
I was in Brooklyn!

373
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,831
Then I was here.
I don't know!

374
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,600
- Professor...
- Dean.

375
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:46,336
Henry, look I--

376
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,040
Okay.

377
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,608
Okay, look.

378
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,877
Look, you know me, right?

379
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,079
I was your student
for three years,

380
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,315
- you know that I couldn't.
- I know you did!

381
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,653
No, you can't go in there.

382
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,588
What did he say?

383
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,657
Nothing useful.

384
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:09,226
You're just gonna leave him
in there?

385
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,393
I'm not letting him go.

386
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:11,995
No, I mean, that's inhumane.

387
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:14,098
There is procedures
for dealing with magical crimes.

388
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:15,432
A circuit court system.

389
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,067
They're sending
in a representative.

390
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:18,768
- What will they do with him?
- They have facilities.

391
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,438
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

392
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,573
- On what?
- On whether Penny lives.

393
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,575
This reeks of mind control.

394
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:27,411
Wait. There was something...
wrong with his eyes.

395
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,447
They weren't entirely human,
that--that could be--

396
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,681
I looked in every scenario
there is to think of.

397
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:33,950
Spell gone wrong, doppelganger,

398
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,119
and yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

399
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,189
But there was always the chance
that he did this,

400
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,357
intentionally.

401
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,362
Good morning.

402
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:47,697
Pain killers.

403
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:49,232
Would be nice.

404
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,000
Your surgery
was very successful.

405
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:52,902
Your wounds are closed.

406
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,004
Just one or two weeks of--

407
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,841
Hey! You're not ready
to walk around yet.

408
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,576
I was stabbed, woman,

409
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,911
I'm gonna find
the motherfucker who--

410
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:03,847
Get Professor Lipson down here!

411
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:12,689
What?

412
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,397
It's spreading too quickly
to be an infection.

413
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:20,285
The wound is cursed. Whatever it is,
it's growing under the skin.

414
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:21,988
He's lucky it's not near
any vital organs.

415
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,356
- The necrotizing tissue--
- Necrotizing?

416
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:26,425
Cell death within the tissue.

417
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:27,861
If it touches
something important--

418
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:29,495
How do you fix it?

419
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:32,231
Without seeing the knife I...

420
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:33,899
I have no idea.

421
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,667
I hate magic.

422
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:37,002
I mean, why us?

423
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:38,904
You, I get.

424
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:40,739
I think about stabbing you
all the time.

425
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:45,544
That was a 100% not a joke.

426
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,846
You realized that knife
was coming at me

427
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:50,649
before you jump in the way of it,
right?

428
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,019
I owe you, like,
a Wookie Life Debt.

429
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,210
Get a knife.
I'll stab you right now.

430
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,297
I keep thinking--

431
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:08,367
- The Beast.
- It makes sense.

432
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:10,969
And yet it doesn't.

433
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:13,038
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

434
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:14,831
Yeah.

435
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,110
Hey, do you want me to--

436
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:19,812
Is there anyone you want me
to call?

437
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:21,980
Parents, siblings,

438
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:24,383
parole officer?

439
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:27,319
I'm good.

440
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,787
No, Quentin.

441
00:24:28,888 --> 00:24:30,856
She cared, she'd be here.

442
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,197
No visitors.

443
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:39,364
Two minutes.

444
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,599
What could he possibly say

445
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,767
that would make you feel
any better?

446
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:43,936
I'm not here to feel better.

447
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:48,006
Please.

448
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:52,878
I was supposed to have
a date last night.

449
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:55,481
I got all dressed up.

450
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:58,951
I'm sorry.

451
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:03,822
All this stuff they're saying
I did, I don't remember.

452
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:06,425
You were blacked out.

453
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:15,467
Were you blacked out
when we met?

454
00:25:29,782 --> 00:25:31,084
No, I don't want to buy a bible.

455
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:39,758
What safe house were you in?

456
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:42,127
I recognized your ink.

457
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:45,831
You see it more often than you'd
think in a place like this.

458
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:46,832
You're a Hedge?

459
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,300
No.

460
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:50,269
Classically trained, myself.

461
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,174
There's a special school,
called Brakebills.

462
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:58,010
You heard of it?

463
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:01,446
Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

464
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:04,283
in here to get away
from magic, so...

465
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:07,352
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

466
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:10,956
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

467
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:13,759
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

468
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,060
It's a gift.

469
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:17,462
Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

470
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:19,131
I'm not the guy outside of YMCA

471
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:20,365
yelling at people to repent.

472
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,467
Then what are you, Richard?

473
00:26:24,404 --> 00:26:28,073
Okay, what we call magic is,

474
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:30,142
a set of tools.

475
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,077
Leftover from Creation.

476
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:33,712
Think about it.

477
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,981
The power to bend reality

478
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:37,816
to make and unmake.

479
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,119
Won't God be pissed we touched
His tools without asking?

480
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:47,593
God--
gods, really,

481
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:50,195
they don't do things
by accident.

482
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:52,798
The tools were left for us
to find.

483
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,433
Right.

484
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:57,769
But...

485
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,972
what I'm saying,

486
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:01,707
you don't have to take
my word for it.

487
00:27:05,411 --> 00:27:07,579
See it for yourself.

488
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,024
<i>Please!</i>

489
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:23,996
Penny?

490
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:26,365
It's just a headache.

491
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,500
I brought you your homework.

492
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:31,303
- Why?
- Fair point.

493
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:34,039
But if you were me, I'd be glad
to talk to somebody else

494
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,174
who wasn't a Healing Student.

495
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:38,243
And since Kady's not here...

496
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,880
Oh, this is pity.

497
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:44,516
No.

498
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:45,884
Well, kind of.

499
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:48,454
I mean, she had shit to do elsewhere.
It's-- I'm good.

500
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:49,821
- Great.
- I am.

501
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,584
I said great.

502
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,592
I get it.

503
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:56,595
People are generally
disappointing.

504
00:27:56,696 --> 00:28:00,499
Yeah, be ready to pull a ripcord
at a moment's notice.

505
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,368
Like if you're messing around
with some loser who...

506
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:07,439
too obsessed with kid's books
to acknowledge he even sees you.

507
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,875
Ripcord.

508
00:28:13,313 --> 00:28:15,747
Are you okay?

509
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:18,317
Can I do anything to help?

510
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,888
You want to help me,

511
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:24,923
go to my room

512
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:28,442
and find the bag of pills
that's stashed under my desk.

513
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:30,744
- Pills for what?
- For... I'm a Traveler freak

514
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:34,266
who hears voices and I do a little
or a lot of self-medicating

515
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:37,436
to get them to shut
their scream-holes.

516
00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:38,937
Penny.

517
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:40,906
Alice, I don't need any judgment.

518
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,808
No, Penny.

519
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:44,743
Oh, okay.

520
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,348
Hey, look.

521
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,519
That's--that's not great.

522
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,321
Can someone get Quentin?

523
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:57,789
Now!

524
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,158
This is not what I pictured.

525
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:02,561
It's from the fourth
Fillory book.

526
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:04,830
I read them all for research.

527
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:08,583
Yeah, Jane, she was alone
in Fillory for the first time

528
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,538
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

529
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:12,389
- What's Lorian?
- They're the bad guys.

530
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:14,973
Uh, from a neighboring kingdom.
It's actually really interesting,

531
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:17,802
because Fillory is both, the name
of the landmass and also the one of

532
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,913
- the sovereign states...
- Quentin, focus, please.

533
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,048
Ah, yeah.

534
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:25,716
Ah, um, so the Lorian, uh...

535
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:29,155
stabbed Jane
with something called the Virgo Blade.

536
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:32,090
And, uh,
rose vines grew from the wounds

537
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:37,396
This seems to be the way grosser,
less whimsical version of that.

538
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,765
Um, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

539
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,133
Honeyclaw?

540
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:43,101
- Yeah. A-a talking bear.
- Oh, Jesus.

541
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:45,398
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

542
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:49,340
until they strangled her heart,
um, but Jane survived.

543
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:53,011
Penny, I know how to fix this.

544
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:58,270
Is that a turban?

545
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:00,164
No, it's your hair.

546
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:02,991
Sewing is not really my thing.

547
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,878
How is a voodoo doll
is supposed to help me?

548
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:07,746
Um, so, in the books,

549
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,349
Jane carried this doll with her
everywhere she goes,

550
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,351
and it looks just like her.

551
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:15,787
And so they realized
that the curse

552
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:19,091
of the Virgo Blade would accept
the doll as a substitute.

553
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,362
So, we burn a doll?

554
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,437
Okay, what else did your dumb
book says?

555
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:52,453
Henry.

556
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:56,094
It is considered good form
to announce oneself to blind people.

557
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,299
My glasses only show me
your outline...vaguely.

558
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,302
In my defense, I was raised
by wolves for a time.

559
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:05,472
The knife
that Penny was stabbed with...

560
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,173
is from Fillory.

561
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:11,478
Something called the-the Virgo Blade.

562
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,647
- And you're familiar?
- Yes.

563
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:16,149
This is a first.

564
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,885
You should've called for me
much sooner.

565
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:22,188
Quentin's the most at risk,
but if Penny dies...

566
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,058
This is your mess, Eliza.

567
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:28,561
Clean it up.

568
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:34,401
Then, get as far away
from my university as possible.

569
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:36,803
Do you understand?

570
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:45,045
Mr. Coldwater, I don't have
a lot of time at the moment.

571
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:46,579
It is the Beast, isn't it?

572
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,548
And he's from Fillory, which is real.

573
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:51,818
Of course Fillory is real. You've
known that since you were a child.

574
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,787
It's why you're here.

575
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:56,056
Okay, but there's no Beast
in the books.

576
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:58,892
The books are
a child's drawing of Fillory.

577
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:01,261
The real thing is stranger.

578
00:32:01,362 --> 00:32:01,950
Yeah,

579
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,731
it's full of psychopathic monsters
who are trying to kill me.

580
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:06,334
You want to know
what the Beast wants?

581
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:07,767
I'll tell you exactly.

582
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:09,736
He wants control of Fillory

583
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:11,271
and all the doors
that lead there.

584
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:15,041
Maybe, he thinks
you'll find one of them.

585
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,811
- I'm not a Traveler.
- There are other ways.

586
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:19,312
I gave you a book about it.

587
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,448
"Fillory and Further, Book Six"?

588
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:22,615
I told you.
I lost it.

589
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:25,352
And nothing lost was ever found?

590
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,020
Wait, there's, uh--
What about Penny?

591
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:28,388
There's got to be
something we can do.

592
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:31,124
You need to read between
the lines, Quentin.

593
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:35,028
Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

594
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:38,064
Was special because
of where it came from.

595
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,067
<i>Jane's mother gave it to her...</i>

596
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,169
<i>before she died.</i>

597
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:48,775
<i>It was all she took with her
to Fillory.</i>

598
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,612
<i>Her only reminder of her family
and her life on Earth.</i>

599
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:56,449
<i>It was her most precious
possession.</i>

600
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,086
<i>What we love can be as
important to us as our lives.</i>

601
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,723
So, the curse accepted the doll

602
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:06,693
as a proper sacrifice
in place of Jane's heart.

603
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:12,031
I know you have more questions

604
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,734
after you save your friend.

605
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,473
I found a way to break
the curse,

606
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:22,675
I just need a--
Penny!

607
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:25,912
Hey, asshole, I need to know
your most precious possession.

608
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,081
He's been out of it for like,
20 minutes.

609
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,085
Then, it's too late.

610
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:52,839
I beseech and devote myself.

611
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:57,710
I plead and promise myself...

612
00:33:57,812 --> 00:33:59,579
to you,

613
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,915
She of the Grain,

614
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:05,819
that you would raise me
up above the chaff.

615
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:09,689
Amen?

616
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,157
<i>♪ You can still be ♪</i>

617
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,193
<i>♪ What you want to</i> ♪

618
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:15,595
<i>♪</i> What you said you were ♪

619
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:18,097
<i>♪</i> What you know you are ♪

620
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:27,540
<i>♪ When I met you ♪</i>

621
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:31,744
<i>♪ You ♪</i>

622
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:35,114
<i>♪ You ♪</i>

623
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:39,285
<i>♪ You ♪</i>

624
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:42,486
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

625
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:44,026
I don't know. Penny doesn't
have that much stuff,

626
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:47,430
we'll just go through it.

627
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:51,247
Pictures.
Yeah, maybe it's something

628
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:52,681
from his childhood, his family.

629
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:54,283
He doesn't ever talk about them.

630
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,618
Doesn't mean he doesn't care
about them.

631
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,453
Penny's not
the most sentimental type.

632
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,588
Well, maybe he carefully
crafts that image,

633
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,457
I don't know.
Everyone is sentimental.

634
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,226
- You're projecting.
- You're projecting!

635
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,264
Okay.

636
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:10,866
I'm getting a definite
circus clown vibe here.

637
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:12,735
Q, this is it.

638
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,371
You think, Penny's most prized
possession is his Adderall?

639
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:17,139
I have voices telling me,
all day long,

640
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,741
to do dark magic
and I don't know,

641
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:20,576
the pills were the one thing
that make them stop,

642
00:35:20,677 --> 00:35:22,278
- they'd be pretty precious.
- You can always get more pills.

643
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:23,746
They're fungible.

644
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,147
You're fungible.

645
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,683
Okay, what's yours, hmm?

646
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:30,354
That's kind of a personal question
for two people

647
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:32,874
who aren't supposed to be
in the same room?

648
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:35,589
What's yours?

649
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,860
A quilt that my grandmother
made me when I was little.

650
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:44,765
It's covered in cats.

651
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:49,336
"Fillory and Further",
book one, first edition.

652
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:52,005
I worked all summer
before eight grade to get it.

653
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:54,641
It's predictable I know.

654
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,443
Predictable's not bad, Quentin.

655
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,419
Hey.

656
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,921
What about this?

657
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,823
A candy bar wrapper?

658
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:11,059
It's from Brakebills South.

659
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:13,060
This is the last place
that he saw Kady.

660
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:16,263
Quentin, I don't think Penny
even cares that she's gone.

661
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:18,865
Believe me.

662
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,334
He does.

663
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:52,432
What was that?
That you gave me?

664
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,001
Did it work?

665
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:56,069
It didn't feel like
I was doing a casting,

666
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,072
it felt like a casting
was being done on me.

667
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,575
It's because it's not a spell,
it was a prayer.

668
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,611
- To what?
- Local harvest deity.

669
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:06,380
Friendly,
but a little one-trick.

670
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,548
You're lucky she answered.
She's pretty shy.

671
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,451
It's like touching a bare wire.

672
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,820
More energy than I've felt.

673
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,988
It felt good.

674
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:17,658
It felt...dangerous.

675
00:37:20,662 --> 00:37:23,664
The reason you treat magic
like a drug,

676
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:25,499
is because the people
that taught it to you

677
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
act like drug dealers.

678
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:28,735
They buy it and they sell it,

679
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:31,705
and they fight
and they fuck for it.

680
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:34,975
Well, that's not
the only way to live.

681
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,644
That's the only way
I've ever seen.

682
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:41,348
I'm a very good Magician

683
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:43,884
and I do this.

684
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:46,053
There are good people
out there, Julia.

685
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:47,688
People trying to learn
about the world

686
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:49,456
and make it a better place.

687
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:51,425
Now, you can be
one of those people,

688
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,927
you can be a dealer,

689
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:57,197
you can stay here
and be nothing.

690
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,535
You get to choose.

691
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:13,180
If I give you something,

692
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:15,749
you think you can get it
into Brakebills for me?

693
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,954
Don't bother
with the performance.

694
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,957
Even with these wards,
I can see right through you.

695
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:26,326
I wouldn't dream of fooling you.

696
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:28,795
I have far bigger dreams
than that.

697
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:31,198
Very clever,
targeting someone else

698
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:32,799
outside the campus protections.

699
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,302
Graduate with an alumni key.

700
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:39,005
Attractive to a certain sort.

701
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,107
It won't work next time.

702
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,475
There won't be a next time.

703
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:43,210
You can't hide
in Fillory forever.

704
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:44,945
Lock as many doors as you want,

705
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,147
there's always a door to Fillory
when you need one.

706
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:48,849
Nothing's changed.

707
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,886
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

708
00:38:52,987 --> 00:38:55,222
No, I never wanted this.

709
00:38:55,323 --> 00:38:58,725
You forced my hand.
I wish I could be any other way.

710
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:02,562
I picked the Virgo Blade,
specially for you, Jane.

711
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:04,531
Little twinge of nostalgia.

712
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:08,001
Penny's going to live
and this meat puppet of yours

713
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:10,437
is going to a Salvadorian prison
in the morning.

714
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:12,339
All that scheming, wasted.

715
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,775
I could walk out of here
anytime I like.

716
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:18,178
If you can leave anytime,
what are you waiting for?

717
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:21,248
Oh, I was waiting...

718
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:22,716
for you.

719
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:29,421
Help me!

720
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,621
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait.

721
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:51,236
Dean Fogg.

722
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:56,741
What do we do?

723
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:00,845
What do we do?

724
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:02,814
I don't--I don't know.

725
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:04,449
Fuck that.

726
00:41:06,418 --> 00:41:08,620
Eliza is dead. I--

727
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:11,322
When the Beast comes back,
what are we su--

728
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:13,892
She is the only one who could
actually give me answers.

729
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:17,629
There are no answers, Quentin.

730
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,367
Because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

731
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:25,837
Most likely outcome:

732
00:41:25,938 --> 00:41:27,572
The Beast comes back.

733
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:32,277
Specially now that he's gotten
Eliza out of the way.

734
00:41:32,378 --> 00:41:34,179
You die,

735
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,714
your friends die,

736
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:39,117
we all die

737
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:41,352
very bloody.

738
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:47,392
And all of this,

739
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:50,562
will have been for nothing.

740
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:02,974
Are you okay?

741
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:39,299
