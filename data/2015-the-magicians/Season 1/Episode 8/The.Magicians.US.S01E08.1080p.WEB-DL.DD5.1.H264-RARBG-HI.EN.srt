Well, that's one way

You know, there is a word

That is a bummer way

the world for what actually is.

Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

257

what the spell does.

we'll be here all night.

Of course you did.

Thank you, Alice.

00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:15,544
and your girl disappears and you
don't even know where she is.

360
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:16,873
You see her,

361
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:20,710
tell her she owes me 20 bucks.

362
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,846
Can I help you?

363
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:25,148
- What?
- Not you.

364
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,751
Ah, hey, Mike.

365
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:30,253
Sorry. I got... I got
a little turned around.

366
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:33,189
Um, could you tell me which way
the cottage is?

367
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,724
Yeah. It's like...

Get a transfusion ready, get

Can you mend the wound?

377
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,330
It's deep,
but it's not impossible.

378
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:11,632
The weapon. We need the weapon.

- Mike. Mike has it.

Find him. Now.

383
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:21,341
Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

He was trying to kill me

Why would it?

387
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:28,949
Because it makes more sense

388
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,851
than somebody new
try to kill me.

389
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:33,187
Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

390

Mr. McCormick when we find him.

Uh, he's in surgery.
I don't know.

Everyone's really scared.

- They did find him.

delicate experiments.

it is, in fact, a clean room.

406
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:26,907
It was not intended
for this... this purpose,

407
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:28,809
but it will do.

408
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,245
Where is the weapon...

409
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:33,247
- that you used?
- I don't know.

410
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:36,650
Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

411
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,853
I was in Brooklyn.

412
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:42,022
Then I was here. I don't know!

Look, you know me, right?

418
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,170
I was your student
for three years,

419
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,406
- you know that I couldn't.
- I know you did!

420
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,744
No, you can't go in there.

421
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:05,679
What did he say?

422
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,748
Nothing useful.

423
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:09,369
You're just gonna leave him
in there?

424
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,484
I'm not letting him go.

425
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:12,086
No, I mean, that's inhumane.

426
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:14,227
There is procedures
for dealing with magical crimes.

427
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,523
A circuit court system.

428
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,158
They're sending
in a representative.

429
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,859
- What will they do with him?
- They have facilities.

430
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,529
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

431
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,664
- On what?
- On whether Penny lives.

432
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:25,666
This reeks of mind control.

433
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:27,567
Wait. There was something
wrong with his eyes.

434
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:29,562
They weren't entirely human,
that... that could be...

435
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,772

there is to think of.

and yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

438
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:39,280
But there was always the chance
that he did this,

439
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:41,448
intentionally.

00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:46,453

Your wounds are closed.

Just one or two weeks of...

446
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:57,932
Hey! You're not ready
to walk around yet.

It's spreading too quickly
to be an infection.

454

The wound is cursed.

455
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:19,487
Whatever it is,
is growing under the skin.

456
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,229
He's lucky it's not near
any vital organs.

457
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,558
- The necrotizing tissue...
- Necrotizing?

458
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,627
Cell death within the tissue.

something important...

of it, right?

- The Beast.
- It makes sense.

to call?

No, I don't want to buy a bible.

You heard of it?

508
00:25:57,313 --> 00:26:00,648
Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

509
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,485
in here to get away
from magic, so...

510
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:06,554
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

511
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:10,158
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

512
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:12,961
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

513
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:14,262
It's a gift.

Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

517
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:21,669
Then what are you, Richard?

518
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:27,275
Okay, what we call magic is,

519
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:29,344
a set of tools.

520
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:31,279
Leftover from Creation.

521
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,914
Think about it.

522
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,183
- [scoffs]
- The power to bend reality

523
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:37,018
to make and unmake.

524
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,321
Won't God be pissed we touched
His tools without asking?

they don't do things
by accident.

527
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:52,000
The tools were left for us
to find.

528
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:53,635
Right.

529
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:56,971

- Yeah. A-a talking bear.
- Oh, Jesus.

Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:48,642

Jane carried this doll with her

00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:12,153

605

that the curse
