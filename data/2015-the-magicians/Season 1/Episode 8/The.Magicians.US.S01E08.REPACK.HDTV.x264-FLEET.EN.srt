00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,625
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,094
Let's just net this
all in the bud.

3
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:05,415
You were the paramedic.

4
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,250
Call me Eliza.
I was there that day

5
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,419
to make sure that you got here.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,789
- We flew here to Antarctica?
- So what is this then?

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,557
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

8
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:18,161
Remove your clothes.
Do it!

9
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,799
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

10
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,304
They know everything
at Brakebills, what you've done.

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,839
You cannot go back.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,908
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,276
Run.

14
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:38,815
You can't keep going like this.

15
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,117
I called a place.
They can take you tomorrow.

16
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,852
A "place"?

17
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,854
- Mike.
- Eliot.

18
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,756
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:24,660
It's a little something
I invented.

20
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:26,229
Oh.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,297
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

22
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,566
A beer?

23
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,102
You are lucky you're pretty.

24
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,937
Eliot.

25
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,273
You're back.

26
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,242
Hooray!

27
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,810
Oh, thank God.

28
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,671
How do you always have drinks
waiting for us?

29
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:48,551
Oh, just a good host, I guess.

30
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,387
Guys, this is my friend Mike.

31
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,890
He graduated a few years ago
and lives in New York,

32
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,825
and Margo tried to kill him
with a Djinn,

33
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:57,126
but we fixed it.

34
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,928
This is Alice, that's Quentin.

35
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,663
- They are nerds.
- I could kind of tell.

36
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,466
How was Brakebills South?
Did anyone freeze to death?

37
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,835
Oh, I mean, it was--

38
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:08,771
it was eventful.
I--

39
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:12,141
Why is your face
making that face?

40
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,311
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,513
- They totally had sex.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:18,815
- No, nothing happened.
- I mean, it just happened.

43
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,349
Let me guess.

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,090
You got drunk
on Mayakovsky's lichen vodka

45
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,452
and you seduced him.

46
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:25,221
Maybe I seduced her.

47
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,390
Please. And sweetie,

48
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:30,526
getting drunk and porking
a dungeon master

49
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,727
is nothing to be a ashamed of.

50
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,995
Ah, porking?

51
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:34,397
I was looking at the pork butt.

52
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,532
I'm going to go take a nap

53
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,768
and pretend that this entire
conversation never happened.

54
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,269
Okay.

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,804
Ah, ah, I--

56
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,710
- Nice meeting you.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,512
Eyes on the pork butt, mister.

58
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:50,613
- He's pretty.
- I know.

59
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:51,914
But I called dibs on him.

60
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,288
Hey, ignore Eliot.
He's--

61
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,025
You know, just being Eliot.

62
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,430
Don't.

63
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,067
I thought "nap" was code.

64
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,173
Can we just talk about this
seriously for a second?

65
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:22,411
What we did was stress and
circumstances, and pheromones.

66
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,247
The first time,
but not the next four.

67
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:27,683
- You were...counting?
- Of course I was counting.

68
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,252
Maybe Eliot's right.

69
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,187
We might as well have been
drunk or high, or--

70
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,989
I'm not under the influence
right now.

71
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,858
Yes, we are, Q.

72
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,195
I can still smell you,
but like, fox you,

73
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,163
and I'm pretty sure you can
still smell me.

74
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,165
That could have
a lot to do with the fact

75
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,095
that we haven't bathed in weeks.

76
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,843
Are you in love with me?

77
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,427
I, uh--I don't know.

78
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,207
Even if you fell down
on your knees

79
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,576
and proclaimed your, you know.

80
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,479
I know it wasn't really you.

81
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,051
I think that we need to...
spend some time apart,

82
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,053
so we can know what's real
and what's fox.

83
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:14,063
<i>When they were lost,</i>

84
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,465
ancient sailors used the stars
to find their way,

85
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,234
but, for you,
they're an obstacle

86
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,369
because they change
Circumstances

87
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,305
so they can really bone
your casting.

88
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,374
When you're factoring
the position of the Pleiades--

89
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,909
You want to keep in mind--

90
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,278
Whoa!

91
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,647
Whoa.

92
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,283
Sorry, I just,
uh, I'll leave you--

93
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,653
in your little sewing circle.

94
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,322
There's a syllabus, Penny,

95
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,823
and you're supposed
to be studying--

96
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,391
Haven't you heard--
haven't you--

97
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:43,893
You're supposed to be studying
Astral Projection.

98
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:44,994
Now, here is what I know.

99
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,595
I fell like less of a pussy

100
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,698
if I don't cower in fear
of my own ability.

101
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,499
I mean, if I supposed to ever
be able to travel,

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,869
like really Travel
between worlds, I need--

103
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,251
I need to be able to master this

104
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,540
Earth-bound small potato
shit first.

105
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,709
Is something else going on?

106
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,980
I know that you were close
with Kady.

107
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,681
Not as close as you'd think.

108
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:15,157
You know I-I have a great idea.

109
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,193
I mean, you're so worried
about me,

110
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,563
why don't you come Travel
with me?

111
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,366
You teach me...

112
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,736
and I know there's a few things
I can teach you, too.

113
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:34,777
I don't think
that would be appropriate.

114
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,780
Oh, I totally agree.

115
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,981
When do we leave?

116
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:44,854
You're going to be late
for your next class.

117
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,862
<i>Your first semester
with Brakebills</i>

118
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:56,265
was dedicated to learning
the fundamentals of magic.

119
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,734
We gave you the tools.

120
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,804
Now, it is time for you
to use them.

121
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,305
Look inside your bags.

122
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,341
Starting today,

123
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:07,309
your course load will double.

124
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,413
Alchemy, astronomy, botany,

125
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,680
just to name a few.

126
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:14,784
Study groups are mandatory.

127
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:22,525
Gretchen.

128
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:26,362
Hey, uh, so I heard
that you sleep

129
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:29,999
with Mister Spock body pillow.

130
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,367
No judgment. I just, um,

131
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,869
I myself I have
a full collection

132
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,174
of Leonard Nimoy's spoken word
albums on vinyl.

133
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,542
You interested?

134
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,746
Quentin, what are you--

135
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,816
Gretchen, well,
basically begged me

136
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,820
to switch groups with her
and, uh, sorry.

137
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,354
I wore extra deodorant, though.

138
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:56,559
Yeah.
It's strong.

139
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,861
So, are we the whole
study group?

140
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,068
Hell is real...

141
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,038
and it smells like
Axe Body Spray.

Leave before I start screaming.

150
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:11,372
Easy.
I just came here to talk.

151
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:15,042
I'd say let's grab a drink
and hash shit out, but...

152
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,744
I feel like
that's a no-no here.

153
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,046
Why don't you talk about
what you did to Hannah.

154
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,415
I was protecting myself
from a thief

155
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,350
and I wish I hadn't been put
in that position.

156
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,789
Is this an amends letter?

157
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,559
Yes. Some of us are capable
of making them.

158
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,461
Okay.

159
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,197
Try this.

160
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:41,468
I'm sorry, Julia.

161
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:46,507
I don't let in a lot of people.

162
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,876
And the ones I do...

163
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:53,614
it's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit thing happening.

164
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,718
I actually like you.

165
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,553
And this?

166
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:03,157
This is not what I wanted.

167
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,858
You mean what you wrote?

168
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,395
You're giving it up?

169
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:13,634
Well, let's short circuit
this whole thing.

170
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,169
You stay out of my ass

171
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,105
and there is no blood feud
necessary on my end.

172
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,010
But come after me,

173
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:27,114
and I will kill you and everyone
that you care about.

174
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:30,584
Well, the ones that are left,
anyway.

175
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:35,856
Such a bitch.

176
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,291
And you're weak.

177
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:39,626
Why apologize to him?

178
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,530
He's the one who should be
in here, not you.

179
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,267
Take your time, Professor.

180
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:59,646
You're good to go.

181
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,749
Okay, Henry.

182
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,950
Go ahead and try something.

183
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:15,195
Take it slow.

184
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:17,331
Okay.

185
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,466
It might take a few tries,
Henry.

186
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:22,302
There are physical therapy
exercises --

187
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:25,205
When I was four years old,

188
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,543
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

189
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,813
I taught myself magic.

190
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:35,482
I will do so again.

191
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,219
This is a disaster!

192
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,023
- What's wrong?
- I have nothing to wear.

193
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:46,560
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

194
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,330
I am not emotionally prepared
for Mike

195
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:52,332
to see me repeat outfits.

196
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,001
I think this might be
a Margo problem.

197
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,270
Obviously, Quentin,
but she shacked up

198
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,205
with some<i> artiste</i>
at Encanto Octulo,

199
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:02,109
and, so, I'm stuck with you.

200
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,278
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

201
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,815
I made a horrible mistake
asking you to help.

202
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,149
Please, leave.

203
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,553
I was here first.

204
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,889
I've never really seen you
care about something.

205
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,158
Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

206
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,062
With some limited,
but very important exceptions.

207
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,298
Very limited.

208
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:28,468
But seriously, leave.

209
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:35,642
And for those who don't know
me way too well already,

210
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,344
I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here

211
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:41,348
and I will try to make my thing
today brief.

212
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,851
No matter why you started using,

213
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:47,120
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

214
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:50,290
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

215
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:54,194
but the one thing that won't
have changed is you.

216
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,733
Same head, same heart,
same mistakes.

217
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,134
Now, we don't like to hear it,

218
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:04,504
but we need something
or someone to lean on

219
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:06,640
that is bigger than ourselves.

220
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,175
Just say it.

221
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:09,676
God.

222
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,112
Well, that's one way
to putting it.

223
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,214
You know, there is a word

224
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,517
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

225
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,355
Replacing drugs or booze
or porn,

226
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,856
or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

227
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,758
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

228
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:27,527
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

229
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,897
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

230
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:33,567
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

231
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:38,038
Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

232
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,240
You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

233
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:44,144
Give a man hope and a nickel,
you got a nickel.

234
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,180
- Who said that?
- Some dick.

235
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,850
Wow!

236
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,852
So, what do you believe in?

237
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:54,154
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

238
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,890
but something bigger than you.

239
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,598
I don't understand.

240
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,433
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

241
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,174
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

242
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,804
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

243
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:12,873
if we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

244
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:16,576
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

245
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:18,845
It's a healing spell.
I've seen that

246
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,347
welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

247
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,815
Actually, trick question.

248
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,418
It's a<i> welwitschia mirabilis,</i>

249
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,653
the leaves are used for both,
healing spells

250
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:28,455
and for doing exotic curses.

251
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,191
I thought it was a fern.

252
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,652
Which is why I brought
flash cards.

253
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:33,860
Of course you did.

254
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,597
Thank you, Alice.

255
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,334
Could you not--
Could you-- for one minute,

256
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,668
could you not give her
googly eye?

257
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:42,836
Oh, God.

258
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,438
I don't know what you're,

259
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:47,007
uh, implying or, um, inferring.

260
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,309
Brakebills South didn't have
a lot of things.

261
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,046
Livable weather, edible food,
cable TV,

262
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,982
but you know what it did have?

263
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,551
Windows.

264
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,987
So if you don't know
and saw your little--

265
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:02,889
little extracurricular
activities,

266
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,225
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

267
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:06,827
I was above average for a fox.

268
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:10,330
Okay, I've studied enough
for one day.

269
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,265
Thank you for that.

270
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,635
It ain't my fault,
or my problem.

271
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,170
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

272
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,607
I don't need your help.

273
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,409
But if I hypothetically did--

274
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,512
Man, you act like a stalker

275
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:29,483
and then go out of your way
to deny that you're interested.

276
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,151
Either, grow a pair

277
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,820
or she'll find someone
who already did.

278
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,858
- Wow!
- Not done.

279
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,295
Only downside is,

280
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:45,565
it burns off all the alcohol.

281
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,068
Looks amazing.

282
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,570
Yeah, you don't have to kill
yourself for me.

283
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:53,240
It was no trouble.

284
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:58,111
I'm--I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

285
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,946
And, I mean, I feel like

286
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,016
I should be doing stuff
like this for you, but...

287
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:07,574
- I don't really know how.
- Don't be silly.

288
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:11,425
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

289
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,527
where I start to bore you.

290
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,415
You don't bore me.

291
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:15,798
I don't think
that you could bore me.

292
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:19,533
I don't know
about music and wine,

293
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,070
and frankly any country
not named Texas.

294
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,971
Texas is a state.

295
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,758
Not when you're from Texas.

296
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,175
Um...

297
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,412
Come here.

298
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,156
Where do you think I come from?

299
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,024
I don't know.

300
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:46,415
Someplace with money?

301
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,183
Well, um, we did have money.

302
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:51,219
Until grandmama gambled it
all away

303
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,523
and now, all we have is titles.

304
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,726
Sorry.
Um, that was a joke.

305
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:03,665
I was...

306
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:06,601
born in Indiana...

307
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,904
on a farm.

308
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:13,008
My parents are farmers.

309
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,343
Indiana? I--

310
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,611
I thought you--

311
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,915
Of course you did.

312
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:25,120
Becoming me was the greatest
creative project of my life.

313
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,988
So...

314
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,825
FYI, no one else here knows,
except for Margo,

315
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:33,962
and that's only because she was
my secret partner in the Trials.

316
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:36,732
Everyone else, I...

317
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,533
kind of let them go on thinking

318
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:42,170
I grew up summering
with Kennedys, etcetera.

319
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,211
Thank you.

320
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,313
For what?

321
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:53,281
Just you.

322
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,954
Um, well...

323
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,658
Here I am.

324
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,227
Yeah.

325
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,864
Here you are.

326
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,832
- Hi.
- Hey.

327
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,497
I checked the position
of Cephus three times,

328
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,033
I did the whole invocation,

329
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:49,838
this stupid plant should be
seven feet tall by now.

330
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,807
What?

331
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,812
What happened to you and Kady?

332
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,147
You guys were inseparable.

333
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:01,016
She gets through the Trials,

334
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:04,019
passes all of Mayakovsky's test
and then she's just--

335
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,055
She didn't give me an itinerary.

336
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,824
Man, I don't get it.

337
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,194
You act like you're
this panty-whisperer,

338
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:14,735
and your girl disappears and you
don't even know where she is.

339
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,064
You see her,

340
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,901
tell her she owes me 20 bucks.

341
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:22,037
Can I help you?

342
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,339
- What?
- Not you.

343
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,942
Ah, hey, Mike.

344
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,444
Sorry. I got--I got
a little turned around.

345
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,380
Um, could you tell me which way
the cottage is?

346
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,915
Yeah. It's like--

347
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,854
Oh, shit.

348
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,839
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

349
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,574
Whoa!

350
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,041
Help!
Help! Somebody help!

351
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:07,100
Get a transfusion ready, get
the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.

352
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,520
Can you mend the wound?

353
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,721
It's deep,
but it's not impossible.

354
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,023
The weapon.
We need the weapon.

355
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,157
- Quentin.
- Mike. Mike has it.

356
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,392
I need to see the knife to know.

357
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:14,626
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
- To know what?

358
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,195
Find him. Now.

359
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:20,732
Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

360
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,736
He was trying to kill me
before Penny jumped in the way.

361
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:25,905
Could have anything
to do with the Beast?

362
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,039
Why would it?

363
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,340
Because it makes more sense

364
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,242
than somebody new
try to kill me.

365
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,578
Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

366
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,147
We will certainly ask
Mr. McCormick when we find him.

367
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,388
Quentin.

368
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,623
Is Penny okay?

369
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:47,059
Uh, he's in surgery.
I don't know.

370
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,161
I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

371
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,022
I would've told you,
but Fogg wouldn't let us

372
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:52,398
leave the building until...

373
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,934
- Until they find Mike.
- They did find him.

374
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:57,195
Professor Sunderland and March
found him trying to open

375
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,104
a portal near
the Welters stadium.

376
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,277
Where are they taking him?

377
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:09,482
Have you ever been
in this room before?

378
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,650
It was designed at the turn
of the century

379
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:16,455
for a sect of incredibly
delicate experiments.

380
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:19,091
Mechanism within the walls,
prevent any spell casting,

381
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,995
it is, in fact, a clean room.

382
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:26,298
It was not intended
for this--this purpose,

383
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,200
but it will do.

384
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,636
Where is the weapon...

385
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,638
- that you used?
- I don't know.

386
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:36,041
Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

387
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:38,244
I was in Brooklyn.

388
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,413
Then I was here.
I don't know!

389
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:42,882
- Professor--
- Dean.

390
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,818
Henry, look I--

391
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,522
Okay.

392
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,090
Okay look.

393
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,359
Look, you know me, right?

394
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,561
I was your student
for three years,

395
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,797
- you know that I couldn't.
- I know you did!

396
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,135
No, you can't go in there.

397
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:05,070
What did he say?

398
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,139
Nothing useful.

399
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,760
You're just gonna leave him
in there?

400
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:09,875
I'm not letting him go.

401
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,477
No, I mean, that's inhumane.

402
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,618
There is procedures
for dealing with magical crimes.

403
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,914
A circuit court system.

404
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,549
They're sending
in a representative.

405
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,250
- What will they do with him?
- They have facilities.

406
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:20,920
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

407
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,055
- On what?
- On whether Penny lives.

408
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:25,057
This reeks of mind control.

409
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:26,958
Wait. There was something
wrong with his eyes.

410
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,953
They weren't entirely human,
that--that could be--

411
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,163
I looked in every scenario
there is to think of.

412
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,432
Spell gone wrong, doppelganger,

413
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:35,601
and yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

414
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:38,671
But there was always the chance
that he did this,

415
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,839
intentionally.

416
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:45,844
Good morning.

417
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,179
Pain killers.

418
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,714
Would be nice.

419
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,482
Your surgery
was very successful.

420
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,384
Your wounds are closed.

421
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:54,486
Just one or two weeks of--

422
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:57,323
Hey! You're not ready
to walk around yet.

423
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,058
I was stabbed, woman,

424
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,393
I'm gonna find
the motherfucker who--

425
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:03,329
Get Professor Lipson down here!

426
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,171
What?

427
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,990
It's spreading too quickly
to be an infection.

428
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,277
The wound is cursed.

429
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:18,878
Whatever it is,
is growing under the skin.

430
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,620
He's lucky it's not near
any vital organs.

431
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,949
- The necrotizing tissue--
- Necrotizing?

432
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,018
Cell death within the tissue.

433
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,479
If it touches
something important--

434
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,088
How do you fix it?

435
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,824
Without seeing the knife I...

436
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,492
I have no idea.

437
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:34,260
I hate magic.

438
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:35,595
I mean, why us?

439
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,497
You, I get.

440
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:39,332
I think about stabbing you
all the time.

441
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:44,137
That was a 100% not a joke.

442
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:46,439
You realized that knife
was coming at me

443
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,242
before you jump in the way
of it, right?

444
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:52,612
I owe you, like,
a Wookie Life Debt.

445
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,247
Get a knife.
I'll stab you right now.

446
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:03,890
I keep thinking--

447
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,960
- The Beast.
- It makes sense.

448
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:09,562
And yet it doesn't.

449
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,631
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

450
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:15,301
Yeah.

451
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:16,703
Hey, do you want me to--

452
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,405
Is there anyone you want me
to call?

453
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,573
Parents, siblings,

454
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,976
parole officer?

455
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,912
I'm good.

456
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,380
No, Quentin.

457
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,449
She cared, she'd be here.

458
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:36,790
No visitors.

459
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,957
Two minutes.

460
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,192
What could he possibly say

461
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:40,360
that would make you feel
any better?

462
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:42,529
I'm not here to feel better.

463
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,599
Please.

464
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:51,471
I was supposed to have
a date last night.

465
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:54,074
I got all dressed up.

466
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,544
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:02,415
All this stuff they're saying
I did, I don't remember.

468
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:05,018
You were blacked out.

469
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,060
Were you blacked out
when we met?

470
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,695
No, I don't want to buy a bible.

471
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:38,351
What safe house were you in?

472
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:40,720
I recognized your ink.

473
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,424
You see it more often than you'd
think in a place like this.

474
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:45,425
You're a Hedge?

475
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:46,893
No.

476
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:48,862
Classically trained, myself.

477
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:53,767
There's a special school,
called Brakebills.

478
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,603
You heard of it?

479
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:00,039
Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

480
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,876
in here to get away
from magic, so...

481
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,945
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

482
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:09,549
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

483
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,352
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

484
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,653
It's a gift.

485
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:16,055
Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

486
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,724
I'm not the guy outside of YMCA

487
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:18,958
yelling at people to repent.

488
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,060
Then what are you, Richard?

489
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:26,666
Okay, what we call magic is,

490
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,735
a set of tools.

491
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:30,670
Leftover from Creation.

492
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:32,305
Think about it.

493
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,574
The power to bend reality

494
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,409
to make and unmake.

495
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,712
Won't God be pissed we touched
His tools without asking?

496
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:46,186
God--
gods, really,

497
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:48,788
they don't do things
by accident.

498
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:51,391
The tools were left for us
to find.

499
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:53,026
Right.

500
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,362
But...

501
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:58,565
what I'm saying,

502
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,300
you don't have to take
my word for it.

503
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,172
See it for yourself.

504
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,617
<i>Please!</i>

505
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,589
Penny?

506
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,958
It's just a headache.

507
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,093
I brought you your homework.

508
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,896
- Why?
- Fair point.

509
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,632
But if you were me, I'd be glad
to talk to somebody else

510
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,767
who wasn't a Healing Student.

511
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,836
And since Kady's not here...

512
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:40,473
Oh, this is pity.

513
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:43,109
No.

514
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,477
Well, kind of.

515
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:46,018
I mean, she had shit to do
elsewhere.

516
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
It's--
I'm good.

517
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,414
- Great.
- I am.

518
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,085
I said great.
I get it.

519
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:55,188
People are generally
disappointing.

520
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:59,092
Yeah, be ready to pull a
ripcord at a moment's notice.

521
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,961
Like if you're messing around
with some loser who...

522
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,032
too obsessed with kid's books
to acknowledge he even sees you.

523
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,468
Ripcord.

524
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,340
Are you okay?

525
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,910
Can I do anything to help?

526
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,481
You want to help me,

527
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:23,516
go to my room

528
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:27,453
and find the bag of pills
that's stashed under my desk.

529
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,489
- Pills for what?
- For--I'm a Traveler freak

530
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,424
who hears voices
and I do a little

531
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:32,859
or a lot of self-medicating

532
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,029
to get them to shut
their scream-holes.

533
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,530
Penny.

534
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,499
Alice, I don't need
any judgment.

535
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,401
No, Penny.

536
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,336
Oh, okay.

537
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:47,941
Hey, look.

538
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:53,112
That's--that's not great.

539
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,914
Can someone get Quentin?

540
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,382
Now!

541
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,751
This is not what I pictured.

542
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,154
It's from the fourth
Fillory book.

543
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:03,423
I read them all for research.

544
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:07,293
Yeah, Jane, she was alone
in Fillory for the first time

545
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:09,429
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

546
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,090
- What's Lorian?
- They're the bad guys.

547
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,405
Uh, from a neighboring kingdom.

548
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,766
It's actually
really interesting,

549
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,302
because Fillory is both,
the name of the landmass

550
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,637
and also the one
of the sovereign states--

551
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,506
Quentin, focus, please.

552
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:21,641
Ah, yeah.

553
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:26,079
Ah, um, so the Lorian
stabbed Jane

554
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,660
with something
called the Virgo Blade.

555
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:30,683
And, uh, Rose vines grew
from the wounds--

556
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:32,986
This seems to be
the way grosser,

557
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,989
less whimsical version of that.

558
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,358
Um, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

559
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,726
Honeyclaw?

560
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,161
- Yeah. A-a talking bear.
- Oh, Jesus.

561
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:44,702
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

562
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:50,036
until they strangled her heart,
um, but Jane survived.

563
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,604
Penny, I know how to fix this.

564
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:56,863
Is that a turban?

565
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:58,757
No, it's your hair.

566
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,584
Sewing is not really my thing.

567
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,471
How is a voodoo doll
is supposed to help me?

568
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,339
Um, so, in the books,

569
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,942
Jane carried this doll with her
everywhere she goes,

570
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,944
and it looks just like her.

571
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:14,380
And so they realized
that the curse

572
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,684
of the Virgo Blade would accept
the doll as a substitute.

573
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,955
So, we burn a doll?

574
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,581
Okay, what else did your dumb
book says?

575
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,550
Henry.

576
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,452
It is considered good form

577
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:54,587
to announce oneself
to blind people.

578
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:57,557
My glasses only show me
your outline...vaguely.

579
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,560
In my defense, I was raised
by wolves for a time.

580
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:03,730
The knife
that Penny was stabbed with...

581
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:05,431
is from Fillory.

582
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:09,736
Something called the--
the Virgo Blade.

583
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,905
- And you're familiar?
- Yes.

584
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:14,407
This is a first.

585
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:17,143
You should've called for me
much sooner.

586
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:20,446
Quentin's the most at risk,
but if Penny dies...

587
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:23,316
This is your mess, Eliza.

588
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,819
Clean it up.

589
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:32,659
Then, get as far away
from my university as possible.

590
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,061
Do you understand?

591
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:43,303
Mr. Coldwater, I don't have
a lot of time at the moment.

592
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:44,837
It is the Beast, isn't it?

593
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:46,806
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

594
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,474
Of course Fillory is real.

595
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,076
You've known that
since you were a child.

596
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,045
It's why you're here.

597
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:54,314
Okay, but there's no Beast
in the books.

598
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,150
The books are a child's
drawing of Fillory.

599
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,519
The real thing is stranger.

600
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,721
Yeah, it's full
of psychopathic monsters

601
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:02,989
who are trying to kill me.

602
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,650
You want to know
what the Beast wants?

603
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,025
I'll tell you exactly.

604
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,994
He wants control of Fillory

605
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,529
and all the doors
that lead there.

606
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,299
Maybe, he thinks
you'll find one of them.

607
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,069
- I'm not a Traveler.
- There are other ways.

608
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,570
I gave you a book about it.

609
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,706
"Fillory and Further, Book Six"?

610
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:20,873
I told you.
I lost it.

611
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,610
And nothing lost was ever found?

612
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,278
Wait, there's, uh--
What about Penny?

613
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,646
There's got to be
something we can do.

614
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,382
You need to read between
the lines, Quentin.

615
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:33,286
Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

616
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:36,322
Was special because
of where it came from.

617
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,325
<i>Jane's mother gave it to her...</i>

618
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,427
<i>before she died.</i>

619
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:47,033
<i>It was all she took with her
to Fillory.</i>

620
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:50,870
<i>Her only reminder of her family
and her life on Earth.</i>

621
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:54,707
<i>It was her most precious
possession.</i>

622
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,344
<i>What we love can be as
important to us as our lives.</i>

623
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,981
So, the curse accepted the doll

624
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,951
as a proper sacrifice
in place of Jane's heart.

625
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:10,289
I know you have more questions

626
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,992
after you save your friend.

627
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,731
I found a way to break
the curse,

628
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,933
I just need a--
Penny!

629
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:24,170
Hey, asshole, I need to know
your most precious possession.

630
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,339
He's been out of it for like,
20 minutes.

631
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,343
Then, it's too late.

632
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:51,097
I beseech and devote myself.

633
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,968
I plead and promise myself...

634
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,837
to you,

635
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:00,173
She of the Grain,

636
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:04,077
that you would raise me
up above the chaff.

637
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,947
Amen?

638
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,415
<i>♪ You can still be ♪</i>

639
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,451
<i>♪ What you want to</i> ♪

640
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,853

<i>♪ You ♪</i>

646
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:37,543
<i>♪ You ♪</i>

647
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,744
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

648
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:42,284
I don't know. Penny doesn't
have that much stuff,

649
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:45,688
we'll just go through it.

650
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,505
Pictures.
Yeah, maybe it's something

651
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:50,939
from his childhood, his family.

652
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,541
He doesn't ever talk about them.

653
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:53,876
Doesn't mean he doesn't care
about them.

654
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:55,711
Penny's not
the most sentimental type.

655
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,846
Well, maybe he carefully
crafts that image,

656
00:34:57,947 --> 00:34:59,715
I don't know.
Everyone is sentimental.

657
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,484
- You're projecting.
- You're projecting!

658
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,522
Okay.

659
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:09,124
I'm getting a definite
circus clown vibe here.

660
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,993
Q, this is it.

661
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,629
You think, Penny's most prized
possession is his Adderall?

662
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,397
I have voices telling me,
all day long,

663
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,999
to do dark magic
and I don't know,

664
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,834
the pills were the one thing
that make them stop,

665
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:20,536
- they'd be pretty precious.
- You can always get more pills.

666
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:22,004
They're fungible.

667
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,405
You're fungible.

668
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:25,941
Okay, what's yours, hmm?

669
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,962
That's kind of a personal
question for two people

670
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,912
who aren't supposed to be
in the same room?

671
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,848
What's yours?

672
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,119
A quilt that my grandmother
made me when I was little.

673
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,024
It's covered in cats.

674
00:35:43,593 --> 00:35:46,595
"Fillory and Further",
book one, first edition.

675
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:49,264
I worked all summer
before eight grade to get it.

676
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,900
It's predictable I know.

677
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,702
Predictable's not bad, Quentin.

678
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,678
Hey.

679
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:05,180
What about this?

680
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:07,082
A candy bar wrapper?

681
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:08,343
It's from Brakebills South.

682
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,319
This is the last place
that he saw Kady.

683
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,522
Quentin, I don't think Penny
even cares that she's gone.

684
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:16,124
Believe me.

685
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:17,593
He does.

686
00:36:47,357 --> 00:36:49,691
What was that?
That you gave me?

687
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,260
Did it work?

688
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:53,328
It didn't feel like
I was doing a casting,

689
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:56,331
it felt like a casting
was being done on me.

690
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,834
It's because it's not a spell,
it was a prayer.

691
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:01,870
- To what?
- Local harvest deity.

692
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:03,639
Friendly,
but a little one-trick.

693
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,807
You're lucky she answered.
She's pretty shy.

694
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:08,710
It's like touching a bare wire.

695
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,079
More energy than I've felt.

696
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,247
It felt good.

697
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:14,917
It felt...dangerous.

698
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:20,923
The reason you treat magic
like a drug,

699
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,758
is because the people
that taught it to you

700
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,259
act like drug dealers.

701
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,994
They buy it and they sell it,

702
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:28,964
and they fight
and they fuck for it.

703
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:32,234
Well, that's not
the only way to live.

704
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,903
That's the only way
I've ever seen.

705
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:38,607
I'm a very good Magician

706
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,143
and I do this.

707
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,312
There are good people
out there, Julia.

708
00:37:43,413 --> 00:37:44,947
People trying to learn
about the world

709
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:46,715
and make it a better place.

710
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:48,684
Now, you can be
one of those people,

711
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,186
you can be a dealer,

712
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:54,456
you can stay here
and be nothing.

713
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,794
You get to choose.

714
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,439
If I give you something,

715
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,008
you think you can get it
into Brakebills for me?

716
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:18,213
Don't bother
with the performance.

717
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:21,216
Even with these wards,
I can see right through you.

718
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:23,585
I wouldn't dream of fooling you.

719
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:26,054
I have far bigger dreams
than that.

720
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:28,457
Very clever,
targeting someone else

721
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,058
outside the campus protections.

722
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,561
Graduate with an alumni key.

723
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:36,264
Attractive to a certain sort.

724
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:37,366
It won't work next time.

725
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:38,734
There won't be a next time.

726
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:40,469
You can't hide
in Fillory forever.

727
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,204
Lock as many doors as you want,

728
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:44,406
there's always a door to Fillory
when you need one.

729
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:46,108
Nothing's changed.

730
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:50,145
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

731
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,481
No, I never wanted this.

732
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:55,984
You forced my hand.
I wish I could be any other way.

733
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,821
I picked the Virgo Blade,
specially for you, Jane.

734
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,790
Little twinge of nostalgia.

735
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:05,260
Penny's going to live
and this meat puppet of yours

736
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,696
is going to a Salvadorian prison
in the morning.

737
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:09,598
All that scheming, wasted.

738
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:12,034
I could walk out of here
anytime I like.

739
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:15,437
If you can leave anytime,
what are you waiting for?

740
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:18,507
Oh, I was waiting...

741
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:19,975
for you.

742
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,680
Help me!

743
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,880
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait.

744
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,495
Dean Fogg.

745
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,000
What do we do?

746
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,104
What do we do?

747
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,073
I don't--I don't know.

748
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,708
Fuck that.

749
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,879
Eliza is dead. I--

750
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,581
When the Beast comes back,
what are we su--

751
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:11,151
She is the only one who could
actually give me answers.

752
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:14,888
There are no answers, Quentin.

753
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:19,626
Because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

754
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,096
Most likely outcome:

755
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:24,831
The Beast comes back.

756
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:29,536
Specially now that he's gotten
Eliza out of the way.

757
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,438
You die,

758
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,973
your friends die,

759
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,376
we all die

760
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,611
very bloody.

761
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,651
And all of this,

762
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,821
will have been for nothing.

763
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,233
Are you okay?

764
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:35,597
