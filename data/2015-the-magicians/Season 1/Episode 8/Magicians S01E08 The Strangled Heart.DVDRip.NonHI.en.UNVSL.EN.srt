00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,512
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,005
Let's just nip
this all in the bud.

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,200
You were a paramedic.
Call me Eliza.

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,607
I was there that day to
make sure that you got here.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,606
We flew here to Antarctica?

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,703
So what is this then?

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,772
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,409
Remove your clothes. Do it.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,648
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

10
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,458
They know everything at
Brakebills, what you've done.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,691
You cannot go back.

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,699
Hey, where's Kady?
Who gives a shit?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Run!

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,664
You can't keep going like this.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,936
I called a place. They
can take you tomorrow.

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,637
A "place"?

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,706
Mike. Eliot.

18
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,577
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,542
It's a little
something I invented.

20
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,652
Oh.

21
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,579
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

22
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,056
Beer?

23
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,127
You are lucky you're pretty.

24
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,656
Eliot.

25
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,388
You're back.

26
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,831
Hooray!

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,793
Oh, thank God.

28
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,337
How do you always have
drinks waiting for us? Uh...

29
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,341
Just a good host, I guess.

30
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,172
Guys, um, this
is my friend, Mike.

31
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,714
He graduated a few years
ago and lives in New York,

32
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,945
and Margo tried to kill him
with a Djinn, but we fixed it.

33
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,884
This is Alice, that's Quentin.

34
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,478
They are nerds. I
could kind of tell.

35
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,218
How was Brakebills South?
Did anyone freeze to death?

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,419
Uh... I mean, it was...

37
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,462
It was eventful. I...

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,823
Why is your face
making that face?

39
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,736
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,230
They totally had sex. Yup. Yeah.

41
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,083
No, nothing happened.
I mean, it just happened.

42
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:24,203
You got drunk on Mayakovsky's
lichen vodka and you seduced him.

43
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,905
Maybe I seduced her.

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,141
Please. And, sweetie,

45
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,550
getting drunk and porking a dungeon
master is nothing to be ashamed of.

46
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,814
Uh, "Porking"?

47
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,127
I was looking at the pork butt.

48
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,656
I'm going to go take a nap

49
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,523
and pretend that this entire
conversation never happened.

50
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,925
Okay.

51
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,092
Uh, um... I...

52
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,861
Nice meeting you. Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,101
Hey, eyes on the
pork butt, mister.

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,194
He's pretty. I know.

55
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,297
But I called dibs on him.

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,404
Hey, ignore Eliot. He's...

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,612
You know, just being Eliot.

58
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,246
Don't.

59
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,314
I thought "nap" was code.

60
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,591
Can we just talk about
this seriously for a second?

61
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:22,893
What we did was stress and
circumstances, and pheromones.

62
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,900
The first time, but
not the next four.

63
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,796
You were counting?

64
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,273
Of course I was counting.

65
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,566
Maybe Eliot was right.

66
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,908
We may as well have
been drunk or high, or...

67
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,503
I'm not under the
influence right now.

68
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,174
Yes, we are, Q.

69
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,016
I can still smell you,
but like, Fox-you,

70
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,783
and I'm pretty sure
you can still smell me.

71
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,382
That could have a lot to do

72
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,901
with the fact that we
haven't bathed in weeks.

73
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,655
Are you in love with me?

74
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:49,989
I, uh... I don't know.

75
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,691
Even if you fell
down on your knees

76
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,290
and proclaimed your, you know...

77
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,993
I know it wasn't really you.

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,471
I think that we need to
spend some time apart

79
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,738
so we can know what's
real and what's Fox.

80
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,685
<i>When they were lost,</i>

81
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,088
ancient sailors used
the stars to find their way,

82
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,853
but, for you,
they're an obstacle

83
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,019
because they
change circumstances

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,120
so they can really
bone your casting.

85
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,995
When you're factoring
the position of the Pleiades,

86
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,591
you want to keep in mind...

87
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,930
Whoa!

88
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,670
Whoa.

89
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,801
Sorry, I'll just, uh...

90
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,844
I'll leave you to your
little sewing circle.

91
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,040
There's a syllabus, Penny...

92
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,290
and you're supposed
to be studying...

93
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,805
Haven't you heard...
Haven't you...

94
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,560
You're supposed to be
studying astral projection.

95
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,779
Now, here's what I know.

96
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,220
I feel like less of a pussy if I don't
cower in fear of my own ability.

97
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,000
I mean, if I supposed
to ever be able to travel,

98
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,119
like, really travel
between worlds, I need...

99
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,738
I need to be able to master this

100
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,993
earthbound small
potato shit first.

101
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,692
Is something else going on?

102
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,262
I know that you
were close with Kady.

103
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,264
Not as close as you'd think.

104
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,337
You know, I... I
have a great idea.

105
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,584
I mean, you're so
worried about me,

106
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,949
why don't you
come travel with me?

107
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,084
You teach me,

108
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,383
and I know there's a few
things I could teach you, too.

109
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:35,026
I don't think that
would be appropriate.

110
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,303
Oh, I totally agree.

111
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,598
When do we leave?

112
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,009
You're going to be
late for your next class.

113
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,583
<i>Your first semester
at Brakebills</i>

114
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,748
was dedicated to learning
the fundamentals of magic.

115
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,625
We gave you the tools.

116
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,922
Now, it is time for
you to use them.

117
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,686
Look inside your bags.

118
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,968
Your course load will double.

119
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,100
Astronomy, botany,
just to name a few.

120
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,236
Study groups are mandatory.

121
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,773
<i>Gretchen.</i>

122
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,214
Hey, uh, so I heard that you, uh,
sleep with a Mister Spock body pillow.

123
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,882
No judgment. I just...

124
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,257
I myself, I have
a full collection

125
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,991
of Leonard Nimoy's
spoken word albums on vinyl.

126
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,098
You interested?

127
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,330
Quentin, what are you...

128
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,306
Gretchen, well,
basically begged me

129
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,138
to switch groups
with her and, um...

130
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,841
Sorry. I wore extra
deodorant, though.

131
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,643
Yeah. It's strong.

132
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,086
So, are we the
whole study group?

133
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,615
Hell is real,

134
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,859
and it smells like
Axe body spray.

135
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,156
<i>"Dear Quentin.</i>

136
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,269
<i>"Thought you should
know I gave up magic.</i>

137
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,067
<i>"You were right.</i>

138
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,472
<i>"Thanks for nothing</i>

139
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,237
<i>"and go fuck yourself."</i>

140
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,040
Who's your pen pal?

141
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,643
Leave before I start screaming.

142
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,514
Easy. I just came here to talk.

143
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,255
I'd say let's grab a
drink and hash it out,

144
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,733
but I feel like
that's a no-no here.

145
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,953
Why don't you talk about
what you did to Hannah?

146
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,154
I was protecting
myself from a thief

147
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,254
and I wish I hadn't
been put in that position.

148
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,626
Is this an amends letter?

149
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,503
Yes. Some of us are
capable of making them.

150
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,673
Okay.

151
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,776
Try this.

152
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,905
I'm sorry, Julia.

153
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,814
I don't let in a lot of
people. And the ones I do...

154
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:53,288
It's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit thing happening.

155
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,193
I actually like you.

156
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,429
And this?

157
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,265
This is not what I wanted.

158
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,704
You mean what you wrote?

159
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,307
You're giving it up?

160
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,012
Well, let's short-circuit
this whole thing.

161
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,805
You stay out of my ass

162
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,351
and there's no blood
feud necessary on my end.

163
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,349
But come after me,

164
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,390
and I will kill you and
everyone that you care about.

165
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,657
Well,

166
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,527
the ones that are left, anyway.

167
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,659
Such a bitch.

168
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,068
And you're weak.

169
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,407
Why apologize to him?

170
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,344
He's the one who
should be in here, not you.

171
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,073
Take your time, Professor.

172
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,487
You're good to go.

173
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,960
Okay, Henry.

174
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,722
Go ahead and try something.

175
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,299
Take it slow.

176
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,138
Okay.

177
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,237
It might take a
few tries, Henry.

178
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,044
There are physical
therapy exercises... Uh...

179
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,978
When I was four years old,

180
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,454
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

181
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,489
I taught myself magic.

182
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,652
I will do so again.

183
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,924
This is a disaster!

184
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,969
What's wrong? I
have nothing to wear.

185
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,337
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

186
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:53,005
I am not emotionally prepared
for Mike to see me in repeat outfits.

187
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,823
I think this might
be a Margo problem.

188
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,782
Obviously, Quentin,
but she's shacked up

189
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,817
with some artiste
at Encanto Octulo,

190
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,581
and, so, I'm stuck with you.

191
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,984
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

192
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,759
I made a horrible
mistake asking you to help.

193
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,921
Please, leave.

194
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,692
I was here first.

195
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,726
I've never really seen
you care about something.

196
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,934
Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

197
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,464
With some limited, but
very important exceptions.

198
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,844
Very limited.

199
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,776
But seriously, leave.

200
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,351
And those of you who don't
know me way too well already,

201
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,822
I'm Richard, I'm
the chaplain here.

202
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,951
And I will try to make
my thing today brief.

203
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,653
No matter why you started using,

204
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,792
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

205
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,996
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

206
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,939
but the one thing that
won't have changed is you.

207
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,473
Same head, same
heart, same mistakes.

208
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,878
Now, we don't like to hear it,

209
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,077
but we need something
or someone to lean on

210
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,382
that is bigger than ourselves.

211
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,819
Just say it.

212
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,355
God.

213
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,824
Well, that's one
way of putting it.

214
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:17,262
You know, there is a word for
when you lean on something,

215
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,026
a crutch.

216
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,991
Replacing drugs
or booze or porn,

217
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,400
or whatever with
a "Higher Power"

218
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,370
is just swapping one
crutch out for another.

219
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,207
That is a bummer
way of looking at things.

220
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,539
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

221
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,175
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what it actually is.

222
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,338
Uh...

223
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,442
What about making the
world what we want it to be?

224
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,919
You know, with a
little effort, a little faith.

225
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,753
Give a man hope and a
nickel, you got a nickel.

226
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,860
Who said that? Some dick.

227
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,122
Wow!

228
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,992
So, what do you believe in?

229
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,832
It doesn't have to
be God or whatever,

230
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,336
but something bigger than you.

231
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,070
I don't understand.

232
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,022
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

233
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,844
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

234
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,178
Yeah.

235
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,478
Maybe, we should move on.

236
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,595
If we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

237
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,215
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

238
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,383
It's a healing spell.

239
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,954
I've seen the welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

240
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,393
Actually, trick question.

241
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,988
It's a <i>Welwitschia mirabilis.</i>

242
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,097
The leaves are used for both, healing
spells and for doing exotic curses.

243
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,895
I thought it was a fern.

244
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,248
Which is why I
brought flash cards.

245
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,535
Of course you did.

246
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,475
Thank you, Alice.

247
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,769
Could you not... Could
you... For one minute,

248
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,281
could you not give
her googly eyes?

249
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,180
I don't know what you're,
uh, implying or inferring.

250
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,018
Brakebills South didn't
have a lot of things.

251
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,491
Livable weather,
edible food, cable TV.

252
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,585
But you know what it did have?

253
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,129
Windows.

254
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,723
So if you thought
no one saw your little,

255
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,463
little extracurricular
activities,

256
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,801
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

257
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,500
I was above average for a fox.

258
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,565
Okay, I've studied
enough for one day.

259
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,775
Thank you for that. It ain't
my fault or my problem.

260
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,826
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

261
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,284
I don't need your help.

262
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,950
But if I hypothetically did...

263
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,685
Man, you act like a stalker,

264
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,193
and then go out of your way
to deny that you're interested.

265
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,788
Either, grow a pair or she'll
find someone who already did.

266
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,694
Wow!

267
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,964
Not done.

268
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,203
Only downside is

269
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,774
it burns off all the alcohol.

270
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,236
Looks amazing.

271
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,115
Yeah, you don't have
to kill yourself for me.

272
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,709
It was no trouble.

273
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:57,949
I'm... I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

274
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:03,562
And, I mean, I feel like I should
be doing stuff like this for you,

275
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,894
but I don't really know how.

276
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,990
Oh, don't be silly.

277
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,834
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

278
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,032
where I start to bore you.

279
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,337
You don't bore me. I don't
think that you could bore me.

280
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,005
I don't know about
music and wine,

281
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,607
and, frankly, any
country not named Texas.

282
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,517
Texas is a state.

283
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,979
Not when you're
from Texas. Um...

284
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,185
Come here.

285
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,628
Where do you think I come from?

286
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,199
I don't know.
Someplace with money?

287
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,105
Well, we did have money

288
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,339
'til Grandmama
gambled it all away,

289
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,505
and now all we have are titles.

290
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,882
That was a joke.

291
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:06,119
I was born in Indiana.

292
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,025
On a farm.

293
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,396
My parents are farmers.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,198
Indiana? I... I thought you...

295
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,898
Of course you did.

296
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,570
Becoming me was the greatest
creative project of my life.

297
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,713
So...

298
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,680
FYI, no one else here
knows, except for Margo,

299
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,094
and that's only because
she was my secrets

300
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,586
partner in the Trials.

301
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,445
Everyone else,

302
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,185
I kind of let them
go on thinking

303
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:43,059
I grew up summering
with Kennedys, etcetera.

304
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,730
Thank you.

305
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,801
For what?

306
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:53,934
Just you.

307
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,542
Um, well...

308
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:03,841
Here I am.

309
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,778
Yeah.

310
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,345
Here you are.

311
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,847
Hi. Hey.

312
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,355
I checked the position
of Cepheus three times,

313
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,755
I did the whole invocation,

314
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,023
this stupid plant should
be seven feet tall by now.

315
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,193
What?

316
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,530
What happened to you and Kady?

317
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,329
You guys were inseparable.

318
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,635
She gets through the Trials,

319
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,734
she passes all of Mayakovsky's
tests and then she's just...

320
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,676
She didn't give me an itinerary.

321
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,614
Man, I don't get it.

322
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,810
You act like you're
this panty-whisperer,

323
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,511
and your girl disappears and
you don't even know where she is.

324
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,558
You see her, tell her
she owes me 20 bucks.

325
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,752
Can I help you?

326
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,828
What?

327
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,920
Not you.

328
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,898
Uh, hey, Mike.

329
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,233
Sorry. I got... I got a
little turned around, um...

330
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,101
Could you tell me
which way the cottage is?

331
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,773
Yeah. It's like...

332
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,144
Shit.

333
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,196
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Whoa!

334
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,401
Help! Help! Somebody help!

335
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,706
Get a transfusion ready, get
the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.

336
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,917
Can you mend the wound?

337
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,534
It's deep, but it's
not impossible.

338
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,753
The weapon. We need the weapon.

339
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,870
Quentin. Mike. Mike has it.

340
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,156
I need to see the knife to know.

341
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,524
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
- To know what?

342
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,107
Find him. Now.

343
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,116
Mike is, uh, Eliot's
boyfriend, I guess.

344
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,113
He was trying to kill me

345
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,555
before Penny jumped in the way.

346
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,735
Could it have anything
to do with The Beast?

347
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,783
Why would it?

348
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,024
Because it makes more sense
than somebody new trying to kill me.

349
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,328
Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

350
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,925
We will certainly ask
Mr. McCormick when we find him.

351
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,670
Quentin.

352
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,608
Is Penny okay?

353
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,911
He's in surgery. I don't know.

354
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,012
I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

355
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,061
Yeah, I would've told you, but Fogg
wouldn't let us leave the building until...

356
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,383
Until they find Mike.

357
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,682
They did find him.

358
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,233
Professor Sunderland and March
found him trying to open a portal

359
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,520
near the Welters stadium.

360
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,594
Oh...

361
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,224
Where are they taking him?

362
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,767
Have you ever been
in this room before?

363
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,999
It was designed at
the turn of the century

364
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:17,203
for a set of incredibly
delicate experiments.

365
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,768
Mechanisms within the walls
prevent any spell-casting.

366
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,508
It is, in fact, a clean room.

367
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,050
It was not intended
for this purpose,

368
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,519
but it will do.

369
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,656
Where is the weapon

370
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,349
that you used? I don't know.

371
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,793
Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

372
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,854
I was in Brooklyn.

373
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,163
Then I was here. I don't know!

374
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,634
Professor... Dean.

375
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,398
Henry, look, I...

376
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,300
Okay.

377
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,776
Okay, look.

378
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,005
Look, you know me, right?

379
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,310
I was your student
for three years.

380
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,941
You know that I couldn't.

381
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,508
I know you did!

382
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,053
No. You can't go in there.

383
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:05,916
What did he say?

384
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,323
Nothing useful.

385
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,400
You're just gonna
leave him in there?

386
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,555
I'm not letting him go.

387
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,257
No, I mean, that's inhuman.

388
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,371
There is procedures for
dealing with magical crimes.

389
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,767
A circuit court system. They're
sending in a representative.

390
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,998
What will they do with
him? They have facilities.

391
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,563
But the exact
punishment, it depends.

392
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,734
On what? On whether Penny lives.

393
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,744
This reeks of mind control.

394
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,746
Wait, there was something
wrong with his eyes.

395
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,611
They weren't entirely
human, that could be...

396
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,844
I've looked at every
scenario there is to think of.

397
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,079
Spell gone wrong, doppelganger,

398
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,213
and, yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

399
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,156
But there is always the
chance that he did this,

400
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,488
intentionally.

401
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,497
Good morning.

402
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,991
Painkillers would be nice.

403
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,162
Your surgery was
very successful.

404
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,001
Your wounds are closed.

405
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,631
Just one or two weeks of...

406
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,972
Hey. You're not ready
to walk around yet.

407
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,705
I was stabbed, woman,

408
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,258
I'm gonna find the
motherfucker who...

409
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,212
Get Professor Lipson down here!

410
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,986
What?

411
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,119
It's spreading too
quickly to be an infection.

412
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,961
The wound is cursed. Whatever
it is, it's growing under the skin.

413
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,898
He's lucky it's not
near any vital organs.

414
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,162
The necrotizing tissue...

415
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,259
Necrotizing?

416
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,668
Oh, cell death
within the tissue.

417
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,785
If it touches something
important... How do you fix it?

418
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,604
Without seeing the knife, I...

419
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,344
I have no idea.

420
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,547
I hate magic.

421
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,912
I mean, why us?

422
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,416
You, I get.

423
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,510
I think about stabbing
you all the time.

424
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,381
That was 100% not a joke.

425
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,759
You realize that knife
was coming at me

426
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,057
before you jumped
in the way of it, right?

427
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,895
I owe you, like, a
Wookiee life debt.

428
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,491
Get a knife. I'll
stab you right now.

429
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,202
I keep thinking...

430
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,269
The Beast. It makes sense.

431
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,839
And yet it doesn't.

432
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,845
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

433
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,547
Yeah.

434
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,821
Hey, do you want me to...

435
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,052
Uh... Is there anyone
you want me to call?

436
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,616
Parents, siblings,

437
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,230
parole officer?

438
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,154
I'm good.

439
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,700
No, Quentin.

440
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,759
She cared, she'd be here.

441
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,038
No visitors.

442
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,169
Two minutes.

443
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,589
What could he possibly say that
would make you feel any better?

444
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,343
I'm not here to feel better.

445
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,014
Please?

446
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,123
I was supposed to
have a date last night.

447
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,193
I got all dressed up.

448
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,052
I'm sorry.

449
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:03,632
All this stuff they're saying
I did, I don't remember.

450
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,232
You were blacked out.

451
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,310
Were you blacked
out when we met?

452
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:30,893
No, I don't want to buy a bible.

453
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,463
What safe house were you in?

454
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:40,964
I recognized your ink.

455
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,334
You see it more often than
you'd think in a place like this.

456
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,611
You're a Hedge?

457
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,139
No. Classically trained, myself.

458
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,379
There's a special
school called Brakebills.

459
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,514
You heard of it?

460
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,190
Yeah. Well... I sort
of checked myself

461
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,991
in here to get away
from magic, so...

462
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,125
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

463
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,727
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean. It's not.

464
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,533
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

465
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,798
It's a gift.

466
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,172
Oh, God, please
don't say "From God."

467
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,110
I'm not the guy outside of the
YMCA yelling at people to repent.

468
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,241
Then what are you, Richard?

469
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,316
Okay, what we call "magic" is

470
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,085
a set of tools,

471
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,783
leftover from Creation.

472
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,123
Think about it.

473
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,525
The power to bend reality,
to make and unmake.

474
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,896
Won't God be pissed we
touched His tools without asking?

475
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,369
God... Gods, really,

476
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,904
they don't do
things by accident.

477
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,535
The tools were
left for us to find.

478
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,909
Right.

479
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,140
But, what I'm saying,

480
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,483
you don't have to
take my word for it.

481
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,423
See it for yourself.

482
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,393
<i>Please!</i>

483
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,499
<i>You can't keep doing this to me!</i>

484
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,130
Penny?

485
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,242
It's just a headache.

486
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,205
I brought you your homework.

487
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,740
Why? Fair point.

488
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,610
But if it were me, I'd be
glad to talk to somebody else

489
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,280
who wasn't a Healing student.

490
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,023
And since Kady's not here...

491
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,424
Oh, this is pity.

492
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,586
No.

493
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,521
Well, kind of.

494
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,123
I mean, she had shit to do
elsewhere. It's... I'm good.

495
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,498
Great. I am.

496
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:50,900
I said great.

497
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,094
I get it.

498
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,973
People are generally
disappointing.

499
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,706
Yeah, be ready to pull a
ripcord at a moment's notice.

500
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,942
Like if you're messing
around with some loser who's

501
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:07,077
too obsessed with kids' books to
acknowledge he even sees you.

502
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,381
Ripcord.

503
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,287
Are you okay?

504
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,152
Can I do anything to help?

505
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,058
You want to help me?

506
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,730
Go to my room

507
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,705
and find the bag of pills
that's stashed under my desk.

508
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,442
Pills for what? For...
I'm a Traveler freak

509
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,910
who hears voices and I do a
little or a lot of self-medicating

510
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,948
to get them to shut
their scream-holes.

511
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,509
Penny. Uh...

512
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,382
Alice, I don't need
any judgment.

513
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,452
No, Penny.

514
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,020
Oh. Okay.

515
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,997
That's... That's not great.

516
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,659
Can someone get Quentin?

517
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,861
Now!

518
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,567
This is not what I pictured.

519
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:02,130
It's from the
fourth Fillory book.

520
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,835
I read them all for research.

521
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,269
Yeah, Jane, um, she was
alone in Fillory for the first time

522
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,213
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

523
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,217
What's Lorian? Uh,
they're the bad guys.

524
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,461
Uh, from a neighboring kingdom.

525
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,696
It's actually really interesting

526
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,985
because Fillory is both,
the name of the land mass

527
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,433
and also the one of
the sovereign states...

528
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,892
Quentin, focus, please.

529
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,153
Uh, yeah.

530
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,625
Um, so the Lorian, uh, stabbed Jane
with something called a Virgo Blade.

531
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,761
And, uh, rose vines
grew from the wounds.

532
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,829
So, this seems to
be the way-grosser,

533
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,874
less whimsical version of that.

534
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,316
Uh, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

535
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,710
Honeyclaw?

536
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,940
Yeah. A talking bear.

537
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,107
Oh, Jesus.

538
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,393
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

539
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,717
until they strangled her
heart, um, but Jane survived.

540
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,986
Penny, I know how to fix this.

541
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,854
Is that a turban?

542
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,961
No, it's your hair.

543
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,034
Sewing is not really my thing.

544
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,531
How is a voodoo doll
supposed to help me?

545
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,664
Uh, so, in the books,

546
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,019
Jane carries this doll around
with her everywhere she goes,

547
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,944
and it looks just like her.

548
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:17,142
Uh, and so they realized that
the curse of the Virgo Blade

549
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,241
would accept the
doll as a substitute.

550
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,786
So we burn a doll?

551
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,616
Okay, what else does
your dumb book say?

552
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,547
Henry.

553
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:56,647
It is considered good form to
announce oneself to blind people.

554
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,783
My glasses only show
me your outline, vaguely.

555
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,589
In my defense, I was
raised by wolves for a time.

556
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,631
The knife that Penny
was stabbed with

557
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,361
is from Fillory.

558
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,629
Something called
the Virgo Blade.

559
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,862
And you are familiar?

560
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:13,938
Yes.

561
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,337
This is a first.

562
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,374
You should've called
for me much sooner.

563
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,437
Quentin's the most at
risk, but if Penny dies...

564
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,348
This is your mess, Eliza.

565
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,083
Clean it up.

566
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:33,656
Then get as far away from
my university as possible.

567
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,518
Do you understand?

568
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,229
Mr. Coldwater, I don't have
a lot of time at the moment.

569
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,931
It is The Beast, isn't it?

570
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,974
And he's from
Fillory, which is real.

571
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,474
Of course Fillory is real.

572
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,603
You've known that since you
were a child. It's why you're here.

573
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,239
Okay, but there's no
Beast in the books.

574
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,874
The books are a
child's drawing of Fillory.

575
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,078
The real thing is stranger.

576
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,857
Yeah, it's full of psychopathic
monsters who are trying to kill me.

577
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,514
You want to know
what The Beast wants?

578
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,021
I'll tell you exactly.

579
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,460
He wants control of Fillory
and all the doors that lead there.

580
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,289
Maybe, he thinks
you'll find one of them.

581
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,697
I'm not a Traveler.

582
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,963
There are other ways.

583
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,561
I gave you a book about it.

584
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,470
<i>Fillory and Further, Book Six?</i>

585
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,735
I told you, I lost it.

586
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,777
And nothing lost was ever found?

587
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,843
Wait, there's, uh...

588
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,423
What about Penny? There's
got to be something we can do.

589
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,076
You need to read
between the lines, Quentin.

590
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,518
Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

591
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,049
<i>It was special because
of where it came from.</i>

592
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,022
<i>Jane's mother gave it to her</i>

593
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,695
<i>before she died.</i>

594
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,559
<i>It was all she took
with her to Fillory.</i>

595
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:52,100
<i>Her only reminder of her
family and her life on Earth.</i>

596
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,871
<i>It was her most
precious possession.</i>

597
00:32:56,675 --> 00:33:00,203
<i>What we love can be as
important to us as our lives.</i>

598
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:04,205
So, the curse accepted the doll

599
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,451
as a proper sacrifice
in place of Jane's heart.

600
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,787
I know you have more questions.

601
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,122
After you save your friend.

602
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:22,561
I found a way to break the
curse. I just need a... Penny!

603
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,034
Hey, asshole, I need to know
your most precious possession.

604
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,232
He's been out of it
for, like, 20 minutes.

605
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,938
Then it's too late.

606
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,620
I beseech and devote myself.

607
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,102
I plead and promise myself

608
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,563
to you,

609
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,107
She of the Grain,

610
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,905
that you will raise
me up above the chaff.

611
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,778
Amen?

612
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:27,565
<i>When I met you</i>

613
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,624
How are we supposed
to know what's important?

614
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,192
I don't know. Penny
doesn't have that much stuff,

615
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,741
we'll just to through it.

616
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:53,620
Pictures. Yeah, maybe it's something
from his childhood, his family.

617
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,902
He doesn't ever talk about them.

618
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,470
Doesn't mean he
doesn't care about them.

619
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,190
Penny's not the
most sentimental type.

620
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,658
Well, maybe he
carefully crafts that image,

621
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,462
I don't know. Everyone
is sentimental.

622
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,467
You're projecting.
You're projecting!

623
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,436
Okay.

624
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,742
I'm getting a definite
circus clown vibe here.

625
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,437
Q, this is it.

626
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,604
You think Penny's most prized
possession is his Adderall?

627
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,527
If I had voices telling me all day
long to do dark magic and, I don't know,

628
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,195
the pills were the one
thing that made them stop,

629
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,164
they'd be pretty precious.
You can always get more pills.

630
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,315
They're fungible.

631
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,549
You're fungible.

632
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,455
Okay, what's yours, hmm?

633
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,438
That's kind of a personal
question for two people

634
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,142
who aren't supposed
to be in the same room?

635
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,626
What's yours?

636
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,632
A quilt that my grandmother
made me when I was little.

637
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,638
It's covered in cats.

638
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,210
<i>Fillory and Further,
Book One,</i> first edition.

639
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,340
I worked all summer
before eighth grade to get it.

640
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,976
It's predictable, I know.

641
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,284
Predictable's not bad, Quentin.

642
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,755
Hey.

643
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,862
What about this?

644
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,294
A candy bar wrapper?

645
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,448
It's from Brakebills South. This
is the last place that he saw Kady.

646
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,901
Quentin, I don't think Penny
even cares that she's gone.

647
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,233
Believe me, he does.

648
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,339
What was that? That you gave me?

649
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,804
Did it work?

650
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,040
It didn't feel like I
was doing a casting,

651
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,050
it felt like a casting
was being done on me.

652
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,450
It's because it's not a
spell, it was a prayer.

653
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,685
To what? Local harvest deity.

654
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,349
Friendly, and
a little one-trick.

655
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,469
You're lucky she
answered. She's pretty shy.

656
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,292
It's like touching a bare wire.

657
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,688
More energy than I've ever felt.

658
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:14,765
It felt good.

659
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,294
It felt dangerous.

660
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,538
The reason you treat
magic like a drug,

661
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,440
is because the people
that taught it to you

662
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,808
act like drug dealers.

663
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,536
They buy it and they sell it,

664
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,844
and they fight
and they fuck for it.

665
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,715
But that's not the
only way to live.

666
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,450
That's the only
way I've ever seen.

667
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,192
I'm a very good Magician

668
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,318
and I do this.

669
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,925
There are good
people out there, Julia.

670
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,525
People trying to learn about the
world and make it a better place.

671
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,331
Now, you could be
one of those people,

672
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,065
you could be a dealer,

673
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,141
you could stay here, be nothing.

674
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,907
You get to choose.

675
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,989
If I give you something,

676
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,556
you think you can get
it into Brakebills for me?

677
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,795
Don't bother with
the performance.

678
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,758
Even with these wards, I
can see right through you.

679
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,401
I wouldn't dream of fooling you.

680
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,633
I have far bigger
dreams than that.

681
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,907
Very clever, targeting someone

682
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,534
outside the campus protections.

683
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,174
Graduate with an alumni key.

684
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,776
Attractive, to a certain sort.

685
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,941
It won't work next time.

686
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,416
There won't be a next time.

687
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:42,953
You can't hide
in Fillory forever.

688
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:44,921
Lock as many doors as you want,

689
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,934
there's always a door to
Fillory when you need one.

690
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,551
Nothing's changed.

691
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,595
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

692
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,966
You know I never wanted this.

693
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,467
You forced my hand.

694
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,560
I wish it could
be any other way.

695
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,536
I picked the Virgo Blade
especially for you, Jane.

696
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,166
Little twinge of nostalgia.

697
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,806
Penny's going to live and
this meat puppet of yours

698
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,314
is going to a Salvadorian
prison in the morning.

699
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,111
All that scheming, wasted.

700
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,618
I could walk out of
here anytime I like.

701
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,687
If you can leave anytime,
then what are you waiting for?

702
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,691
Oh, I was waiting

703
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:21,916
for you.

704
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,196
Help me!

705
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,294
Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

706
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:50,714
Dean Fogg.

707
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,318
What do we do?

708
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,419
What do we do?

709
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,317
I don't know.

710
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,052
Fuck that.

711
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,099
Eliza is dead. I...

712
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,426
When The Beast comes
back, what are we...

713
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,472
She is the only one who
could actually give me answers.

714
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,432
There are no answers, Quentin.

715
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:22,370
Because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

716
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,780
Most likely outcome,

717
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:30,854
especially now that he's
gotten Eliza out of the way,

718
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,758
you die,

719
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,290
your friends die,

720
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,730
we all die,

721
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,899
very bloody.

722
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,531
And all of this,

723
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,136
will have been for nothing.

724
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,281
Are you okay?
