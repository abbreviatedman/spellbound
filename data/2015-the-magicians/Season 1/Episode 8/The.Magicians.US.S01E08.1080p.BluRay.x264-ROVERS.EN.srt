NARRATOR: Previously on
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,989
THE BEAST: Let's just nip
this all in the bud.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,196
You were a paramedic.
Call me Eliza.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,635
I was there that day
to make sure
that you got here.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,636
We flew here to Antarctica?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,710
So what is this then?

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,791
We're here to
study with Mayakovsky.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,440
Remove your clothes. Do it.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,679
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,469
They know
everything at Brakebills,
what you've done.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,675
You cannot go back.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,757
Hey, where's Kady?
Who gives a shit?

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,230
Run!

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,713
You can't keep
going like this.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,950
I called a place.
They can take you tomorrow.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,669
<i>A u?</i>

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,718
Mike.
Eliot.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,632
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,593
It's a little
something I invented.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,670
Oh.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,589
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,079
Beer?

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,149
You are lucky
you're pretty.
(LAUGHS)

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,669
QUENTIN: Eliot.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,433
You're back.
(CLEARS THROAT)

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,840
Hooray!

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,799
Oh, thank God.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,349
How do you always
have drinks waiting for us?
Uh...

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,353
Just a good host,
I guess.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
Guys, um, this is
my friend, Mike.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,749
He graduated a few years ago
and lives in New York,

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,958
and Margo tried to
kill him with a Djinn,
but we fixed it.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,917
This is Alice,
that's Quentin.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,479
They are nerds.
I could kind of tell.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
How was Brakebills South?
Did anyone freeze to death?

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,470
Uh... I mean, it was...
(CLEARS THROAT)

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,517
It was eventful. I...

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,872
Why is your face
making that face?

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,757
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,239
Yeah.
They totally had sex.
Yup.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,033
No, nothing happened.
I mean,
itjust happened.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,233
You got drunk on
Mayakovsky's lichen vodka
and you seduced him.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,913
Maybe I seduced her.

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,156
Please. And, sweetie,

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,552
getting drunk and
porking a dungeon master
is nothing to be ashamed of.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,835
Uh, "Porking"?

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,149
I was looking
at the pork butt.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,674
ALICE: I'm going to go
take a nap

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,516
and pretend that
this entire conversation
neverhappened.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,954
Okay-

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,112
Uh, um... I...

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,913
Nice meeting you.
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,117
Hey, eyes on
the pork butt, mister.

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,190
He's pretty.
I know.

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,351
Butlcaﬂed
dibs on him.
(CHUCKLES)

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,431
Hey, ignore Eliot. He's...

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,637
You know,
just being Eliot.

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,273
Don't.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,352
I thought"nap"
was code.

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,592
Can we just talk
about this seriously
for a second?

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,955
What we did was
stress and circumstances,
and pheromones.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,952
The first time,
but not the next four.

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,833
You were counting?

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,274
Of course
I was counting.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,590
Maybe Eliot was right.

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,910
We may as well have been
drunk or high, or...

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,559
I'm not under
the influence right now.

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,191
Yes, we are, Q.

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,031
I can still smell you,
but like, Fox-you,

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,793
and I'm pretty sure
you can still smell me.

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,390
That could have
a lot to do

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,834
with the fact that
we haven't bathed
in weeks.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,678
Are you in love with me?

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,029
I, uh... I don't know.

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,713
Even if you fell
down on your knees

76
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,313
and proclaimed your,
you know...

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,039
I know it wasn't
really you.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,474
I think that we need to
spend some time apart

79
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,790
so we can know what's
real and what's Fox.

80

81
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,076
ancient sailors
used the stars
to find their way,

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,878
but, for you,
they're an obstacle

83

becausethey
change circumstances

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,111
so they can really
bone your casting.

When you're factoring
the position
of the Pleiades,

86
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,593
you want to
keep in mind...

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,954
(WATER SPLASHING)
Whoa!

88
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,670
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,793
Sorry, I'll just, uh...

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,872
I'll leave you to your
little sewing circle.

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,073
There's a syllabus,
Penny“.
(SIGHS)

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,275
...and you're supposed
to be studying...

93
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,839
Haven't you heard...
Haven't you...

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,513
You're supposed
to be studying
astral projection.

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,795
Now, here's what I know.

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,236
I feel like less of a pussy
if I don't cower in
fear of my own ability.

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,958
I mean, if I supposed to
ever be able to travel,

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,158
like, really travel
between worlds, I need...

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,710
I need to be
able to master this

100

potato shit first.

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,718
ls something else
going on?

102
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,310
I know that you
were close with Kady.

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,313
Not as close
as you'd think.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,397
You know, I...
I have a great idea.

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,597
I mean,
you're so worried
about me,

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,998
why don't you
come travel with me?

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,118
You teach me,

108
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,390
and I know
there's a few things
I could teach you, too.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,073
I don't think that
would be appropriate.

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,311
Oh, I totally agree.

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,635
When do we leave?

112
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,033

DEAN FOGG: <i>Your first
semester at Brakebills</i>

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,752
was dedicated to learning
the fundamentals of magic.

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,634
We gave you the tools.

117
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,954
Now, it is time
for you to use them.

118
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,719

that you, uh, sleep with
a Mister Spock body pillow.

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,879
No judgment. I just...

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,236
I myself,
I have a full collection

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,995
of Leonard Nimoy's
spoken word albums
on vinyl.

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,114

Quentin, what are you...

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,279
Gretchen,
well, basically begged me

130
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,158
to switch groups
with her and, um...

131
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,833
Sorry. I wore
extra deodorant, though.

132
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,679
Yeah. It's strong.

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,077

I just came here to talk.

I'd say let's grab
a drink and hash it out,

like that's a no-no here.

what you did to Hannah?

myself from a thief

been put in that position.

Yes. Some of us are
capable of making them.

Okay-

155
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,794
Try this.

156
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,911
I'm sorry, Julia.

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,830
I don't let in
a lot of people.
And the ones I do...

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,315
It's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit
thing happening.

I actually like you.

160
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,438
And this?

161
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,273
This is not what I wanted.

162
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,679
You mean
what you wrote?

You're giving it up?

this whole thing.

out of my ass

should be in here, not you.

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,076
FOGG: Take your time,
Professor.

177
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,478
You're good to go.

178
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,959
Okay, Henry.

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,755
Go ahead
and try something.

180
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,110
(INHALES DEEPLY)

181
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,271
(EXHALES)
Take it slow.

182
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,113
Okay.
(GROANS)

183
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,237
It might take
a few tries, Henry.

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,039
There are physical
therapy exercises...
Uh...

185
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,950
When I was
four years old,

186
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,436
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

187
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,472
I taught myself magic.

188
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,633
I will do so again.

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,958
ELIOT: This is a disaster!

190
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,953
QUENTIN:
What's wrong?
I have nothing to wear.

191
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,317
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,998
I am not
emotionally prepared for Mike
to see me in repeat outfits.

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,754
I think this might
be a Margo problem.

194
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,797
Obviously, Quentin,
but she's shacked up

195
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,797
with some artiste
at Encanto Octulo,

196
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,598
and, so, I'm stuck
with you.

197
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,950
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

198
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,717
I made a horrible
mistake asking you to help.

199
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,870
Please, leave.

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,678
I was here first.

201
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,711
I've never really
seen you care
about something.

202
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,910
Things aren't
usually worth caring about.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,470
With some limited,
but very important
excepﬁons.

204
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,839
Very limited.

205
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,794
But seriously, leave.

206
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,317
And those of you
who don't know me
way too well already,

207
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,794
I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here.

208
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,952
And I will try to make
my thing today brief.

209
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,629
No matter why
you started using,

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,758
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

211
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,958
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

212
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,960
but the one thing
that won't have
changed is you.

213
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,433
Same head,
same heart, same mistakes.

214
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,874
Now, we don't like
to hear it,

215
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,078
but we need something
or someone to lean on

216
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,356
that is bigger
than ourselves.

217
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,839
Just say it.

218
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,316
God.

219
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,789
Well, that's one way
of putting it.

220
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,238
You know, there is a word
for when you
lean on something,

221
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,038
a crutch.
(CHUCKLES)

222
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,949
Replacing drugs
or booze or porn,

223
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,394
or whatever with
a "Higher Power"

224
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,391
is just swapping one
crutch out for another.

225
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,195
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

226
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,556
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

227
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,191
Maybe we just need to
accept the world for
what it actually is.

228
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,310
Uh...

229
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,438
What about making the world
what we want it to be?

230
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,909
You know, with a little
effort, a little faith.

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,753
Give a man hope
and a nickel,
you got a nickel.

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,831
Who said that?
Some dick.

234
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,115
Wow!

235
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,995
So, what do you
behevein?

236
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,829
It doesn't have to
be God or whatever,

237
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,309
but something bigger
than you.

238
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,035
QUENTIN:
I don't understand.

239
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,952
ALICE: The idea is
you look at the list
of ingredients

240
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,838
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

241
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,194
Yeah.

242
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,475
Maybe, we should move on.

243
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,517
If we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

244
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,195
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

245
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,395
It's a healing spell.

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,956
I've seen
the welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

247
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,360
Actually,
trick question.

248
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>It's</i> a
<i>Welwitschia mirabilis.</i>

249
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,115
The leaves are used
for both, healing spells
and for doing exotic curses.

250
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,873
I thought it was a fern.

251
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,155
Which is why I
brought flash cards.

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,554
Of course you did.

253
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,479
Thank you, Alice.

254
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,749
Could you not...
Could you... For one minute,

255
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,274
could you not
give her googly eyes?

256
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,150
I don't know what you're,
uh, implying or inferring.

257
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,999
Brakebills South
didn't have a lot of things.

258
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,471
Livable weather,
edible food, cable TV.

259
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,551
But you know
what it did have?

260
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,153
Windows.

261
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,709
So ifyou thought no
one saw your little,

263
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,796
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

264
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,473
I was above average for a fox.

265
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,551
Okay, I've studied
enough for one day.

266
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,799
Thank you for that.
It ain't my
fault or my problem.

267
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,758
For the record, you do see
that you're
doing wrong, though?

268
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,274
I don't need your help.

269
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,913
But if I hypothetically did...

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,674
Man, you act like a stalker,

271
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,159
and then go out of your way
to deny that
you're interested.

272
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,796
Either, grow a pair
or she'll find
someone who already did.

273
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,675
Wow!

it burns off all the alcohol.

Yeah, you don't have
to kill yourself for me.

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,713
It was no trouble.

282
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,953
I'm... I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

283
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,552
And, I mean,
I feel like I should be
doing stuff like this for you,

284
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,879
but I don't really know how.

285
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,950
Oh, don't be silly.

286
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,795
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

287
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,996
where I start to bore you.

288
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,310
You don't bore me.
I don't think that
you could bore me.

291
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,514
Texas is a state.

292
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,992
Not when you're from Texas.
Um...

I come from?

295
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,160
I don't know.
Someplace with money?

296
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,072
Well, we did have money

have are titles.

That was a joke.

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,116

Of course you did.

00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,195
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Whoa!

352
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,310
(GROANS)

353
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,393
Help! Help! Somebody help!

354
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,715
Get a transfusion ready,
get the Reidlinger
Stones warmed up.

355
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,870
FOGG: Can you mend
the wound?

356
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,553
It's deep, but
it's not impossible.

357
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,710
The weapon.
We need the weapon.

358
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,870
Quentin.
Mike. Mike has it.

359
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,075
I need to see
the knife to know.

360
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes, yes, yes, I know.
QUENTIN: To know what?

361
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,119
Find him. Now.

362
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,117
Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

363
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,075
He was trying to kill me

364
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,554
before Penny
jumped in the way.

365
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,678
Could it have anything
to do with The Beast?

366
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,750
Why would it?

367
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,037
Because it makes more sense
than somebody new
trying to kill me.

368
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,316
Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

369
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,960
We will certainly
ask Mr. McCormick
when we find him.

370
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,634
Quentin.

371
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,594
ls Penny okay?

372
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,914
He's in surgery. I don't know.

373
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,990
I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

374
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,993
Yeah, I would've told you,
but Fogg wouldn't let us
leave the building until...

375
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,354
Until they find Mike.

376
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,675
They did find him.

377
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,149
Professor Sunderland
and March found him
trying to open a portal

378
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,514
near the Welters stadium.

379
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,590
Oh...

380
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,229
Where are they taking him?

381
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,755
Have you ever been
in this room before?

382
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,000
It was designed at
the turn of the century

383
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,199
for a set of incredibly
delicate experiments.

384
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,749
Mechanisms within the walls
prevent any spell-casting.

385
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,520
It is, in fact, a clean room.

386
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,036
It was not intended
for this purpose,

387
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,519
but it will do.
(SCOFFS)

388
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,679
Where is the weapon

389
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,311
that you used?
I don't know.

390
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,791
Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

391
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,837
I was in Brooklyn.

392
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,117
Then I was here.
I don't know!

393
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,634
Dean.
Professor...

394
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,393
Henry, look, I...

395
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,313
Okay-

396
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,754
Okay, look.

397
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,996
Look, you know me, right?

398
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,310
I was your student
for three years.

399
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,959
You know that I couldn't.

400
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,519
I know you did!

401
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,077
No. You can't go in there.

402
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,915
What did he say?

403
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,320
Nothing useful.

404
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,314
You're just gonna
leave him in there?

405
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,515
I'm not letting him go.

406
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,233
No, I mean,
that's inhuman.

407
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,311
There is procedures
for dealing with
magical crimes.

408
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,755
A circuit court system.
They're sending in
a representative.

409
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,990
What will they do with him?
They have facilities.

410
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,515
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

411
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,671
On what?
On whether Penny lives.

412
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,671
This reeks of mind control.

413
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,671
Wait, there was something
wrong with his eyes.

414
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,558
They weren't entirely human,
that could be...

415
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,790
I've looked at
every scenario
there is to think of.

416
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,030
Spell gone wrong,
doppelganger,

417
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,191
and, yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

418
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,113
But there is always
the chance that he did this,

419
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,429
intentionally.

420
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,350
(GRUNTS)

421
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,430
Good morning.

422
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,951
Painkillers would be nice.

423
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,111
Your surgery was
very successful.

424
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,952
Your wounds are closed.

425
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,633
Just one or two weeks of...

426
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
Hey. You're not
ready to walk around yet.

427
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,673
I was stabbed, woman,

428
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,114
I'm gonna find
the motherfucker who...

429
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,190
(GRUNTS)

430
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,152
Get Professor
Lipson down here!

(PANTING)

432
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,954
What?

433
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,077
It's spreading too
quickly to be an infection.

434
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,879
The wound is cursed.
Whatever it is,
it's growing under the skin.

435
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,832
He's lucky it's not
near any vital organs.

436
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,109
The necrotizing tissue...

437
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,235
Necrotizing?

438
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
Oh, cell death
within the tissue.

439
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,556
LIPSON: If it touches
something important...
How do you fix it?

440
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,558
(SIGHS) Without seeing
the knife, I...

441
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,319
I have no idea.

442
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,479
I hate magic.

443
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,874
QUENTIN: I mean, why us?

444
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,359
You, I get.

445
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,520
I think about
stabbing you all the time.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

446
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,357
That was 100% not a joke.

447
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,717
You realize that knife
was coming at me

448
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,996
before you jumped
in the way of it, right?

449
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,833
I owe you,
like, a Wookiee life debt.

450
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,479
Get a knife.
I'll stab you right now.

451
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,190
(SIGHS)

452
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,155
I keep thinking...

453
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,231
The Beast.
It makes sense.

454
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,833
And yet it doesn't.

455
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,836
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

456
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,515
Yeah.

457
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,799
Hey, do you want me to...

458
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,996
Uh... ls there anyone
you want me to call?

459
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,593
Parents, siblings,

460
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,191
parole officer?

461
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,119
I'm good.

462
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,634
No, Quentin.

463
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,711
She cared, she'd be here.

464
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,949
No visitors.

465
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,150
Two minutes.

466
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,470
What could he possibly
say that would make
you feel any better?

467
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,312
I'm not here to feel better.

468
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,994
Please?

469
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,069
I was supposed to
have a date last night.

470
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,154
I got all dressed up.

471
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,039
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,596
All this stuff
they're saying I did,
I don't remember.

473
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,193
You were blacked out.

474
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,276
Were you blacked
out when we met?

475
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,752
(FAINT MUSIC PLAYING
OVER HEADPHONES)

476
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,880
No, I don't want
to buy a bible.

477
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,950
(CHUCKLES)

478
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,435
What safe house were you in?

479
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,950
I recognized your ink.

480
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,758
You see it more
often than you'd think
in a place like this.

481
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,590
You're a Hedge?

482
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,074
No. Classically
trained, myself.

483
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,357
There's a special
school called Brakebills.

484
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,470
You heard of it?

485
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,151
Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

486
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,959
in here to get
away from magic, so...

487
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,074
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

488
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,676
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean.
It's not.

489
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,478
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

490
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,750
It's a gift.

491
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,116
Oh, God,
please don't
say "From God."

492

I'm not the guy
outside of the YMCA
yelling at people to repent.

493
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,193
Then what are you, Richard?

494
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,271
Okay, what we call "magic" is

495
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,030
a set of tools,

496
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,758
leftover from Creation.

497
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,072
Think about it.
(SCOFFS)

498
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,477
The power to bend reality,
to make and unmake.

499
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,837
Won't God be pissed
we touched His
tools without asking?

things by accident.

left for us to find.

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,880
Right.

506

you don't have
to take my word for it.

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,880
Like if you're messing around
with some loser who's

528
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,999
too obsessed with kids'
books to acknowledge
he even sees you.

529
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,349
Ripcord.

530
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,354
(INHALES SHARPLY)

531
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,269
Are you okay?

532
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,113
Can I do anything to help?

533
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,033
You want to help me?

534
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,713
Go to my room

535
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,679
and find the bag of pills
that's stashed under my desk.

536
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,397
Pills for what?
For... I'm a Traveler freak

537
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,876
who hears voices
and I do a little
or a lot of self-medicating

538
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,917
to get them to shut
their scream-holes.

539
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,475
Penny.
Uh...

540
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,358
Alice, I don't need
anyjudgment.

541
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,430
No, Penny.

542
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,960
Oh. Okay.

543
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,953
That's... That's not great.

544
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,599
ALICE: Can someone
get Quentin?

545
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,795
Now!

546
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,470
This is not what I pictured.

547
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,069
It's from the fourth
Fillory book.
(GROANS)

548
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,833
I read them all for research.

549
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,230
Yeah, Jane, um, she was alone
in Fillory for the first time

550
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,152
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

551
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,151
What's Lorian?
Uh, they're
the bad guys.

552
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,355
Uh, from
a neighboring kingdom.

553
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,595
It's actually
really interesting

554
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,910
because Fillory is both,
the name of the land mass

555
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,354
and also the one of
the sovereign states...

556
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,829
Quentin, focus, please.

557
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,115
Uh,yeah.

558
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,591
Um, so the Lorian, uh,
stabbed Jane with something
called a Virgo Blade.

559
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,672
And, uh, rose vines
grew from the wounds.

560
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,757
So, this seems to
be the way-grosser,
(GRUNTS)

561
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,831
less whimsical
version of that.

562
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,277
Uh, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

563
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,634
Honeyclaw?

564
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,915
Yeah. A talking bear.

565
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,070
Oh, Jesus.

566
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,276
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

567
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,716
until they strangled
her heart, um,
but Jane survived.

568
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,952
Penny, I know how to fix this.

569
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,839
ls that a turban?

570
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,918
No, it's your hair.

571
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,994
Sewing is not really my thing.

572
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,516
How is a voodoo doll
supposed to help me?

573
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,631
Uh, so, in the books,

574
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,916
Jane carries this
doll around with her
everywhere she goes,

575
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,877
and it looks just like her.

576
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,113
Uh, and so they realized that
the curse of the Virgo Blade

577
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,237
would accept
the doll as a substitute.

578
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,720
So we burn a doll?

579
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,195
(SIGHS)

580
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,591
Okay, what else does
your dumb book say?

581
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,514
Henry.

582
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,596
It is considered good form
to announce oneself
to blind people.

583
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,718
My glasses only show me
your outline, vaguely.

584
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,519
In my defense,
I was raised by
wolves for a time.

585
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,592
The knife that
Penny was stabbed with

586
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,309
is from Fillory.

587
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,600
Something called
the Virgo Blade.

588
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,835
And you are familiar?

589
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,876
Yes.

590
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,280
This is a first.

591
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,316
You should've called
for me much sooner.

592
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,392
Quentin's the most at risk,
but if Penny dies...

593
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,313
This is your mess, Eliza.

594
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,034
Clean it up.

595
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,636
Then get as far
away from my university
as possible.

596
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,473
Do you understand?

597
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,198
Mr. Goldwater, I don't have
a lot of time at the moment.

598
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,918
It is The Beast, isn't it?

599
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,911
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

600
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,399
Of course Fillory is real.

601
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,552
You've known that
since you were a child.
It's why you're here.

602
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,197
Okay, but there's no
Beast in the books.

603
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,840
The books are a child's
drawing of Fillory.

604
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,036
The real thing is stranger.

605
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,830
Yeah, it's full of
psychopathic monsters
who are trying to kill me.

606
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,513
You want to know
what The Beast wants?

607
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,994
I'll tell you exactly.

608
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,436
He wants control of Fillory
and all the doors
that lead there.

609
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,274
Maybe, he thinks
you'll find one of them.

610
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,629
I'm not a Traveler.

611
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,915
There are other ways.

612
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,519
I gave you a book about it.

613
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,432
<i>Fillory and Further, Book Six?</i>

614
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,669
I told you, I lost it.

615
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,717
And nothing lost
was ever found?

616
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,760
Wait, there's, uh...

617
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,314
What about Penny?
There's got to be
something we can do.

618
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,040
You need to read
between the lines, Quentin.

619
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,473
Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

620
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,034
ELIZA: <i>It was special because
of where it came from.</i>

621
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,996
<i>Jane's mother gave it to her</i>

622
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,677
<i>before she died.</i>

623
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,550
<i>It was all she took
with her to Fillory.</i>

624
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,031
<i>Her only reminder
of her family
and her life on Earth.</i>

625
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,830
<i>It was her most
precious possession.</i>

626
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,190
<i>What we love can be as
important to us as our lives.</i>

627
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,196
So, the curse
accepted the doll

628
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,399
as a proper sacrifice
in place of Jane's heart.

629
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,755
I know you have
more questions.

630
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,072
After you save your friend.

631
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,555
I found a way to
break the curse.
I just need a... Penny!

632
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,999
Hey, asshole, I need to know
your most precious possession.

633
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,196
He's been out of it for,
like, 20 minutes.

634
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,912
Then it's too late.

635
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,915
(SIGHS)

636
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,590
I beseech and devote myself.

637
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,078
I plead and promise myself

638
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,510
to you,

639
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,029
She of the Grain,

640
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,875
that you will raise
me up above the chaff.

641
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,754
Amen?

642
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,520
<i>When I met you</i>

643
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,558
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

644
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,074
I don't know.
Penny doesn't have
that much stuff,

645
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,719
we'll just to through it.

646
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,595
Pictures. Yeah, maybe
it's something from
his childhood, his family.

647
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,795
He doesn't ever
talk about them.

648
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,154
Doesn't mean he
doesn't care about them.

649
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,198
Penny's not the
most sentimental type.

650
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,591
Well, maybe he carefully
crafts that image,

651
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,432
I don't know.
Everyone is sentimental.

652
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,437
(SIGHS) You're projecting.
You're projecting!

653
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,394
Okay-

654
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,677
I'm getting a definite
circus clown vibe here.

655
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,390
Q, this is it.

656
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,549
You think Penny's most prized
possession is his Adderall?

657
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,439
If I had voices telling me
all day long to do dark magic
and, I don't know,

658
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,113
the pills were the one thing
that made them stop,

659
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,077
they'd be pretty precious.
You can always get more pills.

660
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,275
They're fungible.

661
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,555
You're fungible.

662
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,396
Okay, what's yours, hmm?

663
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,312
That's kind of a personal
question for two people

664
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,760
who aren't supposed
to be in the same room?

665
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,595
What's yours?

666
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,596
A quilt that my grandmother
made me when I was little.

667
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,589
It's covered in cats.

668
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,199
<i>FiIIory and Further,
Book One,</i> first <i>edition.</i>

669
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,314
I worked all summer
before eighth grade to get it.

670
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,959
It's predictable, I know.

671
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,238
Predictable's
not bad, Quentin.

672
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,755
Hey-

673
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,834
What about this?

674
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,229
A candy bar wrapper?

675
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,354
It's from Brakebills South.
This is the last
place that he saw Kady.

676
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,872
Quentin, I don't think Penny
even cares that she's gone.

677
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,189
Believe me, he does.

678
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,276
What was that?
That you gave me?

679
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,750
Did it work?

680
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,990
It didn't feel like I
was doing a casting,

681
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,993
it felt like a casting
was being done on me.

682
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,435
It's because it's not a spell,
it was a prayer.

683
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,636
TO what?
Local harvest deity.

684
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,313
Friendly,
and a little one-trick.

685
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,393
You're lucky she answered.
She's pretty shy.

686
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,279
It's like touching
a bare wire.

687
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,631
More energy than
I've ever felt.

688
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,710
It felt good.

689
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,276
It felt dangerous.

690
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,479
The reason you treat
magic like a drug,

691
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,392
is because the people
that taught it to you

692
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,800
act like drug dealers.

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,479
They buy it and they sell it,

694
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,794
and they fight
and they fuck for it.

695
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,679
But that's not
the only way to live.

696
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,432
That's the only
way I've ever seen.

697
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,149
I'm a very good Magician

698
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,319
and I do this.

699
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,878
There are good
people out there, Julia.

700
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,476
People trying to learn
about the world and make
it a better place.

701
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,312
Now, you could be
one of those people,

702
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,036
you could be a dealer,

703
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,113
you could stay here,
be nothing.

704
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,878
You get to choose.

705
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,560
(HEAVY BREATHING)

706
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,951
If I give you something,

707
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,550
you think you can get it
into Brakebills for me?

708
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,870
(SCOFFS)

709
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,758
Don't bother with
the performance.

710
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,714
Even with these wards,
I can see right through you.

711
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,350
I wouldn't dream
of fooling you.

712
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,590
I have far bigger
dreams than that.

713
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,840
Very clever,
targeting someone

714
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,513
outside the campus
protections.

715
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,152
Graduate with an alumni key.

716
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,710
Attractive, to a certain sort.

717
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,910
It won't work next time.

718
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,400
There won't be a next time.

719
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,919
You can't hide
in Fillory forever.

720
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,874
Lock as many
doors as you want,

721
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,837
there's always
a door to Fillory
when you need one.

722
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,513
Nothing's changed.

723
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,591
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

724
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,919
You know I never wanted this.

725
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,354
You forced my hand.

726
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,557
I wish it could
be any other way.
(LAUGHING)

727
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,517
I picked the Virgo Blade
especially for you, Jane.

728
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,113
Little twinge of nostalgia.

729
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,752
Penny's going to live
and this meat puppet of yours

730
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,275
is going to
a Salvadorian prison
in the morning.

731
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,033
All that scheming, wasted.

732
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,595
I could walk out of
here anytime I like.

733
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,633
If you can leave anytime,
then what are you waiting for?

734
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,634
Oh, I was waiting

735
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,910
for you.

Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

Dean Fogg.

748
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,274
What do we do?

749
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,353
What do we do?

750
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,279
I don't know.

751
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,035
<i>Fuck that.</i>

752
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,037
Eliza is dead. I...

753
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,391
When The Beast comes back,
what are we...

754
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,429
She is the only one
who could actually
give me answers.

755
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,393
There are no answers, Quentin.

756
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,354
Because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

757
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,712
Most likely outcome,

758
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,836
especially now
that he's gotten
Eliza out of the way,

759
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,754
you die,

760
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,238
your friends die,

761
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,719
we all die,

762
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,879
very bloody.

763
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,513
And all of this,

764
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,080
will have been for nothing.
