00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,285
So, now I just
wait till he is slain.

525
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,689
I'm so fucking bored,
children of Earth.

526
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,588
Ha!

527
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,961
I've had sex with every
nymph in the kingdom.

528
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,728
Well, we're here to help.

529
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,634
But you're not a nymph.

530
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,563
No, I'm...

531
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,736
What the fuck is wrong with you?

532
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:26,937
Pray pardon?

533
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,012
What are you doing here?

534
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,290
You're just going
to let The Beast

535
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,782
trample the shit out of Fillory?

536
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,045
You think that I
want to be here?

537
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,882
I think you're being
kind of a whiny bitch.

538
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:35,977
Q, maybe don't insult...

539
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,046
No, does he care, or not?

540
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,985
You're right.

541
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,129
Years trying to outwit him.

542
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,196
(CHUCKLES)

543
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,993
Greatest failure, deepest shame.

544
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,231
And now he is prepared
for anything I do.

545
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,969
It's not I who can
defeat him, not directly.

546
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,708
I'll do it.

547
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,982
I volunteer. I'll
kill The Beast.

548
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,885
I love Fillory. I
don't know why.

549
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,287
But I am supposed to be here.

550
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,752
I'm supposed to fight for it.

551
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,556
Can you be the champion
we've been waiting for?

552
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,791
I want to be.

553
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,161
I'm ready to be.

554
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,667
I'll do whatever it takes.

555
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,073
You love Fillory.

556
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,743
And you never stopped.

557
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,143
Julia stopped.

558
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,710
I mean, maybe in
college, but now I totally...

559
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,444
Yes, you see, she stopped.

560
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,050
But you never did.

561
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,989
Only the best and the purest

562
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,789
can face The Beast,

563
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,194
and that is you.

564
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,363
Right, okay, so
here's the thing,

565
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,925
I can't really touch the
knife that can kill The Beast.

566
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,334
Yes, you need my strength.

567
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,101
I will infuse you
with my essence.

568
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,377
I have gifted you my bestowal,

569
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,846
my largesse, the
seed of my power.

570
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,709
When you are ready
to face The Beast,

571
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,275
imbibe it.

572
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,150
JULIA: Is that semen?

573
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,521
Thank you.

574
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,922
Hmm. Thank you.

575
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,393
And you, daughter of Earth.

576
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,171
Hmm.

577
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,142
Your mind is encumbered.

578
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,271
A shroud.

579
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,505
No... What?

580
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,779
Crudely made.

581
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:42,974
Ember, no, it's okay...

582
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,243
I shall remove it.

583
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,340
JULIA: Remove what?

584
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,578
No, no, don't!

585
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,243
God. Jules!

586
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,954
You're welcome.
No need to thank me.

587
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,149
(GASPING)

588
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,419
Best of luck.

589
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,621
Oh, my God.

590
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,665
Jules... Please. Please, don't.

591
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,533
Please don't touch
me, please don't...

592
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,628
Okay.

593
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:10,665
Hey, Jules, come on. What
happened? Just tell me, please.

594
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,104
Can you take my memory?

595
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,612
Please, take my memory.

596
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,046
I don't know how.

597
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,283
Then we have to go.

598
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,617
QUENTIN: <i>I knew Julia wouldn't
tell me until she was ready,</i>

599
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,853
<i>but that might be never.</i>

600
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,065
(GASPS)

601
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,063
Here.

602
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,866
Thank you.

603
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:44,768
Any time.

604
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,156
Honestly, I was
getting pretty sick

605
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,046
of hearing your
voice in my head.

606
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:54,052
And I wanted to help
you so badly. I'm sorry I...

607
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,755
Don't be. You found me.

608
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,953
Look, is there some trick?

609
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,185
How do you take people along?

610
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,960
Any of us can.

611
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,524
Well, I can barely travel me.

612
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,834
They're a spell.

613
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,105
MARGO: Ugh. Literally?
QUENTIN: So, the dungeon?

614
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,273
Roaring success, and a twofer.

615
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:24,973
Sorry?

616
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,610
We should see if
he's awake by now.

617
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,324
QUENTIN: Oh, my God.

618
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,701
That's Christopher Plover.

619
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,895
What?

620
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,560
We were wrong about everything.

621
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,903
Plover's not The Beast.

622
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,634
No.

623
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,812
Martin Chatwin is.

624
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,344
I loved Martin.

625
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:06,948
But there's something black
inside him I failed to see.

626
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,755
Look at the
markings on his face.

627
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,793
Age suspension magic,

628
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,561
so every day he can start over.

629
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,296
Yeah, poor you.

630
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,631
ALICE: We need to find Martin.

631
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,866
Why? You can't stop him.

632
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,671
Tell us everything or

633
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,712
I'm going to feed you to him.

634
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,778
(EXHALES)

635
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,341
When he was still a child,

636
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,551
<i>Fillory stopped taking him.</i>

637
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,788
<i>Once he found his way back,
he made it his mission to stay.</i>

638
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,720
<i>He'd heard about the Wellspring,</i>

639
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,421
<i>the most ancient
location in Fillory.</i>

640
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,894
Which is what?

641
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,635
The source of all magic.

642
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:58,441
It's not only stronger than
Ember and Umber, it created them.

643
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,273
Fillory runs on it.

644
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,981
<i>Martin goes every
night to drink from it,</i>

645
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,519
<i>draining it a little
more each time.</i>

646
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,148
<i>The Wellspring's
magic is so strong,</i>

647
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:17,095
<i>it killed every
human thing in him.</i>

648
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,330
<i>There's only The Beast now.</i>

649
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,129
So, he goes to the Wellspring
every night, but it's not on any map.

650
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,894
(SIGHS) Guess I can
start asking around.

651
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,462
Or cast some kind
of locator maybe?

652
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,939
Or ask me.

653
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,172
He never could hide
his mind from me.

654
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,012
Our connection.

655
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,478
Okay, I vote we test
the knife out on him.

656
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,287
VICTORIA: Be careful.

657
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,953
Josh, come on. We've got to go.

658
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,496
Come on! JOSH:
I have your cloak...

659
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,555
QUENTIN: <i>Yeah,
Josh and Victoria bailed.</i>

660
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>On one hand, fuck them,</i>

661
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,328
<i>on the other hand, you
can't really blame them.</i>

662
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,471
<i>So, I was writing this down
because I didn't know much,</i>

663
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,842
<i>but I knew that I was
the hero of this story.</i>

664
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,771
<i>It all just felt like
the exact moment</i>

665
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,317
<i>that my entire life had
been building up to,</i>

666
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,286
<i>all of the reading,
and dreaming,</i>

667
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,551
<i>and loneliness, and magic.</i>

668
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,651
<i>All of it.</i>

669
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,188
<i>And then...</i>

670
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,095
<i>Well, and then this
story actually happened.</i>

671
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:30,659
<i>And I started to
realize the truth.</i>

672
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,595
It's so insignificant.

673
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,263
Us being together
and falling apart,

674
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,097
I mean, it just doesn't matter.

675
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,397
I made a mistake.

676
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,305
I know you don't want
to hear it, but I love you.

677
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,072
You're right, I don't.

678
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,681
But I'm not going to
go in there angry at you.

679
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,949
Okay? I've got your
back, Quentin. We all do.

680
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,181
You know, my entire life,

681
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,404
ever since the first time I
read <i>Fillory and Further,</i>

682
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,158
I've been waiting for some

683
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,697
powerful being to
come down and say,

684
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,760
"Quentin Coldwater,
you are the one."

685
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,902
Every book, every movie,

686
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,478
it's about one special guy.

687
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,908
He's chosen.

688
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,419
In real life, for every one guy,

689
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,423
there are a billion
people who aren't.

690
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,657
(LAUGHS)

691
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,584
Almost none of us are the one.

692
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,958
Ember said...

693
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:06,294
Ember is a little
out of touch, I think.

694
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,296
You're a better Magician.

695
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,165
And you're a better person.

696
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,943
And I think that
if he'd met you,

697
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,207
he wouldn't be so
sure that it's me.

698
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,875
But you're the one that they say

699
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,009
shows up every
single time, it's you.

700
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,986
I want to be the one. I do.

701
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,082
