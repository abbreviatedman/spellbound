1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,069
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:07,972
<i>This was Fillory,
a land of magic.</i>

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,035
<i>But the Chatwins,
they mostly get chased around</i>

4
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,044
<i>by this time witch,
The Watcherwoman.</i>

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,646
<i>She plants clocks in trees.</i>

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,878
<i>This is where Fillory was born,</i>

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,184
where Plover told tales
to Jane and Martin.

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,546
<i>I saw something in here.
Poor kid.</i>

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,485
<i>He was just trying
to get a button to Fillory,</i>

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,961
<i>you know, so he could escape
this monster.</i>

11
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>We live in a world
that is one world among many.</i>

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,399
<i>The Beast you saw
was from one such place.</i>

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,170
What does Jane have to do
with The Beast?

14
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:37,668
<i>Still the same determined,
little Jane Chatwin.</i>

15
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,871
<i>Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time,</i>

16
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,374
<i>and Jane used it
to create a time loop.</i>

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,706
<i>When she'd fail
to stop The Beast,</i>

18
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,712
<i>she'd restart the loop.</i>

19
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,383
What's different this time?

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,820
- I was at Brakebills?
- You were supposed to be.

21
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,389
I can't sit here now
and think it was anything but fate.

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,356
<i>We summoned a goddess.</i>

23
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:59,087
<i>She touched all of us.
She granted every petition.</i>

24
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,898
There was one time we didn't all die...
When we went to Fillory.

25
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,525
I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.

26
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:08,268
<i>The girl you saw in the dungeon?
We'll get her out.</i>

27
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,938
<i>We need some serious
battle magic.</i>

28
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,237
<i>Spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.</i>

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,535
- Bottling our emotions literally.
- Shall we go fuck some shit up?

30
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,035
You slept with two other people.
We broke up.

31
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:22,505
<i>I was out of my mind.
I made a mistake.</i>

32
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,346
<i>My friends, I just...</i>

33
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,221
<i>I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own.</i>

34
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,520
You want me
to come to Fillory with you?

35
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,222
Yeah.

36
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,264
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

37
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>"Fillory and Further.</i>

38
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,797
<i>Book seven."</i>

39
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>I will think
of a great title later.</i>

40
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,227
<i>I knew it started as a blob
of crazy magic energy</i>

41
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,429
<i>floating in space that gave birth
to the gods, Ember and Umber,</i>

42
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:15,768
<i>that gave birth
to this amazing place: Fillory.</i>

43
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,939
<i>And I even knew that
that place was real.</i>

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,968
What I didn't know was one day,

45
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:24,906
<i>I would actually go there
and seek out the gods themselves.</i>

46
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,412
Ember?

47
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,284
We need to talk to you.

48
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,445
Q, come on.
Put a little conviction in it.

49
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,685
Ember!

50
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,262
Okay.
Um, how did Martin summon him?

51
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,134
I don't know.
The books are all poetry.

52
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:49,332
It's like, "Martin's blood
sang to the gods."

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Em.

54
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,141
Q.

55
00:02:56,142 --> 00:03:01,115
- What if it was literal?
- That's worth a shot.

56
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,016
Damn it.

57
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,356
You okay?

58
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,701
No, I just stabbed my own hand.

59
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,870
Ah!

60
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:36,382
<i>We were expecting something amazing,
and it... it was amazing.</i>

61
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,218
<i>Just more the shitty kind.</i>

62
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,461
Smells like an outhouse in here.

63
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,492
Jeez, look at all this trash.

64
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,704
Someone's been holed up here
a while.

65
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,670
It is customary to bow,

66
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:00,071
Children of Earth.

67
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,120
Have you brought me
little cakes?

68
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,937
<i>You're probably
a little confused,</i>

69
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,809
<i>so now I'm gonna do
that thing I kinda hate</i>

70
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,938
<i>where the book rewinds
to fill in all the blanks.</i>

71
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,884
<i>Sorry.
Let's do it.</i>

72
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,587
Holy shit.

73
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,148
<i>Our route to Ember started</i>

74
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,086
<i>when we traveled
back in time to 1942</i>

75
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,226
<i>to follow Jane Chatwin through</i>

76
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,157
a vaguely tardis-looking portal
<i>to Fillory.</i>

77
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,730
Here she comes!

78
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,631
<i>We figured
once we were actually there,</i>

79
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,802
<i>we could get to the present
and back to my friends somehow,</i>

80
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,903
<i>'cause that's Fillory.</i>

81
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,135
<i>There's always a way.</i>

82
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,241
<i>There's Jane, and there's us,</i>

83
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,843
<i>and someone mysterious
watching us, by the way,</i>

84
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,316
<i>to follow us through.</i>

85
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,686
<i>Standing in Fillory was
the greatest moment of my life,</i>

86
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,947
<i>and not just because,
as I later found out,</i>

87
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,815
<i>the air is .02% opium,</i>

88
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,294
<i>which is a pretty unfair trick
to get you to love a place,</i>

89
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:29,193
<i>but, whatever, we loved it.</i>

90
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>Oh, uh, oh, so...
If you're a real fan,</i>

91
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,371
<i>you totally recognize this
from the books...</i>

92
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:38,200
<i>This iconic scene, right?</i>

93
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,205
<i>Jane falls into a trap and
is saved by passing magicians,</i>

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:46,346
<i>but you didn't know is
I am in that scene, bitches.</i>

95
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,477
Struggle, struggle.
Tighter, tighter.

96
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,718
Okay, do you see them yet?

97
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,319
Nope, but they can't be
too hard to miss.

98
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,822
The Witch and The Fool.
Iconic.

99
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:02,056
How are The Witch and The Fool
supposed to see her...

100
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,067
Oh!

101
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,468
Ooh, which one
do you think I am?

102
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,976
You don't look like any
witches or fools I've seen here.

103
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:22,350
Oh, wait. Don't. It's... it's enchanted.
It'll only make it worse.

104
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:25,247
What's the point of these anyway?
They're everywhere.

105
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,654
Well, some animals can talk, so hunters
have sort of an ethical dilemma.

106
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,425
You know, you don't want to eat
something as smart as you,

107
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:37,397
so anything that can answer the riddle
is set free.

108
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:42,768
So, uh, "what is no sooner
broken than spoken?"

109
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,444
I have no idea.

110
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,067
Silence.

111
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,151
Silence.

112
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,175
How'd you know the answer?

113
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,915
I, uh... read it.

114
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,289
Brilliant.
Thank you, Witch and Fool.

115
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,692
Ta-ta!

116
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,696
Okay...
Go.

117
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,500
Geek out. We're in the books.
We are in the books.

118
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,636
<i>So remember how someone
followed us into Fillory?</i>

119
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,207
Hey, are you following us?

120
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,208
It's totally cool if you are.

121
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,776
Martin? He's not even
in this part of the book.

122
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,057
Still not sure I quite understand
why you were following my sister.

123
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,459
Well, why are you following
your sister?

124
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,598
'Cause Fillory stopped
taking you?

125
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,400
Martin, I know you probably think
it's your fault, but it's not.

126
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,673
You want to be here because
you don't feel safe at home.

127
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,742
And we want to help.

128
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,578
What do you mean?

129
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,482
Christopher Plover is
a very powerful magician now.

130
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,083
Maybe the most.

131
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,854
We think we can stop him
if we find something.

132
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:10,092
Um, it's a Fillorian knife,
called the Leo Blade.

133
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:15,762
- Have you heard of it?
- No, but I know someone who might've.

134
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,297
Nope, never heard of it.

135
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,773
But it's something you're
more than capable of making,

136
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:28,140
given your reputation.

137
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,675
Though if you think it may be
too difficult...

138
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,776
What in Hades is difficult
about a blade?

139
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,978
- Well, this one...
- Has to kill a Master Magician.

140
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,051
And he's not even human anymore.

141
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:40,350
Six fingers,
dark spells you've never seen before.

142
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,122
Lad, fetch the moonstones.

143
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:48,058
Thing like that can only be killed
with a blade of moonstones.

144
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,667
I have the only two in Fillory.

145
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,398
You couldn't even make
a needle with that.

146
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:00,039
These aren't just rocks.
They're alive.

147
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,476
I can mate them and breed more.

148
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,377
Then why haven't you?

149
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,680
Expensive.
Takes time.

150
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,652
Care, feeding.
Years.

151
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,423
And it's not often
I'm called upon

152
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:17,921
to forge a Master Magician
murder weapon.

153
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:22,555
But you are from a place
that likes murder: Earth.

154
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,363
- Am I right?
- Yes, we're from Earth.

155
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,404
Good.
Then you know what I want.

156
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:29,230
We do, and we agree.

157
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,236
So what exactly did we promise
The Knifemaker last night?

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,909
Well, he knew
we were from Earth.

159
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,008
And the rulers of Fillory
can only be from Earth.

160
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,340
So he thinks we're...

161
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,346
Kings and Queen.
He wants a seat at court.

162
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,519
But years, it'll take him years.

163
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,078
How...

164
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,557
Holy shit.

165
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,461
Oh, my god.

166
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,766
Jules, it's Ember's temple.

167
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,768
<i>It was as beautiful
as it was in the books,</i>

168
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,570
<i>and standing there,
you could just feel</i>

169
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,542
<i>that the gods were real.</i>

170
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:13,646
<i>But in Fillory,
with magic comes danger.</i>

171
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,777
She's coming!
The Watcherwoman!

172
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,751
Martin.
Wait.

173
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,552
Martin!

174
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,364
Holy shit.

175
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,967
<i>In which we run into my
favorite random, scary villain</i>

176
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,443
<i>from the books and she turns
out to be the exact opposite.</i>

177
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,012
Quentin?

178
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,648
You know The Watcherwoman?

179
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,516
Oh, my god.
I do.

180
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,117
Of course, I should have
put that together.

181
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,920
Uh, this is my friend, Julia.

182
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:59,491
Julia, this is Jane Chatwin
all grown up.

183
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,463
You're not supposed
to be here yet.

184
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:03,661
Haven't even been born yet.

185
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,334
We know about time loops
that you keep making.

186
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:07,833
Well, as you should by now.

187
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,434
Right.

188
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,296
So there have been 39 others...

189
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,040
And you're the volunteer tomato.

190
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,441
I'm sorry, what?

191
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,442
In a garden,
you pull everything up.

192
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,184
Sometimes a stray vine
just keeps coming back.

193
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,648
It volunteers.

194
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,218
That's really why you,
Quentin, you just keep coming.

195
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,519
Right.
Okay.

196
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:33,159
So, okay... I'm the tomato.

197
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,460
And this is the last time.

198
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,862
Why is this the last one?

199
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,404
Oh...

200
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,373
Uh, well you die this time.

201
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,708
Huh.

202
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,709
I see.

203
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,581
Do I die doing something brave?

204
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:55,209
- Very.
- Right, then.

205
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,415
If you survive, see to it that
I get a proper temple in my honor.

206
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,748
Granite statue, good likeness,
mind the chin.

207
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,389
I'll put that
at the top of my list.

208
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,990
Can I ask a question?

209
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,861
Why are you The Watcherwoman,
she's a villain?

210
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,262
Am I?

211
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,501
I mean, you scared the hell
out of everybody.

212
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:15,429
Well, when I was a girl,
The Watcherwoman inspired me

213
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,535
to learn magic to fight her.

214
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:21,372
Indeed, I grew up to be just
a touch stronger than that Watcherwoman.

215
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:26,340
- That hurts my brain.
- Apparently wasn't enough.

216
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,708
Least I learned some fun things,
like this.

217
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,756
Wait, what did you do?

218
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,362
Don't want her to hear us.

219
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,132
There's a patch on your
friend's memory, quite crude.

220
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,696
Made in haste, likely by a Hedge.

221
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:57,037
- Could you remove it?
- No, it's there for a reason.

222
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:04,545
<i>Covering something
recent, something tragic...</i>

223
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,987
<i>Replacing it with something
beautiful but false.</i>

224
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,333
My children,
you have summoned me

225
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:26,067
to shed your burdens
and so they shall be.

226
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,806
Julia.

227
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,484
<i>I have a mission for you.</i>

228
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,415
- If you still care about her...
- Of course.

229
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,458
Protect her.

230
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:52,358
- I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.
- That was never your job, Quentin.

231
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,565
Right, then.

232
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,969
Sorry, what were you guys saying?

233
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:03,514
So, Jane, um, could you zoom us forward
to the present... our present?

234
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,909
Good-bye, Quentin.

235
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,515
Godspeed.

236
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,321
Jesus...

237
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,658
<i>Welcome to Fillory 2016.</i>

238
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,789
It's a lot colder.

239
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,325
It's like being in a fog
that never lifts.

240
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,231
Yeah.

241
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,803
Ow.
Jesus.

242
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,581
"Enchanted this to find you
if you ever arrive.

243
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,707
"Hope you're not dead.

244
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,913
"Margo being such a bitch.

245
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,415
Follow map to find us.
El."

246
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,248
Come on.

247
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:51,885
<i>Welcome to the Fillory
of The Beast.</i>

248
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,659
<i>And this is what happens</i>

249
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,860
<i>to a world ruled by
the worst kind of predator...</i>

250
00:14:55,862 --> 00:15:00,566
<i>The kind of monster
who destroys childhood.</i>

251
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,865
Cheers, B.

252
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,784
<i>As soon as I saw them,
I remembered,</i>

253
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:15,779
<i>"oh, we kind of
all slept with each other</i>

254
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,422
"and hate each other right now.

255
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,847
<i>And that is largely my fault."</i>

256
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,023
Really good to see you again, Q,

257
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:26,191
but, um, why am I looking
at the Hedgebitch who tried to kill you?

258
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,692
We worked it out.

259
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,463
I wouldn't be here
without her, so...

260
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,862
I'm here.
You don't have to like me.

261
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:36,174
Oh, don't you worry.
We don't.

262
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,641
So do you know where The Beast
is holding Victoria or not?

263
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,211
I think the dungeon is in
The Castle that isn't there.

264
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,082
That's the stupidest name
I've ever heard.

265
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,420
You didn't just do shots with
a bulldog named Bristlycoat.

266
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:55,487
It's a kind of phosphoromancy.
Alice, you could explain it...

267
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,488
Um, better.

268
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,129
How much further to this knifemaker?
These shoes weren't cobbled for a quest.

269
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,999
- Right over here, I think.
- Not another one.

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,598
- What?
- They're everywhere.

271
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:14,306
Plus headstones,
unmarked graves.

272
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,976
Oh, no.

273
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,477
<i>We'd hoped that Martin
was still out there somewhere,</i>

274
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,479
<i>that we could save him,
but we took too long.</i>

275
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,750
<i>We failed him.</i>

276
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,119
All the Chatwins are dead.

277
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,690
Wow, your childhood fantasy
is a great big magical Dachau.

278
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,276
<i>The Knifemaker's house
was largely the same in 2016,</i>

279
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,385
<i>but now it was run
by a stranger.</i>

280
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,889
I remember you.

281
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,391
I must say, you've aged well,
the two of you.

282
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,994
Um...

283
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,055
I was eight.
Apprentice to my father.

284
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,825
Is he around?

285
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,469
He's out back.
Six feet under grass.

286
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,665
You know, he grew a little aggravated
waiting for you two to come back.

287
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,291
The Leo Blade, as promised.

288
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,092
Payment is due.

289
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,361
As promised.

290
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,532
Here's the thing:
All the Chatwins are dead,

291
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,731
Fillory has no rulers,
and the only people from Earth

292
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,271
left here now not locked
in a dungeon...

293
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:51,599
Oh, my god.
I'm going to be royalty.

294
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,840
Yeah, I mean,
we all are the next wave.

295
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:58,377
So what he wants is to become
future royalty by marriage.

296
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,678
- Wait, he wants to marry one of us?
- No, thank god.

297
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,684
He wants one of us
to marry her... his daughter.

298
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,915
Huh.

299
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,351
I mean, you know,
team player and stuff.

300
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,586
Hey, who says it's you anyway?

301
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,092
It's not a volunteer gig,
and she doesn't get to pick.

302
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:21,566
This blade draws one thing
and one thing only:

303
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,368
the pure royal blood
of the High King of Fillory.

304
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:29,771
I admit, I was 100% sure that
I was definitely the High King.

305
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,246
Hm.

306
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,707
<i>I know!
Shocking, right?</i>

307
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:40,051
<i>You may be wondering why they set it up
that aliens must rule Fillory</i>

308
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:46,091
<i>and I'm sure there is a great reason
and nobody has any clue what that is.</i>

309
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,795
<i>Ember and Umber set it up and they're
not that into explaining their big ideas</i>

310
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,627
<i>and, you know, you'd think it would
be centaurs or something, right?</i>

311
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,232
<i>I would do centaurs, but nope.</i>

312
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,465
So what exactly is supposed to...

313
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,271
Oh!

314
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,074
Get the fuck out.

315
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,636
Well, High King.

316
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,505
Makes certain instinctual sense,
I guess.

317
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,145
Your majesty.

318
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,220
Oh, this'll make him
easier to live with.

319
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,162
So there's a bump.

320
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,167
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

321
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:32,100
Apparently marriage here
is different. Really different.

322
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:35,640
Right, but as high king,
I can get, like, a royal annulment.

323
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,477
No, never.

324
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,848
Once you get married, you won't
be able to be with anyone else

325
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,449
literally
for the rest of your life.

326
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,451
Here, but when I go back,
I can...

327
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,426
I can never leave Fillory.

328
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,457
Jesus.

329
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:01,225
- El, you don't have to do this.
- No, don't.

330
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,637
I'm doing this.

331
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,878
- Eliot...
- Margo.

332
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,247
I am miserable.

333
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:19,480
My life, it doesn't work.
Nothing's ever fixed that.

334
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:24,185
Drugs, sex, food, booze.
Not even magic.

335
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,326
But maybe it all led to this,
to now,

336
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,490
for a reason that's actually
finally going to make my life

337
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:34,699
not just about me, and my thoughts,
and my feelings, something...

338
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,530
Bigger.

339
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:43,165
How wise you are,
Queen Margo The Destroyer.

340
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,514
Um...

341
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,289
Is it okay if I hate
that you're getting married?

342
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,191
Shit.

343
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,162
I think you're the only person
that I can stand.

344
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,933
You know what that means?

345
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:08,631
You have to be my best man.

346
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,865
God.

347
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,979
This is taking forever.

348
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,317
Penny!

349
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,959
- Eliot.
- Fen.

350
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:39,460
Nice to meet you.
Will you marry me?

351
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,948
Okay, okay, where are you?

352
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,279
Where is this?

353
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,127
The blade is yours.

354
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,471
- Ha!
- What?

355
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,039
That's hot.

356
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,670
Here, maybe
it's just for high kings.

357
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,835
Oh, Jesus!

358
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,305
Okay, father-in-law,
why is this blade 1,000 degrees?

359
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,045
It may only be handled by
master magicians.

360
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,981
Are none of you masters?

361
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,916
Okay, I found the castle.
We can...

362
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,352
Oh, cool!

363
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,026
I hate this place!

364
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,936
There has to be a trick, right?

365
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,567
We can't trick it into
thinking we're powerful.

366
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,242
I mean, the trick is
we have to be that powerful.

367
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,970
I gather the crowd
you usually hang with

368
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,405
nods like you're smart when
you say incredibly obvious shit,

369
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,111
but what we need is ideas.

370
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,913
That's a good idea.
We need the power of a god.

371
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,282
Yeah, or gods.
Ember and Umber.

372
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,252
Who haven't been seen for
decades, so good luck with that.

373
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,491
Okay, I have a much less
idiotic idea.

374
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:12,214
Why don't we use a magician
who's actually been around The Beast...

375
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:13,815
The girl from his dungeon.

376
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,086
So much less idiotic
it's almost good.

377
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:20,661
- I'm with Penny.
- Eliot?

378
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,296
Yeah, according to the fine
print not actually written down,

379
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,743
I have a virgin farm girl
to impregnate.

380
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:29,907
- Right this second?
- This very one.

381
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,511
Best of luck, all.
You're welcome.

382
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,176
Mrs. Me?

383
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,190
If I die while
he's balling himself limp,

384
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,191
I will haunt
the shit out of his ass.

385
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,639
You're fucking kidding me.

386
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,199
That's why they call it
The Castle That Isn't There,

387
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,799
'cause it's invisible.

388
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
<i>The truth is,
the castle was constructed</i>

389
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,340
<i>to be invisible primarily
for budgetary reasons.</i>

390
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,638
<i>The royals had spent their
entire seasonal allowance</i>

391
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,179
<i>and then realized they still
had a castle to build,</i>

392
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,446
<i>so they figured builder's grade material
is just fine if you can't see it.</i>

393
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,446
- You guys run, I'll distract 'em.
- Don't be stupid. They're men.

394
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,094
My sister!
Please, help!

395
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,885
She just fainted.
Can one of you do something?

396
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:25,825
Hey, hey.

397
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,227
I need help.

398
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:33,567
- You all right, miss?
- Where am I?

399
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,650
Victoria.

400
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,587
Whoa... hey, hey.

401
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,018
Hey, we're here to get you out.
Okay, we're here to get you out.

402
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,058
The cuffs...
I can't...

403
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,860
- They keep you from travelling.
- Yeah.

404
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:59,060
We'll get 'em.
Can you walk?

405
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,965
There's someone else
in the next cell.

406
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,871
Ember?
We need to talk to you.

407
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:12,911
<i>So here we are at the temple,
hoping against hope and all that.</i>

408
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,852
Ah!

409
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:25,122
It is customary to bow,
Children of Earth.

410
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,936
Have you brought me
little cakes?

411
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,197
- No.
- Uh...

412
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,706
We didn't really know
that we were supposed to.

413
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,438
Oh.

414
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:48,280
And I am so tired
of eating mice.

415
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:53,282
No matter.

416
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:57,316
And you are?

417
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:01,993
Uh, I'm Quentin Coldwater.
And Julia Wicker.

418
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:06,764
Huh. Spank my cheeks.
You're usually dead by now.

419
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:12,136
He kills you and I'm left here
to hide like an animal

420
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:19,078
in horrid, arid, cake-deficient loria,
but you're here.

421
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,279
What happened?

422
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,781
What are you...
What are you doing here?

423
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:27,919
He lured me into a trap,
of course.

424
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,320
The Beast?

425
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,957
As you call him, yes.

426
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:36,158
He snared me
and my dead, departed Umber.

427
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:40,160
- Wait, Umber's dead?
- It's unseemly, all of it.

428
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,769
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to disrespect,

429
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,106
but how could a magician
put the drop on you?

430
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:52,610
Fillory's magic belongs to no one,
not even a god.

431
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,212
A magician
with enough determination

432
00:26:55,214 --> 00:27:00,518
can harness its forces and make
haggis of any one of us.

433
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,849
Hm.

434
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:05,523
So now I just wait
till he is slain.

435
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,860
I'm so fucking bored,
Children of Earth.

436
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,391
Ha!

437
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,726
I've had sex with every nymph
in the kingdom.

438
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:16,801
Well, we're here to help.

439
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,802
But you're not a nymph.

440
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,444
No, I'm...

441
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,176
What the fuck is wrong with you?

442
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,746
- Pray pardon?
- What are you doing here?

443
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,507
You're just gonna let The Beast
trample the shit out of Fillory?

444
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,516
You think that
I want to be here?

445
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,488
I think you're being
kind of a whiny bitch.

446
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:38,223
- Q, maybe don't insult him...
- No, does he care or not?

447
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,894
You're right.

448
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,086
Years trying to outwit him.

449
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,766
Greatest failure, deepest shame.

450
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:51,597
And now he is prepared
for anything I do.

451
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:56,267
It's not I who can defeat him,
not directly.

452
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:07,083
I'll do it. I volunteer.
I'll kill The Beast.

453
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:12,221
I love Fillory. I don't know why.
But I am supposed to be here.

454
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,192
I'm supposed to fight for it.

455
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,229
Can you be the champion
we've been waiting for?

456
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,897
I want to be.
I'm ready to be.

457
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,443
I'll do whatever it takes.

458
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:29,708
You love Fillory.

459
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,644
And you never stopped.
Julia stopped.

460
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:36,206
I mean, maybe in college,
but now I totally...

461
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,945
Yes, you see, she stopped.

462
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:43,052
But you never did.

463
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:48,985
Only the best and the purest
can face The Beast,

464
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:52,597
and that is you.

465
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,228
Right, okay,
so here's the thing,

466
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,603
I can't really touch the knife
that can kill The Beast.

467
00:28:56,604 --> 00:29:03,439
Yes, you need my strength.
I will infuse you with... my essence.

468
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:08,747
I have gifted you my bestowal,
my largesse, the seed of my power.

469
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:14,586
When you are ready
to face The Beast, imbibe it.

470
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:17,217
Is that semen?

471
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,155
Thank you.

472
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:28,495
Thank you.
And you, Daughter of Earth.

473
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,265
Hm.

474
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,776
Your mind is encumbered.

475
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,007
A shroud.

476
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,378
- No...
- What?

477
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,479
- Crudely made.
- Ember, no, it's okay...

478
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,781
- I shall remove it.
- Remove what?

479
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,184
No, no, don't!

480
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,445
Oh, god.
Jules!

481
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,554
You're welcome.
No need to thank me.

482
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,591
Best of luck.

483
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,732
- Jules...
- Please.

484
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,301
Please, don't...

485
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,940
Please don't touch me,
please don't...

486
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:07,906
Hey, hey. Jules, come on.
What happened?

487
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,307
Just tell me, please.

488
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,778
Can you take my memory?
Please, take my memory.

489
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,809
I don't know how.

490
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:25,017
I may have to go.

491
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,864
<i>I knew Julia wouldn't tell me
until she was ready,</i>

492
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,528
<i>but that might be never.</i>

493
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,770
Here.

494
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,271
- Thank you.
- Any time.

495
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,809
Honestly, I was getting pretty sick
of hearing your voice in my head.

496
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:53,117
I wanted to help you so badly.
I'm sorry I...

497
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:57,047
Don't be.
You found me.

498
00:30:57,056 --> 00:31:02,385
Look, is there some trick?
How do you take people along?

499
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:06,800
- Any of us can.
- Well, I-I can barely travel me.

500
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,473
They're a spell.

501
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,875
Ew.
Literally?

502
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:22,909
- So the dungeon?
- Roaring success, and a twofer.

503
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,345
Sorry?

504
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,651
We should see
if he's awake by now.

505
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,097
Oh, my god.

506
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,228
- That's Christopher Plover.
- What?

507
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:48,170
We were wrong about everything.
Plover's not The Beast.

508
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,242
No.

509
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,911
Martin Chatwin is.

510
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,618
I loved Martin.

511
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,920
But there's something black
inside him I failed to see.

512
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,185
Look at the markings
on his face.

513
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,528
Age suspension magic,

514
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:15,029
so every day he can start over.

515
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:18,636
- Yeah, poor you.
- We need to find Martin.

516
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,906
Why?
You can't stop him.

517
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:25,907
Tell us everything or
I'm going to feed you to him.

518
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,749
When he was still a child,
Fillory stopped taking him.

519
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:38,957
<i>Once he found his way back,
he made it his mission to stay.</i>

520
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:45,330
<i>He'd heard about the Wellspring,
the most ancient location in Fillory.</i>

521
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:51,502
- Which is what?
- The source of all magic.

522
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:57,508
It's not only stronger than
Ember and Umber, it created them.

523
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,278
Fillory runs on it.

524
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,009
<i>Martin goes every night
to drink from it,</i>

525
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:07,576
<i>draining it a little more
each time.</i>

526
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:11,456
<i>The Wellspring's magic
is so strong</i>

527
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,957
<i>it killed...</i>

528
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,427
<i>Every human thing in him.</i>

529
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,858
<i>There's only The Beast now.</i>

530
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:22,666
So he goes to the Wellspring
every night, but it's not on any map.

531
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:26,767
- Guess I can start asking around.
- Or cast some kind of locator maybe?

532
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,407
Or ask me.

533
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:32,678
He never could hide his mind
from me.

534
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,279
Our connection.

535
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:40,251
Okay, I vote we test the knife
out on him.

536
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:48,959
- We gotta be careful with this, shh.
- Josh come on we gotta go.

537
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:53,596
<i>Yeah, Josh and Victoria bailed.
On one hand, fuck 'em,</i>

538
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:57,002
<i>on the other hand,
you can't really blame 'em.</i>

539
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,765
<i>So I was writing this down
because I didn't know much,</i>

540
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:05,410
<i>but I knew that I was the hero
of this story.</i>

541
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,981
<i>It all just felt like
the exact moment</i>

542
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:10,550
<i>that my entire life
had been building up to,</i>

543
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,749
<i>all of the reading,
and dreaming,</i>

544
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:17,452
<i>and loneliness, and magic.</i>

545
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:20,216
<i>All of it.</i>

546
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,885
<i>And then...</i>

547
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,494
<i>Well, and then this story
actually happened.</i>

548
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:29,026
<i>And I started
to realize the truth.</i>

549
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,528
It's so insignificant...

550
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,164
Us being together and falling apart,
I mean, it just doesn't matter.

551
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,496
I made a mistake.

552
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,540
I know you don't want to
hear it, but I love you.

553
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,710
You're right, I don't.

554
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:17,681
But I'm not gonna go in there
angry at you.

555
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:22,520
Okay, I've got your back,
Quentin. We all do.

556
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:26,491
You know, my entire life,

557
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,662
ever since the first time I read
"Fillory and Further,"

558
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:32,560
I've been waiting for some
powerful being

559
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:37,531
to come down and say,
"Quentin Coldwater, you are the one."

560
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:48,749
Every book, every movie,
it's about one special guy.

561
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,150
He's chosen.

562
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:56,851
In real life, for every one guy,
there are a billion people who aren't.

563
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,355
- Almost none of us are the one.
- Ember said...

564
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,900
Ember is a little
out of touch, I think.

565
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:16,507
You're a better magician.
And you're a better person.

566
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,940
And I think that if he'd met you,
he wouldn't be so sure that it's me.

567
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:25,581
But you're the one that they say
shows up every single time, it's you.

568
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:30,353
I want to be the one. I do.
It's just...

569
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,025
It's the adult part of me, the part of me
that understands how magic works,

570
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:37,928
it just... it just keeps screaming
that it's you.

571
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,642
Every time that Jane reset the loop,
she changed something.

572
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:53,736
So what if I change something?
What if I give the blade to you?

573
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:06,557
You're not as good as I hoped,
Quentin Coldwater.

574
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,930
But you're better than you know.

575
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,071
- Alice, you okay?
- Come on, hon.

576
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,712
Pretend it's prom night and
you just want to shut him up.

577
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,285
Did you bogart the whole thing?

578
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,493
Alice?

579
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,049
Q, uh, can I...
Can I talk to you?

580
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,290
Jules. Talk to me.

581
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,728
I did something.
Me and my friends.

582
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,729
We followed all the clues.

583
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:26,895
We thought that she was leading us
to her. We summoned her.

584
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:31,065
You know, I actually believed
our lady underground chose me.

585
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,490
Guys, stop.
We should stop.

586
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,326
Julia.
You dumb little witch.

587
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:59,165
You can't unring a bell.

588
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,512
Richard. Move!
Richard, move!

589
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,348
- Stop her!
- Do something.

590
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,019
- Can't use my magic.
- Nothing's working.

591
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,816
Oh, god.

592
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,055
You'll find I've taken away your magic,
so there's no point in trying.

593
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,366
My thanks for opening the door.

594
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:32,536
You may address me as Reynard the Fox,
trickster of the faithful,

595
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:37,141
the pure of heart,
the very stupid.

596
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,382
Richard...

597
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,087
No, no!

598
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,328
Kady...

599
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,597
Julia, run, run.

600
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:02,828
Kady, that was my hermit
who healed your heart.

601
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,337
And now, I'm going to taste it.

602
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:10,169
- Don't you fucking touch her.
- When you address me...

603
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:12,575
Avert your gaze.

604
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:18,748
- I said, "don't you fucking touch her."
- Fine. I'll take you first.

605
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,651
Kady, go!

606
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,591
I chose you, Julia.

607
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,928
From the first moment
you prayed,

608
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,359
I felt your body.

609
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:35,795
I lifted it in my hands.

610
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,784
I can give you the greatest
pleasure of your life.

611
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:53,382
I can make you...

612
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:56,045
Ow!

613
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,636
I need your help.
Something happened.

614
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,652
Jesus.

615
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,193
Thank you for coming.

616
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,390
- Whoa...
- I got you. I got you.

617
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:41,701
The thing, where is it now?

618
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:48,606
Gone. Got what it wanted.
I didn't know who else to call.

619
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,111
You called the right person.
I'm gonna help you clean this up.

620
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:53,577
I'm gonna need another favor.

621
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,447
And I know it'll cost me,
but I don't care.

622
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:59,048
Jesus, Julia, I want to help.

623
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:06,257
What Brakebills did to your memory?
I need you to do it to me.

624
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,588
Please.

625
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,931
Jules.

626
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,069
Yeah, I know.
What the fuck were we thinking?

627
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,637
You were trying to do good,
and you got duped.

628
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,269
It's not your fault.

629
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:28,110
- Jules, you saved Kady.
- Yeah, but what about everyone else?

630
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,209
You know, what...

631
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,494
Hey.

632
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,759
I'm going to help you.

633
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,166
- I promise, whatever that means.
- It means find him.

634
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:53,937
It means kill him.

635
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:59,137
And somehow I doubt that
that's easy, or even possible.

636
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:02,484
Well, impossible shit
is sort of our thing.

637
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:23,634
The Wellspring of all magic?
It's a truck stop shit-house.

638
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,800
He'll be here soon.
Let's go.

639
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:13,677
- The fuck?
- It's Plover's writing room.

640
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:17,623
All that power, and he can't stop
thinking about where it happened.

641
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:20,958
Fillory needs meds
way more than magic.

642
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,859
Okay, so.

643
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:25,629
Where's the actual Wellspring?

644
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,830
Poor Martin.

645
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,801
Okay, so...

646
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:38,942
Quentin.

647
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:42,113
Is it time for this already?

648
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,119
Hi, Martin.
We know it's you.

649
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,056
Mm.

650
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:58,593
Well, you made it a good
long way this time around.

651
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,166
But this is it, Quentin.

652
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:08,906
I know you're still in there.
Look at this.

653
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:10,667
You still feel,
you're still hurt,

654
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,635
and you should be
after what happened to you.

655
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,246
You mediocre are always
so sentimental.

656
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:23,986
Although, must say, most wouldn't walk
to certain death 40 times in a row.

657
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,417
You're no quitter.

658
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,586
Mm.

659
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,429
Right.

660
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:38,998
- Let's get this over with.
- Wait. I have an offer.

661
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:42,072
Jane gave me a message for you,

662
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,408
a... a gift.

663
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:49,046
She said that you would want it,
that you would understand.

664
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:56,852
Your stupid bloody cards.

665
00:45:56,855 --> 00:46:01,285
Your stalling tactics haven't
gotten any less pathetic.

666
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,092
Next time, put something useful
in your pocket.

667
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,795
Oh, that's right.
No next time.

668
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,730
Shit!

669
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:15,238
You're stronger than you were.

670
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,976
Haven't learned to cast
while you're bleeding out?

671
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:24,648
Oh, for the love of Christ,
children...

672
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,289
Aah!

673
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,960
Now...

674
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,997
Quentin Coldwater.

675
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,336
Wait.

676
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,851
I need...

677
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,022
I need your help.
Something happened.

678
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,421
Ow!

679
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:21,469
Something's still happening.

680
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:30,946
Stronger as well, I see.
So many surprises.

681
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,317
So.

682
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:35,986
What do you want?

683
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:39,517
Jules.

684
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,824
You killed Umber.

685
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,656
And you trapped Ember.

686
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:48,127
You know how to deal with gods.
You know how to fuck up their shit.

687
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:54,037
- Julia. No.
- I want to make a deal.

688
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,568
Let's.

689
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,459
Oh, god.
