00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,044
can harness its forces

521
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,044
and make haggis
of any one of us.

522
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,481
Hmm.

523
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,929
So, now I just wait
till he is slain.

524
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,325
I'm so fucking bored,
children of Earth.

525
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,206
Ha!

526
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,601
I've had sex with every
nymph in the kingdom.

527
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,411
Well, we're
here to help.

528
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,285
But you're not a nymph.

529
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,250
No, I'm...

530
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,404
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

531
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,567
Pray pardon?

532
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,641
What are you
doing here?

533
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,846
You're just going
to let The Beast

534
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,410
trample the shit
out of Fillory?

535
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,642
You think that I
want to be here?

536
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,484
I think you're being
kind of a whiny bitch.

537
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,607
Q, maybe don't insult...

538
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,682
No, does he care,
or not?

539
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,601
You're right.

540
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,763
Years trying to
outwit him.

541
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,841
(CHUCKLES)

542
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,645
Greatest failure,
deepest shame.

543
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,891
And now he is prepared
for anything I do.

544
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,606
It's not I who can
defeat him, not directly.

545
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,361
I'll do it.

546
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,607
I volunteer.
I'll kill The Beast.

547
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,525
I love Fillory.
I don't know why.

548
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,921
But I am supposed
to be here.

549
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,408
I'm supposed
to fight for it.

550
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,207
Can you be the champion
we've been waiting for?

551
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,441
I want to be.

552
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,806
I'm ready to be.

553
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,286
I'll do whatever
it takes.

554
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,724
You love Fillory.

555
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,365
And you never stopped.

556
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,803
Julia stopped.

557
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,361
I mean, maybe in college,
but now I totally...

558
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,090
Yes, you see,
she stopped.

559
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,686
But you never did.

560
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,608
Only the best
and the purest

561
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,409
can face The Beast,

562
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,802
and that is you.

563
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,005
Right, okay,
so here's the thing,

564
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,560
I can't really touch the knife
that can kill The Beast.

565
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,971
Yes, you need
my strength.

566
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,761
I will infuse you
with my essence.

567
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,006
I have gifted you
my bestowal,

568
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,481
my largesse,
the seed of my power.

569
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,322
When you are ready
to face The Beast,

570
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,925
imbibe it.

571
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,806
JULIA: ls that semen?

572
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,161
Thank you.

573
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,568
Hmm. Thank you.

574
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,011
And you,
daughter of Earth.

575
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,801
Hmm.

576
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,766
Your mind
is encumbered.

577
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
A shroud.

578
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,161
No...
What?

579
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,401
Crudely made.

580
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,606
Ember, no,
it's okay...

581
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,886
I shall remove it.

582
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,961
JULIA: Remove what?

583
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,201
No, no, don't!

584
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,885
God. Jules!

585
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,601
You're welcome.
No need to thank me.

586
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,801
(GASPING)

587
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,041
Best of luck.

588
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,246
Oh, my God.

589
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,690
Jules...
Please. Please, don't.

590
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,529
Please don't touch me,
please don't...

591
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,647
Okay.)'-

592
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,691
Hey, Jules, come on. What happened?
Just tell me, please.

593
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,130
Can you take my memory?

594
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,611
Please, take my memory.

595
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,091
I don't know how.

596
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,286
Then we have to go.

597
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,606
<i>QUENTIN: I knew Julia wouldn't
tell me until she was ready,</i>

598
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,888
<i>but that might be never.</i>

599
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,081
(GASPS)

600
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,086
Here.

601
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,886
Thank you.

602
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,767
Any time.

603
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,086
Honestly, I was
getting pretty sick

604
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,009
of hearing your
voice in my head.

605
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,085
And I wanted to help you so badly.
I'm sorry I...

606
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,760
Don't be.
You found me.

607
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,969
Look, is there
some trick?

608
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,204
How do you take
people along?

609
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,965
Any of us can.

610
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,522
Well, I can barely
travel me.

611
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,846
They're a spell.

612
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,088
MARGO: Ugh. Literally?
QUENTIN: So, the dungeon?

613
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,288
Roaring success,
and a twofer.

614
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,961
Sorry?

615
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,642
We should see if
he's awake by now.

616
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,321
QUENTIN: on, my God.

617
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,688
That's Christopher
Plover.

618
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,921
What?

619
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,565
We were wrong
about everything.

620
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,925
Plover's not The Beast.

621
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,646
No.

622
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,846
Martin Chatwin is.

623
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,330
I loved Martin.

624
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,923
But there's something black
inside him I failed to see.

625
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,764
Look at the markings
on his face.

626
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,761
Age suspension magic,

627
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,561
so every day
he can start over.

628
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,326
Yeah, poor you.

629
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,640
ALICE: We need to find Martin.

630
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,843
Why? You can't stop him.

631
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,644
Tell us everything or

632
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,688
I'm going to feed
you to him.

633
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,761
(EXHALES)

634
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,362
When he was still a child,

635
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,529
<i>Fillory stopped taking him.</i>

636
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,807
<i>Once he found his way back, he
made it his mission to stay.</i>

637
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,726
<i>He'd heard about
the Wellspring,</i>

638
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,451
<i>the most ancient
location in Fillory.</i>

639
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,880
Which is what?

640
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,643
The source of all magic.

641
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,445
It's not only stronger than Ember
and Umber, it created them.

642
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,289
Fillory runs on it.

643
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,002
<i>Martin goes every
night to drink from it,</i>

644
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,526
<i>draining it a little
more each time.</i>

645
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,166
<i>The Wellspring's
magic is so strong,</i>

646
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,089
<i>it killed every
human thing in him.</i>

647
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,323
<i>There's only The Beast now.</i>

648
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,131
So, he goes to the Wellspring every
night, but it's not on any map.

649
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,888
(SIGHS) Guess I can
start asking around.

650
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,485
Or cast some kind
of locator maybe?

651
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,925
Or ask me.

652
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,171
He never could
hide his mind from me.

653
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,011
Our connection.

654
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,489
Okay, I vote we test
the knife out on him.

655
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,284
VICTORIA: Be careful.

656
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,964
Josh, come on.
We've got to go.

657
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,485
Come on!
JOSH: I have your cloak...

658
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,528
<i>QUENTIN: Yeah,
Josh and Victoria bailed.</i>

659
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,090
<i>On one hand, fuck them,</i>

660
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,322
<i>on the other hand,
you can't really blame them.</i>

661
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,443
<i>So, I was writing this down
because I didn't know much,</i>

662
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,848
<i>but I knew that I was
the hero of this story.</i>

663
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,766
<i>lt all just felt
like the exact moment</i>

664
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,320
<i>that my entire life
had been building up to,</i>

665
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,290
<i>all of the reading,
and dreaming,</i>

666
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,569
<i>and loneliness, and magic.</i>

667
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,641
<i>All of it.</i>

668
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,200
And then...

669
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,090
<i>Well, and then this
story actually happened.</i>

670
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,643
<i>And I started to
realize the truth.</i>

671
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,610
It's so insignificant.

672
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,289
Us being together
and falling apart,

673
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,124
I mean, it just
doesn't matter.

674
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,406
I made a mistake.

675
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,285
I know you don't want to
hear it, but I love you.

676
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,089
You're right,
I don't.

677
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,690
But I'm not going to go
in there angry at you.

678
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,961
Okay? I've got your back, Quentin.
We all do.

679
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,205
You know,
my entire life,

680
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,328
ever since the first time I
read Fillory and Further,

681
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,169
I've been waiting
for some

682
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,687
powerful being to
come down and say,

683
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,764
"Quentin Coldwater,
you are the one."

684
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,884
Every book, every movie,

685
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,483
it's about one special guy.

686
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,921
He's chosen.

687
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,402
In real life,
for every one guy,

688
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,403
there are a billion
people who aren't.

689
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,641
(LAUGHS)

690
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,565
Almost none of us
are the one.

691
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,966
Ember said...

692
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,283
Ember is a little
out of touch, I think.

693
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,288
You're a better Magician.

694
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,170
And you're a better person.

695
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,925
And I think that
if he'd met you,

696
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,241
he wouldn't be so
