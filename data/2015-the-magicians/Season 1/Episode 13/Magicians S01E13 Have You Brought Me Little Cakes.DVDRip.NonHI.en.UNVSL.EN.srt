1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,065
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,296
<i>"This was Fillory,</i>

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,333
<i>"a land of magic."</i>

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,206
<i>The Chatwins, they
mostly get chased around</i>

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,107
<i>by this time witch,
the Watcher Woman.</i>

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,473
<i>She plants clocks in trees.</i>

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,816
<i>This is where Fillory was born,</i>

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,281
where Plover told
tales to Jane and Martin.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,864
<i>I saw something in there.</i>

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,949
<i>The poor kid, he was just
trying to get a button to Fillory,</i>

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,220
<i>you know, so he could
escape this monster.</i>

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,524
<i>We live in a world that is
one world among many.</i>

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,225
<i>The Beast you saw
was from one such place.</i>

14
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,128
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,466
<i>Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.</i>

16
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,169
<i>Ember gave her the
ability to fuck with time,</i>

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,732
<i>and Jane used it to
create a time loop.</i>

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,143
<i>When she'd fail to stop The
Beast, she'd restart the loop.</i>

19
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,406
What's different this time?

20
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,878
I was at Brakebills?
You were supposed to be.

21
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:54,479
I can't sit here now and
think it was anything but fate.

22
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,214
<i>We summoned a goddess.</i>

23
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,053
<i>She touched all of us.
She granted every petition.</i>

24
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:02,786
There was one time we didn't
all die. When we went to Fillory.

25
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,455
I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.

26
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,944
<i>That girl you saw in the
dungeon? We'll get her out.</i>

27
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,459
<i>We need some
serious battle magic.</i>

28
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,199
<i>Spells only work if you
channel 100% clean.</i>

29
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,605
Bottling our
emotions, literally.

30
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,406
Shall we go fuck some shit up?

31
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,638
You slept with two other
people. We broke up.

32
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,444
<i>I was out of my mind.
I made a mistake.</i>

33
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,894
<i>My friends, I just... I can't let
them fight The Beast on their own.</i>

34
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,013
You want me to come
to Fillory with you?

35
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:29,948
Yeah.

36
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:33,525
<i>Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.</i>

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,000
Fillory and Further, Book Seven.

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,037
<i>I will think of a
great title later.</i>

39
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:08,058
<i>I knew it started as a blob of
crazy magic energy floating in space</i>

40
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,222
<i>that gave birth to the
gods, Ember and Umber,</i>

41
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:14,826
<i>that gave birth to this
amazing place, Fillory.</i>

42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,162
<i>And I even knew that
that place was real.</i>

43
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,037
<i>What I didn't know was one day,</i>

44
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,476
<i>I would actually go there and
seek out the gods themselves.</i>

45
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,506
Ember?

46
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,576
We need to talk to you.

47
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,615
Q. Come on. Put a
little conviction in it.

48
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,984
Ember!

49
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,818
Okay. Um, how did
Martin summon him?

50
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,194
I don't know. The
books are all poetry.

51
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,462
It's like Martin's
blood sang to the gods.

52
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,071
Hmm.

53
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,810
Q, what if it was literal?

54
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,678
That's worth a shot.

55
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,880
Damn it.

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,653
You okay?

57
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,663
No, I just stabbed my own hand.

58
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,262
Ah!

59
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,942
<i>We were expecting
something amazing,</i>

60
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,608
<i>and it was amazing.</i>

61
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,082
<i>Just more the shitty kind.</i>

62
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,914
Smells like an outhouse in here.

63
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,761
Jesus. Look at all this trash.

64
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,626
Someone's been
holed up here a while.

65
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:59,329
It is customary to
bow, children of Earth.

66
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,551
Have you brought
me little cakes?

67
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,349
<i>You're probably a
little confused, so,</i>

68
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,917
<i>now I'm going to do
that thing I kind of hate</i>

69
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,910
<i>where the book rewinds
to fill in all the blanks.</i>

70
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,302
<i>Sorry. Let's do it.</i>

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,613
Holy shit.

72
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,031
<i>Our route to Ember started</i>

73
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,286
<i>when we traveled
back in time to 1942</i>

74
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>to follow Jane Chatwin through a
vaguely TARDIS-looking portal to Fillory.</i>

75
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,624
Here she comes.

76
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,509
<i>We figured once we
were actually there,</i>

77
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,697
<i>we could get to the present
and back to my friends somehow,</i>

78
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,802
<i>uh, because that's Fillory.</i>

79
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,464
<i>There's always a way.</i>

80
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,275
<i>There's Jane, and there's us,</i>

81
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,835
<i>and someone mysterious
watching us, by the way,</i>

82
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,744
<i>to follow us through.</i>

83
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,743
<i>Standing in Fillory was the
greatest moment of my life,</i>

84
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,985
<i>and not just because, as I later
found out, the air is .02% opium,</i>

85
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,302
<i>which is a pretty unfair trick
to get you to love a place,</i>

86
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,921
<i>but whatever, we loved it.</i>

87
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,997
<i>Oh, uh, oh...</i>

88
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,162
<i>So, if you're a real fan, you'd
totally recognize this from the books.</i>

89
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,603
<i>This iconic scene, right?</i>

90
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,773
<i>Jane falls into a trap and is
saved by passing Magicians,</i>

91
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,276
<i>but what you didn't know,</i>

92
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,279
<i>is I am in that scene, bitches.</i>

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,080
Struggle, struggle.
Tighter, tighter.

94
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,546
Can't you see them yet?

95
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,914
Nope.

96
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,453
But they can't be
too hard to miss.

97
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,287
The witch and the fool. Iconic.

98
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,169
How are the witch and the fool

99
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,821
supposed to see her, I mean?

100
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,764
Oh!

101
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,228
Ooh, which one
do you think I am?

102
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,240
You don't look like any
witches or fools I've seen here.

103
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,644
Oh, wait. Don't. It's enchanted.

104
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,307
It'll only make it worse.

105
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,850
What's the point
of these, anyway?

106
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,215
They're everywhere.

107
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,514
Well, some animals can talk,

108
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,612
so, hunters have sort
of an ethical dilemma.

109
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,032
You know, you don't
want to eat something

110
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,285
as smart as you,

111
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,458
so, anything that
can answer the riddle

112
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,962
is set free.

113
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,590
So, uh, "What is no sooner

114
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,727
"broken than spoken?"

115
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,139
I have no idea.

116
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,036
Silence.

117
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,207
Silence.

118
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,641
How'd you know the answer?

119
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,886
I, uh, read it.

120
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,650
Brilliant. Thank you,
witch and fool. Ta-ta!

121
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,696
Okay. Go.

122
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,533
Geek out. We're in the
books. We are in the books.

123
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,732
<i>So, remember how someone
followed us into Fillory?</i>

124
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,933
Hey! Are you following us?

125
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,172
It's totally cool if you are.

126
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:28,247
Martin? He's not even
in this part of the book.

127
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,133
Still not sure I
quite understand

128
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,648
why you were
following my sister.

129
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,388
Well, why are you
following your sister?

130
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,888
Because Fillory
stopped taking you?

131
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,909
Martin, I know
you probably think

132
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,129
it's your fault, but it's not.

133
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,214
You want to be here because
you don't feel safe at home.

134
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,207
And we want to help.

135
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,304
What do you mean?

136
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,380
Christopher Plover is a
very powerful Magician now.

137
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,539
Maybe the most.

138
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,415
We think we can stop him
if we find something. Um...

139
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,048
It's a Fillorian knife
called the "Leo blade."

140
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,182
Have you heard of it?

141
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,951
No.

142
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,862
But I know someone
who might have.

143
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,836
Nope, never heard of it.

144
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,769
But it's something you're
more than capable of making,

145
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,834
given your reputation.

146
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,971
Though if you think
it may be too difficult.

147
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,840
What in Hades is
difficult about a blade?

148
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,139
Well, this one...

149
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,079
Has to kill a Master Magician.

150
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,045
And he's not even human anymore.

151
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,119
Six fingers, dark spells
you've never seen before.

152
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,349
Lad, fetch the moonstones.

153
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,988
Thing like that

154
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,050
can only be killed with
a blade of moonstones.

155
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,024
I have the only two in Fillory.

156
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,531
You couldn't even
make a needle with that.

157
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,869
These aren't just
rocks. They're alive.

158
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,908
I can mate them and breed more.

159
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,576
Then why haven't you?

160
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,214
Expensive. Takes time.

161
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,784
Care. Feeding. Years.

162
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,579
And it's not often
I'm called upon

163
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,818
to forge a Master
Magician murder weapon.

164
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,525
But you are from a
place that likes murder.

165
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,388
Earth.

166
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,393
Am I right? Yes,
we're from Earth.

167
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,466
Good. Then you know what I want.

168
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,525
We do and we agree.

169
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,306
So, what exactly did we
promise the knife-maker last night?

170
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,650
Well, he knew we
were from Earth.

171
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,955
And the rulers of Fillory
can only be from Earth.

172
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,011
So, he thinks we're...

173
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,845
Kings and queen. He
wants a seat at court.

174
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,583
But years, it'll take him years.

175
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,514
How?

176
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,692
Holy shit.

177
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,263
Oh, my God.

178
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,764
Jules, it's Ember's temple.

179
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,963
<i>It was as beautiful
as it was in the books,</i>

180
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>and standing there, you could
just feel that the gods were real.</i>

181
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,877
<i>But in Fillory, with
magic comes danger.</i>

182
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,916
She's coming. The Watcher Woman.

183
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,147
Martin. Wait. Martin!

184
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,559
Holy shit.

185
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,935
<i>In which we run into my favorite
random, scary villain from the books,</i>

186
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,373
<i>and she turns out to
be the exact opposite.</i>

187
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,076
Quentin?

188
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,644
You know the Watcher Woman?

189
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,515
Oh, my God. I do.

190
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,711
Of course, I should
have put that together.

191
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,910
This is my friend, Julia.

192
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,253
Julia, this is Jane Chatwin.

193
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,586
Um, all grown up.

194
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,657
You're not supposed
to be here yet.

195
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:02,991
Haven't even been born yet.

196
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,396
We know about the time
loops that you keep making.

197
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,694
As you should by now.

198
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,860
Right.

199
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,266
So, there have been 39 others...

200
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,363
And you're the volunteer tomato.

201
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,505
I'm sorry, what? In a
garden, you pull everything up.

202
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:22,072
Sometimes a stray vine just
keeps coming back. It volunteers.

203
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,843
That's really why you,
Quentin, you just keep coming.

204
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,048
Right. Okay.

205
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,950
So, okay. I'm the tomato.

206
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,290
And this is the last time.

207
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,023
Why is this the last one?

208
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,830
Oh.

209
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,063
Well, you die this time.

210
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:47,906
Huh.

211
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,912
I see. Do I die doing
something brave?

212
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,311
Very. Right, then.

213
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,777
If you survive, see to it that I
get a proper temple in my honor.

214
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,650
Granite statue, good
likeness, mind the chin.

215
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,556
I'll put that at
the top of my list.

216
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,024
Can I ask a question?

217
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,324
Why are you the Watcher
Woman? She's a villain.

218
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,419
Am I?

219
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,488
You scared the hell
out of everybody.

220
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,163
When I was a girl,
the Watcher Woman

221
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,727
inspired me to learn
magic to fight her.

222
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,741
Indeed, I grew up to be just a touch
stronger than that Watcher Woman.

223
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,367
That hurts my brain.

224
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,275
Apparently, it wasn't enough.

225
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,073
At least I learned some
fun things, like this.

226
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,219
Wait, what did you do?

227
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,688
Don't want her to hear us.

228
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,469
There's a patch on your
friend's memory, quite crude.

229
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,334
Made in haste,
likely by a Hedge.

230
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,872
Could you remove it?

231
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,875
No, it's there for a reason.

232
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,241
<i>Covering something
recent, something tragic.</i>

233
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,183
<i>Replacing it with something
beautiful, but false.</i>

234
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:23,036
My children, you have summoned
me to shed your burdens.

235
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,801
And so, they shall be.

236
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,976
Julia.

237
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,240
<i>I have a mission for you.</i>

238
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,087
If you still care about her...

239
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,155
Of course.

240
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,784
Protect her.

241
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,585
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you.

242
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,562
That was never
your job, Quentin.

243
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,425
Right, then.

244
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,529
Sorry, what were you
guys saying? So, Jane, um,

245
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,198
could you zoom us forward

246
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,139
to the present? Our present?

247
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,537
Goodbye, Quentin.

248
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,312
Godspeed.

249
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,413
Jesus.

250
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,549
<i>Welcome to Fillory 2016.</i>

251
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,886
It's a lot colder. It's like
being in a fog that never lifts.

252
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,724
Yeah.

253
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,533
Ow.

254
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,172
"Enchanted this to find
you if you ever arrive.

255
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,176
"Hope you're not dead.
Margo being such a bitch.

256
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,510
"Follow map to find us. El."

257
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,114
Come on.

258
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,851
<i>Welcome to the
Fillory of The Beast.</i>

259
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,786
<i>And this is what
happens to a world</i>

260
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,726
<i>ruled by the worst
kind of predator.</i>

261
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,123
<i>The kind of monster
who destroys childhood.</i>

262
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,069
Cheers, B.

263
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,636
<i>As soon as I saw them,
I remembered, oh, uh,</i>

264
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,705
<i>we kind of all slept
with each other</i>

265
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,614
<i>and hate each other right now.</i>

266
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,914
<i>And that is largely my fault.</i>

267
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,147
Really good to see you again, Q,

268
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,154
but why am I looking at the
hedge bitch who tried to kill you?

269
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,423
We worked it out. I wouldn't
be here without her, so...

270
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,860
I'm here. You don't
have to like me.

271
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,726
Oh, don't you worry.

272
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,830
We don't.

273
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,785
So, do you know where The
Beast is holding Victoria, or not?

274
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,177
I think the dungeon is in
the castle that isn't there.

275
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,077
That's the stupidest
name I've ever heard.

276
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,258
You didn't just do shots with

277
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,683
a bulldog named "Bristlycoat."

278
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,117
It's a kind of phosphoromancy.

279
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,384
Alice, you could
explain it, um, better.

280
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,589
How much further
to this knife maker?

281
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,491
These shoes weren't
cobbled for a quest.

282
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,057
Right over here, I think.

283
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,431
Not another one.

284
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,325
What?

285
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,494
They're everywhere.

286
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,472
Plus headstones,
unmarked graves.

287
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,166
Oh, no.

288
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,721
<i>We'd hoped that Martin
was still out there somewhere,</i>

289
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,045
<i>that we could save
him, but we took too long.</i>

290
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,815
<i>We failed him.</i>

291
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,476
All the Chatwins are dead.

292
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:27,910
Wow.

293
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,048
Your childhood fantasy is
a great big magical Dachau.

294
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,514
<i>The knife maker's house
was largely the same in 2016,</i>

295
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,555
<i>but now it was
run by a stranger.</i>

296
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,188
I remember you.

297
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,859
I must say, you've
aged well, the two of you.

298
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:08,927
Um...

299
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,721
I was eight.
Apprentice to my father.

300
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,057
Is he around?

301
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,862
He's out back. Six
feet under grass.

302
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,181
You know, he grew
a little aggravated

303
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,538
waiting for you
two to come back.

304
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,587
The Leo blade. As promised.

305
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,586
Payment is due.

306
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,055
As promised.

307
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,806
Here's the thing. All
the Chatwins are dead,

308
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,163
Fillory has no rulers, and
the only people from Earth

309
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,235
left here now not
locked in a dungeon...

310
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,565
Oh, my God.

311
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,797
I'm going to be royalty.

312
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,999
Yeah, we all are the next wave.

313
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,669
So, what he wants is to become
future royalty by marriage.

314
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,022
Wait, he wants to
marry one of us?

315
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,844
No, thank God.

316
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,112
He wants one of us to
marry her. His daughter.

317
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,215
Huh.

318
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,547
I mean, you know,
team player and stuff.

319
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,825
Hey, who says it's you, anyway?

320
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,383
It's not a volunteer gig,

321
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,292
and she doesn't get to pick.

322
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,731
This blade draws one
thing and one thing only.

323
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,234
The pure royal blood of
the High King of Fillory.

324
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,770
<i>I admit, I was 100% sure that
I was definitely the High King.</i>

325
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,179
Hmm.

326
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,845
<i>I know! Shocking, right?</i>

327
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,612
<i>You may be wondering
why they set it up</i>

328
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,312
<i>that aliens must rule Fillory,</i>

329
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,379
<i>and I'm sure there
is a great reason</i>

330
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,358
<i>and nobody has
any clue what that is.</i>

331
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,755
<i>Ember and Umber set it
up and they're not that into</i>

332
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,057
<i>explaining their big ideas</i>

333
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,894
<i>and you'd think it would be
centaurs or something, right?</i>

334
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,457
<i>I would do centaurs, but nope.</i>

335
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,671
So, what exactly
is supposed to...

336
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,871
Oh!

337
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,002
Get the fuck out.

338
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,741
Well, High King.

339
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,440
Makes certain
instinctual sense, I guess.

340
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,673
Your Majesty.

341
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,985
Oh, this'll make him
easier to live with.

342
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,557
So, there's a bump.

343
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,295
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

344
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,027
Apparently, marriage
here is different.

345
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,298
Really different.

346
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,908
Right, but as High King, I
can get a royal annulment.

347
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,773
No. Never.

348
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,275
Once you get married, you won't
be able to be with anyone else.

349
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,713
Literally. For the
rest of your life.

350
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,619
Here, but when
I go back, I can...

351
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,616
I can never leave Fillory.

352
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,455
Jesus.

353
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,264
El, you don't have to do this.

354
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,129
No, don't.

355
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,233
I'm doing this.

356
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,406
Eliot... Margo.

357
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,576
I am miserable.

358
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,947
My life, it doesn't work.

359
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,677
Nothing's ever fixed that.

360
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,449
Drugs, sex, food, booze.

361
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,285
Not even magic.

362
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,325
But maybe it all
led to this, to now.

363
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,552
For a reason that's actually

364
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,789
finally going to make my life

365
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,924
not just about me, and my
thoughts, and my feelings,

366
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,365
something... Bigger.

367
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,899
How wise you are,

368
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,699
Queen Margo the Destroyer.

369
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,448
Um...

370
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,389
Is it okay if I hate that
you're getting married?

371
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,288
Shit.

372
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,792
I think you're the only
person that I can stand.

373
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,330
You know what that means?

374
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,660
You have to be my best man.

375
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:17,743
<i>Be my husband
And I'll be your wife</i>

376
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,470
<i>Be my husband
And I'll be your wife</i>

377
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,309
This is taking forever.

378
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,076
<i>Be my husband</i>

379
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,915
Penny.

380
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,620
<i>Outside you there
is no place to go</i>

381
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,753
Eliot.

382
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,354
Fen. Nice to meet you.

383
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,827
Will you marry me?

384
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,360
<i>Ooh, Daddy now, now Love me good</i>

385
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,414
Okay, okay, where are you?

386
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,474
<i>Where is this?</i>

387
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,851
<i>Please don't treat
me so doggone mean</i>

388
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,530
<i>Please don't treat
me so doggone mean</i>

389
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,130
The blade is yours.

390
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,563
<i>You're the meanest
man I have ever seen</i>

391
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,061
Ha!

392
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,606
What? That's hot.

393
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,271
Here, maybe it's
just for high kings.

394
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,038
Oh! Jesus!

395
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,544
Okay, father-in-law,

396
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,548
why is this blade 1,000 degrees?

397
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:32,278
It may only be handled
by Master Magicians.

398
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,081
Are none of you masters?

399
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,877
Okay, I found the
castle. We can...

400
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,184
Oh! Cool.

401
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,256
Fuck!

402
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,560
I hate this place!

403
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,827
There has to be a trick, right?

404
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,804
We can't trick it into
thinking we're powerful.

405
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,864
The trick is, we have
to be that powerful.

406
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,533
I gather the crowd
you usually hang with

407
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,954
nods like you're smart when
you say incredibly obvious shit,

408
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,655
- but what we need is ideas.
- That's a good idea.

409
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,170
We need the power of a god.

410
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,682
Yeah, or gods.

411
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,910
Ember and Umber.

412
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,852
Who haven't been seen for
decades, so, good luck with that.

413
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,946
Okay, I have a
much less idiotic idea.

414
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,787
Why don't we use a Magician who's
actually been around The Beast?

415
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,019
The girl from his dungeon.

416
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,619
So much less idiotic,
it's almost good.

417
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,023
I'm with Penny.

418
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,360
Eliot?

419
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,369
Yeah, according
to the fine print

420
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,835
not actually written down,

421
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,396
I have a virgin farm
girl to impregnate.

422
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,599
Right this second?

423
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:29,733
This very one.

424
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,780
Best of luck, all.
You're welcome.

425
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,311
Mrs. Me?

426
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Mmm.

427
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,683
If I die while he's
balling himself limp,

428
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,920
I will haunt the
shit out of his ass.

429
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,986
You're fucking kidding me.

430
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,531
That's why they call it
the Castle That Isn't There.

431
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,029
Because it's invisible.

432
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,126
<i>The truth is, the
castle was constructed</i>

433
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,831
<i>to be invisible primarily
for budgetary reasons.</i>

434
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,067
<i>The royals had spent their
entire seasonal allowance</i>

435
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,736
<i>and then realized they
still had a castle to build,</i>

436
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,439
<i>so, they figured builder's
grade material is just fine</i>

437
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:08,708
<i>if you can't see it.</i>

438
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,849
You guys run,
I'll distract them.

439
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,181
Don't be stupid. They're men.

440
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,150
My sister! Please, help!

441
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,453
She just fainted. Can
one of you do something?

442
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,357
Hey, hey.

443
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,532
I need help.

444
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,864
You all right, miss?

445
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,598
Where am I?

446
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,552
Victoria.

447
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,882
Hey, we're here to get you out.

448
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,514
We're here to get you out. Okay?

449
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,252
The cuffs... I can't...

450
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,657
They keep you from traveling.

451
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,956
Yeah.

452
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,155
We'll get them.

453
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,357
Can you walk?

454
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,864
There's someone
else in the next cell.

455
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,532
<i>Ember?</i>

456
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,238
We need to talk to you.

457
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,105
<i>So, here we are at the temple,</i>

458
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,235
<i>hoping against
hope and all that.</i>

459
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,041
Ah!

460
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:25,216
It is customary to
bow, children of Earth.

461
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,004
Have you brought
me little cakes?

462
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,798
No.

463
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,967
Uh, we didn't really know
that we were supposed to.

464
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,042
Oh.

465
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,644
And I am so tired
of eating mice.

466
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,681
No matter.

467
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,353
And you are?

468
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,149
Uh, I'm Quentin Coldwater.

469
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,792
And Julia Wicker. Huh.

470
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:07,324
Spank my cheeks. You're
usually dead by now.

471
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:12,168
He kills you and I'm left
here to hide like an animal

472
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,106
in horrid, arid,
cake-deficient Loria,

473
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,971
but you're here.

474
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,080
What happened? What
are you doing here?

475
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,877
He lured me into
a trap, of course.

476
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:29,945
The Beast?

477
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,718
As you call him, yes.

478
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,891
He snared me and my
dear, departed Umber.

479
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,754
Wait, Umber's dead?

480
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,924
It's unseemly, all of it.

481
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,661
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:44,930
I don't mean to disrespect,

483
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,001
but how could a Magician
put the drop on you?

484
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:52,670
Fillory's magic belongs
to no one, not even a god.

485
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,679
A Magician with
enough determination

486
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,409
can harness its forces

487
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,385
and make haggis
of any one of us.

488
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,853
Hmm.

489
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,285
So, now I just
wait till he is slain.

490
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,689
I'm so fucking bored,
children of Earth.

491
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,588
Ha!

492
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,961
I've had sex with every
nymph in the kingdom.

493
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,728
Well, we're here to help.

494
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,634
But you're not a nymph.

495
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,563
No, I'm...

496
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,736
What the fuck is wrong with you?

497
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:26,937
Pray pardon?

498
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,012
What are you doing here?

499
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,290
You're just going
to let The Beast

500
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,782
trample the shit out of Fillory?

501
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,045
You think that I
want to be here?

502
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,882
I think you're being
kind of a whiny bitch.

503
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:35,977
Q, maybe don't insult...

504
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,046
No, does he care, or not?

505
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,985
You're right.

506
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,129
Years trying to outwit him.

507
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,993
Greatest failure, deepest shame.

508
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,231
And now he is prepared
for anything I do.

509
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,969
It's not I who can
defeat him, not directly.

510
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,708
I'll do it.

511
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,982
I volunteer. I'll
kill The Beast.

512
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,885
I love Fillory. I
don't know why.

513
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,287
But I am supposed to be here.

514
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,752
I'm supposed to fight for it.

515
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,556
Can you be the champion
we've been waiting for?

516
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,791
I want to be.

517
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,161
I'm ready to be.

518
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,667
I'll do whatever it takes.

519
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,073
You love Fillory.

520
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,743
And you never stopped.

521
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,143
Julia stopped.

522
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,710
I mean, maybe in
college, but now I totally...

523
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,444
Yes, you see, she stopped.

524
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,050
But you never did.

525
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,989
Only the best and the purest

526
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,789
can face The Beast,

527
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,194
and that is you.

528
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,363
Right, okay, so
here's the thing,

529
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,925
I can't really touch the
knife that can kill The Beast.

530
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,334
Yes, you need my strength.

531
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,101
I will infuse you
with my essence.

532
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,377
I have gifted you my bestowal,

533
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,846
my largesse, the
seed of my power.

534
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,709
When you are ready
to face The Beast,

535
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,275
imbibe it.

536
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,150
Is that semen?

537
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,521
Thank you.

538
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,922
Hmm. Thank you.

539
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,393
And you, daughter of Earth.

540
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,171
Hmm.

541
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,142
Your mind is encumbered.

542
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,271
A shroud.

543
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,505
No... What?

544
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,779
Crudely made.

545
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:42,974
Ember, no, it's okay...

546
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,243
I shall remove it.

547
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,340
Remove what?

548
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,578
No, no, don't!

549
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,243
God. Jules!

550
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,954
You're welcome.
No need to thank me.

551
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,419
Best of luck.

552
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,621
Oh, my God.

553
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,665
Jules... Please. Please, don't.

554
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,533
Please don't touch
me, please don't...

555
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,628
Okay.

556
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:10,665
Hey, Jules, come on. What
happened? Just tell me, please.

557
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,104
Can you take my memory?

558
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,612
Please, take my memory.

559
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,046
I don't know how.

560
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,283
Then we have to go.

561
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,617
<i>I knew Julia wouldn't tell
me until she was ready,</i>

562
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,853
<i>but that might be never.</i>

563
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,063
Here.

564
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,866
Thank you.

565
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:44,768
Any time.

566
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,156
Honestly, I was
getting pretty sick

567
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,046
of hearing your
voice in my head.

568
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:54,052
And I wanted to help
you so badly. I'm sorry I...

569
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,755
Don't be. You found me.

570
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,953
Look, is there some trick?

571
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,185
How do you take people along?

572
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,960
Any of us can.

573
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,524
Well, I can barely travel me.

574
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,834
They're a spell.

575
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,105
- Ugh. Literally?
- So, the dungeon?

576
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,273
Roaring success, and a twofer.

577
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:24,973
Sorry?

578
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,610
We should see if
he's awake by now.

579
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,324
Oh, my God.

580
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,701
That's Christopher Plover.

581
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,895
What?

582
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,560
We were wrong about everything.

583
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,903
Plover's not The Beast.

584
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,634
No.

585
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,812
Martin Chatwin is.

586
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,344
I loved Martin.

587
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:06,948
But there's something black
inside him I failed to see.

588
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,755
Look at the
markings on his face.

589
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,793
Age suspension magic,

590
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,561
so every day he can start over.

591
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,296
Yeah, poor you.

592
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,631
We need to find Martin.

593
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,866
Why? You can't stop him.

594
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,671
Tell us everything or

595
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,712
I'm going to feed you to him.

596
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,341
When he was still a child,

597
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,551
<i>Fillory stopped taking him.</i>

598
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,788
<i>Once he found his way back,
he made it his mission to stay.</i>

599
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,720
<i>He'd heard about the Wellspring,</i>

600
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,421
<i>the most ancient
location in Fillory.</i>

601
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,894
Which is what?

602
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,635
The source of all magic.

603
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:58,441
It's not only stronger than
Ember and Umber, it created them.

604
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,273
Fillory runs on it.

605
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,981
<i>Martin goes every
night to drink from it,</i>

606
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,519
<i>draining it a little
more each time.</i>

607
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,148
<i>The Wellspring's
magic is so strong,</i>

608
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:17,095
<i>it killed every
human thing in him.</i>

609
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,330
<i>There's only The Beast now.</i>

610
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,129
So, he goes to the Wellspring
every night, but it's not on any map.

611
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,894
Guess I can start asking around.

612
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,462
Or cast some kind
of locator maybe?

613
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,939
Or ask me.

614
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,172
He never could hide
his mind from me.

615
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,012
Our connection.

616
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,478
Okay, I vote we test
the knife out on him.

617
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,287
Be careful.

618
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,953
Josh, come on. We've got to go.

619
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,496
Come on! JOSH:
I have your cloak...

620
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,555
<i>Yeah, Josh and Victoria bailed.</i>

621
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>On one hand, fuck them,</i>

622
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,328
<i>on the other hand, you
can't really blame them.</i>

623
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,471
<i>So, I was writing this down
because I didn't know much,</i>

624
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,842
<i>but I knew that I was
the hero of this story.</i>

625
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,771
<i>It all just felt like
the exact moment</i>

626
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,317
<i>that my entire life had
been building up to,</i>

627
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,286
<i>all of the reading,
and dreaming,</i>

628
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,551
<i>and loneliness, and magic.</i>

629
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,651
<i>All of it.</i>

630
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,188
<i>And then...</i>

631
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,095
<i>Well, and then this
story actually happened.</i>

632
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:30,659
<i>And I started to
realize the truth.</i>

633
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,595
It's so insignificant.

634
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,263
Us being together
and falling apart,

635
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,097
I mean, it just doesn't matter.

636
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,397
I made a mistake.

637
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,305
I know you don't want
to hear it, but I love you.

638
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,072
You're right, I don't.

639
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,681
But I'm not going to
go in there angry at you.

640
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,949
Okay? I've got your
back, Quentin. We all do.

641
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,181
You know, my entire life,

642
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,404
ever since the first time I
read <i>Fillory and Further,</i>

643
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,158
I've been waiting for some

644
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,697
powerful being to
come down and say,

645
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,760
"Quentin Coldwater,
you are the one."

646
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,902
Every book, every movie,

647
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,478
it's about one special guy.

648
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,908
He's chosen.

649
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,419
In real life, for every one guy,

650
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,423
there are a billion
people who aren't.

651
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,584
Almost none of us are the one.

652
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,958
Ember said...

653
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:06,294
Ember is a little
out of touch, I think.

654
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,296
You're a better Magician.

655
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,165
And you're a better person.

656
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,943
And I think that
if he'd met you,

657
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,207
he wouldn't be so
sure that it's me.

658
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,875
But you're the one that they say

659
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,009
shows up every
single time, it's you.

660
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,986
I want to be the one. I do.

661
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,082
It's just,

662
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,557
it's the adult part of me,

663
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,753
the part of me that
understands how magic works,

664
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,763
it just keeps
screaming that it's you.

665
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,536
Every time that
Jane reset the loop,

666
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,003
she changed something.

667
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,436
So, what if I change something?

668
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,471
What if I give the blade to you?

669
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,119
You're not as good as I hoped,

670
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,284
Quentin Coldwater.

671
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,221
But you're better than you know.

672
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,066
Alice, you okay?

673
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:21,933
Come on, hon.

674
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,067
Pretend it's prom night and
you just want to shut him up.

675
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,151
Did you bogart the whole thing?

676
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:44,421
Alice?

677
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,873
Q, uh, can I...
Can I talk to you?

678
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,789
Jules, talk to me.

679
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,825
I did something.
Me and my friends.

680
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,361
We followed all the clues.

681
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,264
We thought that she
was leading us to her,

682
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,929
we summoned her.

683
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,431
You know, I actually believed

684
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,875
Our Lady Underground chose me.

685
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,955
Guys, stop. We should stop.

686
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,662
Julia. You dumb little witch.

687
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,169
You can't unring a bell.

688
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:04,834
Richard.

689
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,309
Move! Richard, move!

690
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,844
- Stop her!
- Do something.

691
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,077
Nothing's working.

692
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,278
Oh, God.

693
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,248
Richard.

694
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,550
Oh, God.

695
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,819
You'll find I've taken
away your magic,

696
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,759
so there's no point in trying.

697
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,864
My thanks for opening the door.

698
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,700
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

699
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,535
trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

700
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,443
the very stupid.

701
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,643
Richard...

702
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,720
No, no!

703
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,329
Kady!

704
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,190
Run, run.

705
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,536
Kady, that was my hermit
who healed your heart.

706
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,333
And now, I'm going to taste it.

707
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,468
Don't you fucking touch her!

708
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,168
When you address me...

709
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,011
avert your gaze.

710
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,082
I said, "Don't you
fucking touch her."

711
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,050
Fine. I'll take you first.

712
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,823
Kady, go!

713
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,958
I chose you, Julia.

714
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:34,830
From the first moment
you prayed, I felt your body.

715
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,663
I lifted it in my hands...

716
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,506
I can give you the greatest
pleasure of your life.

717
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,211
I can make you...

718
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,753
Ow!

719
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,634
<i>I need your help.
Something happened.</i>

720
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,253
Jesus.

721
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,956
Thank you for coming.

722
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,825
I got you. I got you.

723
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,960
The thing, where is it now?

724
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,767
Gone. It got what it wanted.

725
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,807
I didn't know who else to call.

726
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,568
You called the right person.

727
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,820
I'm going to help
you clean this up.

728
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,143
I'm going to need another favor.

729
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,138
And I know it'll cost
me, but I don't care.

730
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,782
Jesus, Julia, I want to help.

731
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,320
What Brakebills
did to your memory?

732
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,882
I need you to do it to me.

733
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,452
Please.

734
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,598
Jules. Uh...

735
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,737
Yeah, I know. What the
fuck were we thinking?

736
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,469
You were trying to do good,

737
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,370
and you got duped.

738
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,702
It's not your fault.

739
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,702
Jules, you saved Kady.

740
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,270
Yeah, but what
about everyone else?

741
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,314
You know, what...

742
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,617
Hey.

743
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,390
I'm going to help you.

744
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,730
I promise, whatever that means.

745
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,063
It means find him.

746
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,497
It means kill him.

747
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,000
And somehow I doubt that

748
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,067
that's easy, or even possible.

749
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,978
Well, impossible shit
is sort of our thing.

750
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,025
The Wellspring of all magic?

751
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,129
It's a truck stop shit-house.

752
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,466
He'll be here soon.

753
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:27,931
Let's go.

754
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,576
The fuck?

755
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,351
It's Plover's writing room.

756
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:17,819
All that power,

757
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,484
and he can't stop thinking
about where it happened.

758
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,254
Fillory needs meds
way more than magic.

759
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:27,498
Okay, so, where's
the actual Wellspring?

760
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,694
Poor Martin.

761
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,460
Okay, so...

762
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,571
Quentin.

763
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,444
Is it time for this already?

764
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,381
Hi, Martin.

765
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,417
We know it's you.

766
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:52,923
Mmm.

767
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:01,590
Well, you made it a good
long way this time around.

768
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,971
But this is it, Quentin.

769
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,518
I know you're still in there.

770
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,300
Look at this.

771
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,470
You still feel,
you're still hurt,

772
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,255
and you should be after
what happened to you.

773
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,340
The mediocre are
always so sentimental.

774
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,781
Although, must say,

775
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:26,719
most wouldn't walk to
certain death 40 times in a row.

776
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,792
You're no quitter.

777
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,430
Mmm.

778
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,227
Right.

779
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,161
Let's get this over with. Wait.

780
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,665
I have an offer.

781
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,467
Jane gave me a message for you.

782
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:45,974
A gift.

783
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,712
She said that you would want it,

784
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,544
that you would understand.

785
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:59,816
Your stupid bloody cards.

786
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:03,326
Your stalling tactics haven't
gotten any less pathetic.

787
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,860
Next time, put something
useful in your pocket.

788
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,891
Oh, that's right. No next time.

789
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,193
Shit!

790
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,736
You're stronger than you were.

791
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,340
Haven't learned to cast
while you're bleeding out?

792
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,516
For the love of
Christ, children...

793
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,086
Ah!

794
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,062
Quentin Coldwater.

795
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:51,903
Wait.

796
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,183
I need... I need your
help. Something happened.

797
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,090
Ah!

798
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,169
Something's still happening.

799
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,611
Stronger as well, I see.

800
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,044
So many surprises.

801
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:34,842
So,

802
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,848
what do you want?

803
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,450
Jules.

804
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,056
You killed Umber.
And you trapped Ember.

805
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,322
You know how to deal with gods.

806
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,934
You know how to
fuck up their shit.

807
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,334
Julia. No.

808
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,771
I want to make a deal.

809
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,404
Let's.

810
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,613
No.

811
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:19,988
God.
