1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:02,083
Previously on The Magicians.

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:05,141
This was Fillory.

3
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:07,267
A land of magic.

4
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:09,267
The Chatwins, they must
have got chased around,

5
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:10,835
like this Timewitch, the Watcherwoman.

6
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:13,230
She plants clocks in trees.

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,796
This is where Fillory was born.

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,402
Where Plover told tales to Jane and Martin.

9
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:20,683
I saw something in there.
That poor ***.

10
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,763
They were just trying to
get a button to Fillory.

11
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:25,039
Yeah, so he could escape this monster.

12
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,255
We live in a world that
is one world among many.

13
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,376
<i>The Beast you saw
was from one such place.</i>

14
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:33,128
What does Jane have to do
with the Beast?

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,631
<i>Still the same determined,
little Jane Chatwin.</i>

16
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:38,850
<i>Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time,</i>

17
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,353
<i>and Jane used it
to create a time loop.</i>

18
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,688
<i>When she'd fail to stop The Beast,</i>

19
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:45,690
<i>she'd restart the loop.</i>

20
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,359
What's different this time?

21
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:49,811
- I was at Brakebills?
- You were supposed to be.

22
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,196
I can't sit here now

23
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:53,365
and think it was anything but fate.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,317
<i>We summoned a goddess.</i>

25
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,069
<i>She touched all of us.
She granted every petition.</i>

26
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,488
There was one time
we didn't all die--

27
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,873
when we went to Fillory.

28
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,158
I'll go to Fillory

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,492
on one condition.

30
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:05,827
<i>The girl you saw in the dungeon?</i>

31
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,245
<i>We'll get her out.</i>

32
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:08,914
<i>We need some serious battle magic.</i>

33
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:11,216
<i>Spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.</i>

34
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,835
Bottling our emotions literally.

35
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,504
Shall we go fuck some shit up?

36
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:17,923
You slept with two other people.

37
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:20,392
<i>We broke up.
I was out of my mind.</i>

38
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:21,509
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

39
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,345
<i>My friends, I just--</i>

40
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,180
<i>I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own.</i>

41
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,515
You want me
to come to Fillory with you?

42
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:29,184
Yeah.

43
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:31,686
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

44
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:41,913
<i>"Fillory and Further.</i>

45
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,749
<i>Book Seven."</i>

46
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,538
<i>I will think of a great title later.</i>

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,511
_

48
00:01:57,382 --> 00:02:02,125
_

49
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:06,221
<i>I knew it started as a blob
of crazy magic energy</i>

50
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,722
<i>floating in space that gave birth</i>

51
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:09,391
<i>to the gods, Ember and Umber,</i>

52
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:14,729
<i>that gave birth
to this amazing place: Fillory.</i>

53
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,898
<i>And I even knew that
that place was real.</i>

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,951
<i>What I didn't know was one day,</i>

55
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:21,453
<i>I would actually go there</i>

56
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:23,905
<i>and seek out the gods themselves.</i>

57
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,408
Ember?

58
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,245
We need to talk to you.

59
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,415
Go on.
Put a little conviction in it.

60
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,634
Ember!

61
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:42,257
Okay.
Um, how did Martin summon him?

62
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,099
I don't know.
The books are all poetry.

63
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:48,313
It's like, "Martin's blood
sang to the gods."

64
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:53,485
Em.

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,103
Q.

66
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,656
What if it was literal?

67
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,108
That's worth a shot.

68
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,948
Damn it.

69
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,338
You okay?

70
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,623
No, I just stabbed my own hand.

71
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,847
Ah!

72
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,641
<i>We were expecting something amazing,</i>

73
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,360
<i>and it--it was amazing.</i>

74
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,979
<i>Just more the shitty kind.</i>

75
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,400
Smells like an outhouse in here.

76
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:48,456
Jeez, look at all this trash.

77
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,660
Someone's been holed up here a while.

78
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:56,164
It is customary to bow,

79
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,883
Children Of Earth.

80
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:15,066
Have you brought me little cakes?

81

87
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:46,548
Holy shit.

<i>Our route to Ember started</i>

89
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:50,051
<i>when we traveled back in time to 1942</i>

90
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,220
<i>to follow Jane Chatwin through</i>

91
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:55,140
<i>a vaguely TARDIS-looking portal
to Fillory.</i>

92
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,724
Here she comes!

93
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,610
<i>We figured
once we were actually there,</i>

94
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,780
<i>we could get to the present
and back to my friends somehow,</i>

95
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,898
<i>'cause that's Fillory.</i>

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,117
<i>There's always a way.</i>

97
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:08,236
<i>There's Jane, and there's us,</i>

98
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:11,823
<i>and someone mysterious
watching us, by the way,</i>

99
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,293
<i>to follow us through.</i>

100
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,663
<i>Standing in Fillory was
the greatest moment of my life,</i>

101
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:20,915
<i>and not just because,
as I later found out,</i>

102
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,801
<i>the air is .02% opium,</i>

103
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,086
<i>which is a pretty unfair trick
to get you to love a place,</i>

104
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,972
<i>but, whatever, we loved it.</i>

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,478
<i>Oh, uh, oh, so--
if you're a real fan,</i>

106
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,346
<i>you totally recognize this
from the books--</i>

107
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,182
<i>this iconic scene, right?</i>

108
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:40,185
<i>Jane falls into a trap and
is saved by passing Magicians,</i>

109
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:45,323
<i>but you didn't know is
I am in that scene, bitches.</i>

110
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:48,443
Struggle, struggle.
Tighter, tighter.

111
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,695
Okay, do you see them yet?

112
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:54,282
Nope, but they can't be
too hard to miss.

113
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,785
The Witch and The Fool.
Iconic.

114
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:01,005
How are The Witch and The Fool
supposed to see her--

115
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,045
Oh!

116
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:09,430
Ooh, which one do you think I am?

117
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:16,971
You don't look like any
witches or fools I've seen here.

118
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,306
Oh, wait.
Don't.

119
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,974
It's--it's enchanted.

120
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,309
It'll only make it worse.

121
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,894
What's the point of these anyway?

122
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:24,229
They're everywhere.

123
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,730
Well, some animals can talk,

124
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,649
so hunters have sort of
an ethical dilemma.

125
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,901
You know, you don't want to eat
something as smart as you,

126
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:34,572
so anything
that can answer the riddle

127
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,374
is set free.

128
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:41,713
So, uh, "What is no sooner
broken than spoken?"

129
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,383
I have no idea.

130
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:48,002
Silence.

131
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:53,091
Silence.

132
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,178
How'd you know the answer?

133
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,898
I, uh...read it.

134
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:04,068
Brilliant.
Thank you, Witch and Fool.

135
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,436
Ta-ta!

136
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:09,691
Okay...
go.

137
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,910
Geek out.
We're in the books.

138
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,278
We are in the books.

139
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,615
<i>So remember how someone
followed us into Fillory?</i>

140
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,201
Hey, are you following us?

141
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:23,204
It's totally cool if you are.

142
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,706
Martin?

143
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,708
He's not even
in this part of the book.

144
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:33,324
_

145
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,134
Still not sure I quite understand

146
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,052
why you were following my sister.

147
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:41,439
Well, why are you following
your sister?

148
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,559
'Cause Fillory stopped taking you?

149
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,977
Martin, I know you probably
think it's your fault,

150
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,563
but it's not.

151
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,732
You want to be here because
you don't feel safe at home.

152
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,785
And we want to help.

153
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,657
What do you mean?

154
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,459
Christopher Plover is
a very powerful Magician now.

155
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,077
Maybe the most.

156
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,829
We think we can stop him
if we find something.

157
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,915
Um, it's a Fillorian knife,

158
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,083
called the Leo Blade.

159
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,668
Have you heard of it?

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,722
No, but I know someone who might've.

161
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,263
Nope, never heard of it.

162
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,766
But it's something you're
more than capable of making,

163
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,101
given your reputation.

164
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,653
Though if you think it may be
too difficult--

165
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,772
What in Hades is difficult
about a blade?

166
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,941
- Well, this one...
- Has to kill a Master Magician.

167
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,027
And he's not even human anymore.

168
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,330
Six fingers, dark spells
you've never seen before.

169
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:42,116
Lad, fetch The Moonstones.

170
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:44,035
Thing like that

171
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:47,005
can only be killed
with a blade of Moonstones.

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,628
I have the only two in Fillory.

173
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,400
You couldn't even make
a needle with that.

174
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:59,017
These aren't just rocks.
They're alive.

175
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,470
I can mate them and breed more.

176
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,356
Then why haven't you?

177
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,643
Expensive.
Takes time.

178
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,646
Care, feeding.
Years.

179
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,398
And it's not often I'm called upon

180
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,901
to forge a Master Magician
murder weapon.

181
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:21,539
But you are from a place
that likes murder: Earth.

182
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,324
- Am I right?
- Yes, we're from Earth.

183
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,376
Good.
Then you know what I want.

184
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:28,212
We do, and we agree.

185
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:32,216
So what exactly did we promise
the knifemaker last night?

186
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,885
Well, he knew we were from Earth.

187
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,003
And the rulers of Fillory
can only be from Earth.

188
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,339
So he thinks we're...

189
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,342
Kings and Queen.
He wants a seat at court.

190
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:43,511
But years, it'll take him years.

191
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,063
How...

192
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,520
Holy shit.

193
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,443
Oh, my God.

194
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,745
Jules, it's Ember's Temple.

195
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,747
<i>It was as beautiful
as it was in the books,</i>

196
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:05,533
<i>and standing there,
you could just feel</i>

197
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,536
<i>that the gods were real.</i>

198
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:12,623
<i>But in Fillory,
with magic comes danger.</i>

199
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,759
She's coming!
The Watcherwoman!

200
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,712
Martin.
Wait.

201
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:19,547
Martin!

202
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,307
Holy shit.

203
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:35,761
_

204
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,951
<i>In which we run into my
favorite random, scary villain</i>

205
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:43,404
<i>from the books and she turns
out to be the exact opposite.</i>

206
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,989
Quentin?

207
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,625
You know The Watcherwoman?

208
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,494
Oh, my God.
I do.

209
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:52,079
Of course, I should have
put that together.

210
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:53,915
Uh, this is my friend, Julia.

211
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:58,469
Julia, this is Jane Chatwin
all grown up.

212
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,421
You're not supposed to be here yet.

213
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,640
Haven't even been born yet.

214
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,309
We know about time loops
that you keep making.

215
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,811
Well, as you should by now.

216
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,429
Right.

217
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,264
So there have been 39 others--

218
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:13,017
And you're the volunteer tomato.

219
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:14,435
I'm sorry, what?

220
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:16,437
In a garden, you pull everything up.

221
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,157
Sometimes a stray vine
just keeps coming back.

222
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,609
It volunteers.

223
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,196
That's really why you,
Quentin, you just keep coming.

224
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:27,498
Right.
Okay.

225
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:32,119
So, okay...I'm the tomato.

226
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,455
And this is the last time.

227
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,841
Why is this the last one?

228
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,342
Oh...

229
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:44,298
Uh, well you die this time.

230
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:47,685
Huh.

231
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,687
I see.

232
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,556
Do I die doing something brave?

233
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:54,192
- Very.
- Right, then.

234
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:57,395
If you survive, see to it that I
get a proper temple in my honor.

235
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:01,732
Granite statue, good likeness,
mind the chin.

236
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:03,367
I'll put that at the top of my list.

237
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,986
Can I ask a question?

238
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,822
Why are you the Watcherwoman
and she's a villain?

239
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,240
Am I?

240
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,492
I mean, you scared the hell
out of everybody.

241
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:14,412
Well, when I was a girl,
the Watcherwoman inspired me

242
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:16,497
to learn magic to fight her.

243
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,049
Indeed, I grew up to be

244
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,334
just a touch stronger
than that Watcherwoman.

245
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,887
That hurts my brain.

246
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,339
Apparently wasn't enough.

247
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,676
Least I learned some fun things,
like this.

248
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,733
Wait, what did you do?

249
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,356
Don't want her to hear us.

250
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:48,112
There's a patch on your
friend's memory, quite crude.

251
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:51,198
Made in haste, likely by a Hedge.

252
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,700
Could you remove it?

253
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:55,002
No, it's there for a reason.

254
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:03,544
<i>Covering something...recent,
something tragic...</i>

255
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:06,964
<i>Replacing it with something
beautiful but false.</i>

256
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:20,311
My children, you have summoned me

257
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:22,730
to shed your burdens

258
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,066
and so they shall be.

259
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,739
Julia.

260
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,410
<i>I have a mission for you.</i>

261
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:41,332
If you still care about her...

262
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,416
Of course.

263
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:45,419
Protect her.

264
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,588
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

265
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,342
That was never your job, Quentin.

266
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:52,510
Right, then.

267
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,865
Sorry, what were you guys saying?

268
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,434
So, Jane, um,
could you zoom us forward

269
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,436
to the present--our present?

270
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,608
Good-bye, Quentin.

271
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,077
Godspeed.

272
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:15,172
_

273
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,292
Jesus...

274
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:18,619
<i>Welcome to Fillory 2016.</i>

275
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,788
It's a lot colder.

276
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,290
It's like being in a fog
that never lifts.

277
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:26,210
Yeah.

278
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,797
Ow.
Jesus.

279
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:36,554
"Enchanted this to find you
if you ever arrive.

280
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,689
"Hope you're not dead.

281
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,891
"Margo being such a bitch.

282
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,395
Follow map to find us.
El."

283
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,231
Come on.

284
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:50,868
<i>Welcome to the Fillory of The Beast.</i>

285
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,653
<i>And this is what happens</i>

286
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,822
<i>to a world ruled by
the worst kind of predator--</i>

287
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:59,543
<i>the kind of monster
who destroys childhood.</i>

288
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,830
Cheers, B.

289
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,756
<i>As soon as I saw them, I remembered,</i>

290
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,759
<i>"Oh, we kind of
all slept with each other</i>

291
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,394
<i>"and hate each other right now.</i>

292
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:18,846
<i>And that is largely my fault."</i>

293
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,015
Really good to see you again, Q,

294
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,768
but, um, why am I looking
at the Hedgebitch

295
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,186
who tried to kill you?

296
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,687
We worked it out.

297
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,439
I wouldn't be here without her, so...

298
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,858
I'm here.
You don't have to like me.

299
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,194
Oh, don't you worry.

300
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,112
We don't.

301
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:41,619
So do you know where The Beast
is holding Victoria or not?

302
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:45,206
I think the dungeon is in
The Castle That Isn't There.

303
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,041
That's the stupidest name
I've ever heard.

304
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:50,377
You didn't just do shots with
a bulldog named Bristlycoat.

305
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,764
It's a kind of Phosphoromancy.
Alice, you could explain it...

306
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,467
um, better.

307
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,552
How much further to this knifemaker?

308
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:01,105
These shoes weren't cobbled
for a quest.

309
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,891
Right over here, I think.

310
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,976
Not another one.

311
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,061
What?

312
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,563
They're everywhere.

313
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:12,983
Plus headstones, unmarked graves.

314
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,953
Oh, no.

315
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,456
<i>We'd hoped that Martin
was still out there somewhere,</i>

316
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:22,460
<i>that we could save him,
but we took too long.</i>

317
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:23,744
<i>We failed him.</i>

318
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,080
All the Chatwins are dead.

319
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:30,167
Wow, your childhood fantasy
is a great big magical Dachau.

320
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:49,135
_

321
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,565
_

322
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:58,331
<i>The knifemaker's house
was largely the same in 2016,</i>

323
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,418
<i>but now it was run by a stranger.</i>

324
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,920
I remember you.

325
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,423
I must say, you've aged well,
the two of you.

326
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,008
Um...

327
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,094
I was eight.
Apprentice to my father.

328
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,846
Is he around?

329
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,014
He's out back.

330
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,516
Six feet under grass.

331
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:17,851
You know, he grew a little aggravated

332
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,686
waiting for you two to come back.

333
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,283
The Leo Blade, as promised.

334
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:39,122
Payment is due.

335
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,374
As promised.

336
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,543
Here's the thing:
all the Chatwins are dead,

337
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,762
Fillory has no rulers,
and the only people from Earth

338
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,298
left here now not locked
in a dungeon--

339
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,634
Oh, my God.
I'm going to be royalty.

340
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,887
Yeah, I mean,
we all are the next wave.

341
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,390
So what he wants is to become
future royalty by marriage.

342
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,809
Wait, he wants to marry one of us?

343
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,610
No, thank God.

344
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:04,731
He wants one of us
to marry her--his daughter.

345
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,950
Huh.

346
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,402
I mean, you know,
team player and stuff.

347
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,621
Hey, who says it's you anyway?

348
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,125
It's not a volunteer gig,
and she doesn't get to pick.

349
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,580
This blade draws one thing
and one thing only:

350
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,417
the pure royal blood
of the High King of Fillory.

351
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,755
<i>I admit, I was 100% sure that
I was definitely the High King.</i>

352
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,260
Hm.

353
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,762
<i>I know!
Shocking, right?</i>

354
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,480
<i>You may be wondering
why they set it up</i>

355
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,099
<i>that aliens must rule Fillory</i>

356
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:41,768
<i>and I'm sure there is a great reason</i>

357
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,105
<i>and nobody has any clue what that is.</i>

358
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,023
<i>Ember and Umber set it up</i>

359
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,825
<i>and they're not that into
explaining their big ideas</i>

360
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,443
<i>and, you know, you'd think</i>

361
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,661
<i>it would be centaurs
or something, right?</i>

362
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,281
<i>I would do centaurs, but nope.</i>

363
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:57,500
So what exactly is supposed to--

364
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,287
Oh!

365
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,122
Get the fuck out.

366
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,174
Well, High King.

367
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,544
Makes certain instinctual sense,
I guess.

368
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,179
Your Majesty.

369
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,215
Oh, this'll make him
easier to live with.

370
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,572
_

371
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,193
So there's a bump.

372
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:27,197
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

373
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,983
Apparently marriage here
is different.

374
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,151
Really different.

375
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,153
Right, but as High King,

376
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,654
I can get, like, a royal annulment.

377
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,490
No, never.

378
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:41,878
Once you get married, you won't
be able to be with anyone else

379
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,497
literally for the rest of your life.

380
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:47,050
Here, but when I go back, I can...

381
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,340
I can never leave Fillory.

382
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,593
Jesus.

383
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,178
El, you don't have to do this.

384
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
No, don't.

385
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,689
I'm doing this.

386
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,908
- Eliot--
- Margo.

387
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,277
I am miserable.

388
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,780
My life, it doesn't work.

389
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,531
Nothing's ever fixed that.

390
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,785
Drugs, sex, food, booze.

391
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,203
Not even magic.

392
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,373
But maybe it all led to this, to now,

393
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,542
for a reason that's actually
finally going to make my life

394
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:32,712
not just about me,
and my thoughts, and my feelings.

395
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,548
- Something--
- Bigger.

396
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,934
How wise you are,

397
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,721
Queen Margo The Destroyer.

398
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,562
Um...

399
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:57,320
Is it okay if I hate
that you're getting married?

400
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,239
Shit.

401
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,862
I think you're the only person
that I can stand.

402
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,743
You know what that means?

403
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,664
You have to be my Best Man.

404
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,916
God.

405
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:13,670
<i>♪ Be my husband ♪</i>

Fen.

414
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:36,276
Nice to meet you.

415
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,495

Okay, okay, where are you?

00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:58,298

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,643
That's hot.

427
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,277
Here, maybe it's just for High Kings.

428
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:24,447
Oh, Jesus!

429
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:27,901
Okay, Father-in-law,
why is this blade 1,000 degrees?

430
00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:30,654
It may only be handled by
Master Magicians.

431
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,572
Are none of you Masters?

432
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:34,324
Okay, I found the castle.
We can--

433
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:35,742
Oh, cool!

434
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,579
I hate this place!

435
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:43,536
_

436
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:47,936
There has to be a trick, right?

437
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,248
We can't trick it into
thinking we're powerful.

438
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,869
I mean, the trick
is we have to be that powerful.

439
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:53,688
I gather the crowd
you usually hang with

440
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:56,108
nods like you're smart when
you say incredibly obvious shit,

441
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,826
but what we need is ideas.

442
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:59,611
That's a good idea.
We need the power of a god.

443
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,997
Yeah, or gods.
Ember and Umber.

444
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,950
Who haven't been seen for
decades, so good luck with that.

445
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:07,202
Okay, I have a much less
idiotic idea.

446
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,670
Why don't we use a Magician

447
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:09,838
who's actually been around
The Beast--

448
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:11,339
the girl from his dungeon.

449
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,792
So much less idiotic
it's almost good.

450
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:16,128
I'm with Penny.

451
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,380
Eliot?

452
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:22,033
Yeah, according to the fine
print not actually written down,

453
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,469
I have a virgin farm girl
to impregnate.

454
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,037
Right this second?

455
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,606
This very one.

456
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:34,229
Best of luck, all.
You're welcome.

457
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:35,864
Mrs. Me?

458
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,821
If I die while
he's balling himself limp,

459
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,573
I will haunt the shit out of his ass.

460
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,410
You're fucking kidding me.

461
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,712
That's why they call it
The Castle That Isn't,

462
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:52,330
'cause it's invisible.

463
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:54,416
<i>The truth is,
the castle was constructed</i>

464
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:57,052
<i>to be invisible primarily
for budgetary reasons.</i>

465
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,337
<i>The royals had spent their
entire seasonal allowance</i>

466
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,890
<i>and then realized they still
had a castle to build,</i>

467
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:04,676
<i>so they figured builder's grade
material is just fine</i>

468
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:06,178
<i>if you can't see it.</i>

469
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,346
You guys run, I'll distract 'em.

470
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:12,184
Don't be stupid.
They're men.

471
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:14,569
My sister!
Please, help!

472
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:20,609
She just fainted.
Can one of you do something?

473
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,528
Hey, hey.

474
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,948
I need help.

475
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,750
You all right, miss?

476
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:31,086
Where am I?

477
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,382
Victoria.

478
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:46,301
Whoa--hey, hey.

479
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,720
Hey, we're here to get you out.
Okay, we're here to get you out.

480
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:50,772
The cuffs...
I can't--

481
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,057
They keep you from Travelling.

482
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:53,558
Yeah.

483
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,443
We'll get 'em.

484
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,778
Can you walk?

485
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:59,648
There's someone else
in the next cell.

486
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:02,567
<i>Ember?</i>

487
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,570
We need to talk to you.

488
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:07,239
<i>So here we are at the temple,</i>

489
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:10,625
<i>hoping against hope and all that.</i>

490
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:12,544
Ah!

491
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:15,582
_

492
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,335
It is customary to bow,

493
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:22,721
Children of Earth.

494
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,650
Have you brought me little cakes?

495
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:37,936
- No.
- Uh...

496
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,438
We didn't really know
that we were supposed to.

497
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,157
Oh.

498
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:45,994
And I am so tired of eating mice.

499
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:50,999
No matter.

500
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:55,036
And you are?

501
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:58,290
Uh, I'm Quentin Coldwater.

502
00:25:58,342 --> 00:25:59,708
And Julia Wicker.

503
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,209
Huh.

504
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:03,178
Spank my cheeks.

505
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,462
You're usually dead by now.

506
00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:06,798
He kills you

507
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,551
and I'm left here to hide
like an animal

508
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:13,805
in horrid, arid,
cake-deficient Loria,

509
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:16,641
but you're here.

510
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:19,978
What happened?

511
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,480
What are you--
what are you doing here?

512
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:25,650
He lured me into a trap, of course.

513
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,035
The Beast?

514
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,654
As you call him, yes.

515
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:33,875
He snared me
and my dead, departed Umber.

516
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,160
Wait, Umber's dead?

517
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:37,829
It's unseemly, all of it.

518
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:40,999
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,500
I don't mean to disrespect,

520
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:45,837
but how could a Magician
put the drop on you?

521
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,423
Fillory's magic belongs to no one,

522
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:50,342
not even a god.

523
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,927
A Magician with enough determination

524
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,233
can harness its forces and make
haggis of any one of us.

525
00:26:58,268 --> 00:26:59,567
Hm.

526
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:03,238
So now I just wait till he is slain.

527
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:06,574
I'm so fucking bored,
Children of Earth.

528
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,109
Ha!

529
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,445
I've had sex with every nymph
in the kingdom.

530
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:14,532
Well, we're here to help.

531
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,117
But you're not a nymph.

532
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,837
No, I'm--

533
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:22,874
What the fuck is wrong with you?

534
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:25,460
- Pray pardon?
- What are you doing here?

535
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:28,213
You're just gonna let The Beast
trample the shit out of Fillory?

536
00:27:28,265 --> 00:27:30,215
You think that I want to be here?

537
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:32,217
I think you're being
kind of a whiny bitch.

538
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,268
Q, maybe don't insult--

539
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,937
No, does he care or not?

540
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:37,555
You're right.

541
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,810
Years trying to outwit him.

542
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:45,480
Greatest failure, deepest shame.

543
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:49,317
And now he is prepared
for anything I do.

544
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:52,120
It's not I who can defeat him,

545
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:53,955
not directly.

546
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:02,080
I'll do it.

547
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,799
I volunteer.
I'll kill The Beast.

548
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:06,334
I love Fillory.
I don't know why.

549
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:09,921
But I am supposed to be here.

550
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,923
I'm supposed to fight for it.

551
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:15,927
Can you be the champion
we've been waiting for?

552
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:19,264
I want to be.

553
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:21,599
I'm ready to be.

554
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,151
I'll do whatever it takes.

555
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:27,439
You love Fillory.

556
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:29,657
And you never stopped.

557
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:31,359
Julia stopped.

558
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,945
I mean, maybe in college,
but now I totally--

559
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:37,665
Yes, you see, she stopped.

560
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,785
But you never did.

561
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:46,207
Only the best and the purest
can face The Beast,

562
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,295
and that is you.

563
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:51,963
Right, okay, so here's the thing,

564
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,299
I can't really touch the knife
that can kill The Beast.

565
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:55,717
Yes, you need my strength.

566
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,052
I will infuse you with...

567
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:01,139
my essence.

568
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:03,358
I have gifted you my Bestowal,

569
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:06,478
my Largesse, the seed of my power.

570
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,031
When you are ready to face The Beast,

571
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,317
imbibe it.

572
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,903
Is that semen?

573
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:20,875
Thank you.

574
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:23,878
Thank you.

575
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:26,214
And you, Daughter of Earth.

576
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,003
Hm.

577
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:35,507
Your mind is encumbered.

578
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:36,724
A shroud.

579
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,092
- No--
- What?

580
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,178
- Crudely made.
- Ember, no, it's okay--

581
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,514
- I shall remove it.
- Remove what?

582
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:43,898
No, no, don't!

583
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:46,184
Oh, God.
Jules!

584
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,269
You're welcome.
No need to thank me.

585
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,272
Best of luck.

586
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:56,935
_

587
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:59,056
- Jules--
- Please.

588
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,183
Please, don't--

589
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,226
please don't touch me,
please don't--

590
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:04,061
Hey, hey.
Jules, come on.

591
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:05,229
What happened?

592
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:07,398
Just tell me, please.

593
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,317
Can you take my memory?

594
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,068
Please, take my memory.

595
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
I don't know how.

596
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:21,061
I may have to go.

597
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:25,082
<i>I knew Julia wouldn't tell me
until she was ready,</i>

598
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,752
<i>but that might be never.</i>

599
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,059
Here.

600
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,408
Thank you.

601
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,325
Any time.

602
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:44,361
Honestly, I was getting pretty sick

603
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:45,862
of hearing your voice in my head.

604
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:48,582
I wanted to help you so badly.

605
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:50,200
I'm sorry I--

606
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:51,868
Don't be.

607
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,121
You found me.

608
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:56,707
Look, is there some trick?

609
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,459
How do you take people along?

610
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,378
Any of us can.

611
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,847
Well, I-I can barely
Travel me.

612
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,521
They're a spell.

613
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:15,942
Ew.
Literally?

614
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:17,227
So the dungeon?

615
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,780
Roaring success, and a twofer.

616
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:22,399
Sorry?

617
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:24,735
We should see if he's awake by now.

618
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,463
Oh, my God.

619
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:40,083
- That's Christopher Plover.
- What?

620
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:41,635
We were wrong about everything.

621
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,255
Plover's not The Beast.

622
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:48,308
No.

623
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:50,594
Martin Chatwin is.

624
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,602
I loved Martin.

625
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:02,989
But there's something black
inside him I failed to see.

626
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,275
Look at the markings on his face.

627
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:07,611
Age suspension magic,

628
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:12,115
so every day he can start over.

629
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:13,450
Yeah, poor you.

630
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:15,702
We need to find Martin.

631
00:32:15,754 --> 00:32:18,955
Why?
You can't stop him.

632
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:22,793
Tell us everything or
I'm going to feed you to him.

633
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:27,130
When he was still a child,

634
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:29,800
<i>Fillory stopped taking him.</i>

635
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:32,302
<i>Once he found his way back,</i>

636
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:36,022
<i>he made it his mission to stay.</i>

637
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:38,558
<i>He'd heard about The Wellspring,</i>

638
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,395
<i>the most ancient location in Fillory.</i>

639
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,898
Which is what?

640
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,568
The source of all magic.

641
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,823
It's not only stronger than
Ember and Umber,

642
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,574
it created them.

643
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:57,327
Fillory runs on it.

644
00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:01,081
<i>Martin goes every night
to drink from it,</i>

645
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:04,668
<i>draining it a little more each time.</i>

646
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,505
<i>The Wellspring's magic is so strong</i>

647
00:33:08,557 --> 00:33:10,841
<i>it killed...</i>

648
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:13,510
<i>every human thing in him.</i>

649
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:15,946
<i>There's only The Beast now.</i>

650
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:17,848
So he goes to the Wellspring
every night,

651
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,733
but it's not on any map.

652
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:22,018
Guess I can start asking around.

653
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,520
Or cast some kind of locator maybe?

654
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:26,273
Or ask me.

655
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:29,693
He never could hide his mind from me.

656
00:33:31,497 --> 00:33:33,363
Our connection.

657
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:36,867
Okay, I vote we test the knife
out on him.

658
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,878
We gotta be careful with this.
Shhhhh.

659
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,880
Josh come on we gotta go.

660
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:47,879
<i>Yeah, Josh and Victoria bailed.</i>

661
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:49,998
<i>On one hand, fuck 'em,
on the other hand,</i>

662
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,083
<i>you can't really blame 'em.</i>

663
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:56,171
<i>So I was writing this down</i>

664
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:57,839
<i>because I didn't know much,</i>

665
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:01,476
<i>but I knew that I was the hero
of this story.</i>

666
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:04,062
<i>It all just felt like
the exact moment</i>

667
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:06,598
<i>that my entire life
had been building up to,</i>

668
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:09,818
<i>all of the reading, and dreaming,</i>

669
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:13,538
<i>and loneliness, and magic.</i>

670
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:16,307
<i>All of it.</i>

671
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:17,942
<i>And then...</i>

672
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:20,578
<i>well, and then this story
actually happened.</i>

673
00:34:20,614 --> 00:34:25,116
<i>And I started to realize the truth.</i>

674
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:53,611
It's so insignificant--

675
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,313
us being together and falling apart,

676
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,232
I mean, it just doesn't matter.

677
00:34:57,317 --> 00:34:59,367
I made a mistake.

678
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:05,623
I know you don't want to
hear it, but I love you.

679
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:08,793
You're right, I don't.

680
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:13,748
But I'm not gonna go in there
angry at you.

681
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,216
Okay, I've got your back, Quentin.

682
00:35:15,302 --> 00:35:18,586
We all do.

683
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:22,557
You know, my entire life,

684
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,726
ever since the first time I read
"Fillory and Further,"

685
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:28,646
I've been waiting for some
powerful being

686
00:35:28,682 --> 00:35:31,766
to come down and say,
"Quentin Coldwater,

687
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:33,601
you are The One."

688
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:41,609
Every book, every movie,

689
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:44,913
it's about one special guy.

690
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:47,198
He's chosen.

691
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:50,361
In real life, for every one guy,

692
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,754
there are a billion people
who aren't.

693
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,874
Almost none of us are the one.

694
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,425
Ember said--

695
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:00,962
Ember is a little
out of touch, I think.

696
00:36:06,553 --> 00:36:09,621
You're a better Magician.

697
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,590
And you're a better person.

698
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,058
And I think that if he'd met you,

699
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:16,027
he wouldn't be so sure that it's me.

700
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:19,147
But you're the one that they say

701
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,232
shows up every single time, it's you.

702
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:24,068
I want to be the one.
I do.

703
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:26,404
It's just...

704
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:27,956
it's the adult part of me,

705
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,074
the part of me that understands
how magic works,

706
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,210
it just--it just keeps screaming

707
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:33,995
that it's you.

708
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,667
Every time that Jane reset the loop,

709
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,719
she changed something.

710
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:47,559
So what if I change something?

711
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:49,811
What if I give the blade to you?

712
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,240
You're not as good as I hoped,
Quentin Coldwater.

713
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:06,494
But you're better than you know.

714
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:16,120
- Alice, you okay?
- Come on, hon.

715
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:19,090
Pretend it's prom night and
you just want to shut him up.

716
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:37,358
Did you Bogart the whole thing?

717
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:38,776
Alice?

718
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:58,129
Q, uh, can I--
can I talk to you?

719
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,257
Jules.
Talk to me.

720
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:10,975
I did something.

721
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,811
Me and my friends.

722
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:16,814
We followed all the clues.

723
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,817
We thought
that She was leading us to Her.

724
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:22,987
We summoned Her.

725
00:38:23,023 --> 00:38:27,158
You know, I actually believed
Our Lady Underground chose me.

726
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,541
Guys, stop.
We should stop.

727
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:50,631
Julia.

728
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,383
Dumb little witch.

729
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,936
You can't unring a bell.

730
00:38:58,308 --> 00:38:59,390
Richard.

731
00:38:59,476 --> 00:39:00,558
Move!
Richard, move!

732
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,397
- Stop her!
- Do something.

733
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:08,123
- Can't use my magic.
- Nothing's working.

734
00:39:10,403 --> 00:39:11,903
Oh, God.

735
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:15,990
You'll find I've taken away
your magic,

736
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,126
so there's no point in trying.

737
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:24,415
My thanks for opening the door.

738
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:27,085
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

739
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,586
Trickster of the faithful,

740
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:31,139
the pure of heart,

741
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:33,224
the very stupid.

742
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:41,432
Richard...

743
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,154
No, no!

744
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:53,411
Kady...

745
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:55,663
Julia, run, run.

746
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:58,916
Kady, that was my hermit
who healed your heart.

747
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:02,420
And now, I'm going to taste it.

748
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:03,788
Don't you fucking touch her.

749
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:06,257
When you address me...

750
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,543
avert your gaze.

751
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:12,430
I said,
"Don't you fucking touch her."

752
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:14,799
Fine.
I'll take you first.

753
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:20,721
Kady, go.
Go!

754
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:24,642
I chose you, Julia.

755
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,978
From the first moment you prayed,

756
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:29,447
I felt your body.

757
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:31,866
I lifted it in my hands.

758
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:46,831
I can give you the greatest
pleasure of your life.

759
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,467
I can make you...

760
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:52,136
Ow!

761
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,320
I need your help.
Something happened.

762
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,702
Jesus.

763
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:28,256
Thank you for coming.

764
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,459
- Whoa--
- I got you. I got you.

765
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:37,765
The thing, where is it now?

766
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,353
Gone.
Got what it wanted.

767
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:44,689
I didn't know who else to call.

768
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:46,023
You called the right person.

769
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:47,191
I'm gonna help you clean this up.

770
00:41:47,227 --> 00:41:49,644
I'm gonna need another favor.

771
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:52,530
And I know it'll cost me,
but I don't care.

772
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:54,115
Jesus, Julia, I want to help.

773
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,986
What Brakebills did to your memory?

774
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:02,406
I need you to do it to me.

775
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:04,458
Please.

776
00:42:06,663 --> 00:42:08,796
Jules.

777
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,134
Yeah, I know.
What the fuck were we thinking?

778
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,719
You were trying to do good,

779
00:42:14,754 --> 00:42:16,721
and you got duped.

780
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:20,341
It's not your fault.

781
00:42:20,426 --> 00:42:21,676
Jules, you saved Kady.

782
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:23,978
Yeah, but what about everyone else?

783
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:26,681
You know, what...

784
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,572
Hey.

785
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,827
I'm going to help you.

786
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:42,947
I promise, whatever that means.

787
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:45,249
It means find him.

788
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:50,004
It means kill him.

789
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,872
And somehow I doubt that that's easy,

790
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:55,209
or even possible.

791
00:42:55,295 --> 00:42:58,546
Well, impossible shit
is sort of our thing.

792
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:17,698
The Wellspring of all magic?

793
00:43:17,784 --> 00:43:19,700
It's a truck stop shit-house.

794
00:43:19,786 --> 00:43:21,035
He'll be here soon.

795
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,870
Let's go.

796
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:07,563
The fuck?

797
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:09,148
It's Plover's writing room.

798
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,816
All that power,

799
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:13,069
and he can't stop thinking about
where it happened.

800
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:16,405
Fillory needs meds
way more than magic.

801
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:18,324
Okay, so.

802
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:21,077
Where's the actual Wellspring?

803
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:24,297
Poor Martin.

804
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:26,248
Okay, so...

805
00:44:32,924 --> 00:44:34,423
Quentin.

806
00:44:34,425 --> 00:44:37,560
Is it time for this already?

807
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:41,932
Hi, Martin.

808
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,600
We know it's you.

809
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:48,437
Mm.

810
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:54,493
Well, you made it a good
long way this time around.

811
00:44:57,582 --> 00:44:59,615
But this is it, Quentin.

812
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:01,667
I know you're still in there.

813
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:04,370
Look at this.

814
00:45:04,422 --> 00:45:06,038
You still feel, you're still hurt,

815
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,790
and you should be
after what happened to you.

816
00:45:07,842 --> 00:45:11,510
You mediocre are always
so sentimental.

817
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:14,130
Although, must say,

818
00:45:14,132 --> 00:45:16,849
most wouldn't walk to certain death

819
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,468
40 times in a row.

820
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,855
You're no quitter.

821
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,025
Mm.

822
00:45:27,729 --> 00:45:29,895
Right.

823
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:30,980
Let's get this over with.

824
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:32,732
Wait.

825
00:45:32,784 --> 00:45:34,483
I have an offer.

826
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:37,153
Jane gave me a message for you,

827
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:39,872
a--a gift.

828
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:41,407
She said that you would want it,

829
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:44,493
that--that you would
understand.

830
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:52,334
Your stupid bloody cards.

831
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:56,756
Your stalling tactics haven't
gotten any less pathetic.

832
00:45:56,808 --> 00:45:59,558
Next time, put something useful
in your pocket.

833
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:03,262
Oh, that's right.
No next time.

834
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:06,182
Shit!

835
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,686
You're stronger than you were.

836
00:46:10,738 --> 00:46:14,440
Haven't learned to cast
while you're bleeding out?

837
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:20,112
Oh, for the love of Christ,
children...

838
00:46:26,788 --> 00:46:27,753
Aah!

839
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:32,425
Now...

840
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:37,463
Quentin Coldwater.

841
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:44,804
Wait.

842
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,315
I need--

843
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:58,484
I need your help.
Something happened.

844
00:46:58,536 --> 00:46:59,902
Ow!

845
00:47:13,668 --> 00:47:16,919
Something's still happening.

846
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:24,093
Stronger as well, I see.

847
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:26,428
So many surprises.

848
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,764
So.

849
00:47:28,816 --> 00:47:31,433
What do you want?

850
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:34,987
Jules.

851
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,273
You killed Umber.

852
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:39,108
And you trapped Ember.

853
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,443
You know how to deal with gods.

854
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:43,612
You know how to fuck up their shit.

855
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:46,165
Julia.

856
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,502
- No.
- I want to make a deal.

857
00:47:49,537 --> 00:47:52,004
Let's.

858
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:10,988
