00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,970
<i>- Previously on</i>
<i>"the magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,973
<i>This was fillory,</i>
<i>a land of magic.</i>

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,042
<i>But the chatwins,</i>
<i>they mostly get chased around</i>

4
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,844
<i>By this time witch,</i>
<i>the watcherwoman.</i>

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,646
<i>She plants clocks in trees.</i>

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,882
<i>- This is where fillory</i>
<i>was born,</i>

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,184
Where plover told tales
to jane and martin.

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,553
<i>- I saw something in here.</i>
<i>Poor kid.</i>

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,489
<i>He was just trying</i>
<i>to get a button to fillory,</i>

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,958
<i>You know, so he could escape</i>
<i>this monster.</i>

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,361
<i>- We live in a world</i>
<i>that is one world among many.</i>

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,398
<i>The beast you saw</i>
<i>was from one such place.</i>

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,166
- What does jane have to do
with the beast?

14
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:37,669
<i>- Still the same determined,</i>
<i>little jane chatwin.</i>

15
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,872
<i>- Ember gave her the ability</i>
<i>to fu*Ã¡ with time,</i>

16
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,374
<i>And jane used it</i>
<i>to create a time loop.</i>

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,710
<i>When she'd fail</i>
<i>to stop the beast,</i>

18
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,712
<i>She'd restart the loop.</i>

19
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,380
- What's different this time?

20
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,816
- I was at brakebills?
- You were supposed to be.

21
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,217
- I can't sit here now

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,386
And think it was
anything but fate.

23
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,355
<i>We summoned a goddess.</i>

24
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:59,091
<i>She touched all of us.</i>
<i>She granted every petition.</i>

25
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,527
- There was one time
we didn't all die--

26
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,895
When we went to fillory.

27
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,163
- I'll go to fillory

28
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:05,531
On one condition.

29
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,832
<i>- The girl you saw</i>
<i>in the dungeon?</i>

30
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,267
<i>We'll get her out.</i>

31
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,935
<i>We need some serious</i>
<i>battle magic.</i>

32
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,237
<i>- Spells only work</i>
<i>if you channel 100% clean.</i>

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,873
- Bottling our emotions
literally.

34
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,543
Shall we go fu*Ã¡ some shit up?

35
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:18,944
- You slept with
two other people.

36
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,413
<i>We broke up.</i>
<i>- I was out of my mind.</i>

37
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,514
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

38
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,349
<i>My friends, I just--</i>

39
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,218
<i>I can't let them fight</i>
<i>the beast on their own.</i>

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,520
- You want me
to come to fillory with you?

41
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,222
- Yeah.

42
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,758
- Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

43
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,935
<i>- "fillory and further.</i>

44
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,804
<i>Book seven."</i>

45
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,610
<i>I will think</i>
<i>of a great title later.</i>

46
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,226
<i>I knew it started as a blob</i>
<i>of crazy magic energy</i>

47
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,727
<i>Floating in space</i>
<i>that gave birth</i>

48
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,429
<i>To the gods,</i>
<i>ember and umber,</i>

49
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:15,767
<i>That gave birth</i>
<i>to this amazing place: Fillory.</i>

50
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,936
<i>And I even knew that</i>
<i>that place was real.</i>

51
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,973
What I didn't know was one day,

52
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,474
<i>I would actually go there</i>

53
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,910
<i>And seek out</i>
<i>the gods themselves.</i>

54
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,412
Ember?

55
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,283
We need to talk to you.

56
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,453
- Go on.
Put a little conviction in it.

57
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,688
- Ember!

58
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,262
- Okay.
Um, how did martin summon him?

59
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,130
- [sighs] I don't know.
The books are all poetry.

60
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:49,334
It's like, "martin's blood
sang to the gods."

Q.

64
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,677
What if it was literal?

65
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,113

00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,699
Someone's been holed up here
a while.

A vaguely tardis-looking portal

Here she comes!

<i>We figured</i>

101
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,801
<i>We could get to the present</i>

Okay, do you see them yet?

00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,824
The witch and the fool.
Iconic.

122
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:02,060

123
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,066

So hunters have sort of
an ethical dilemma.

You know, you don't want to eat
something as smart as you,

Maybe the most.

165

352
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,063

Apprentice to my father.

00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,999
- He's out back.

355

356
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,803
You know, he grew
a little aggravated

357
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,671

Fillory has no rulers,

367

Left here now not locked

368

I'm going to be royalty.

- Well, high king.

396
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,513
Makes certain instinctual sense,
I guess.

397
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,148

401
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,166
- Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

402
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,968
- Apparently marriage here
is different.

403
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,103
Really different.

404
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,138
- Right, but as high king,

405
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,640
I can get, like,
a royal annulment.

406
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,476
- No, never.

407
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,847
Once you get married, you won't
be able to be with anyone else

408
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,449
Literally
for the rest of your life.

409
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,052

I can...

410
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,325
I can never leave fillory.

411

Nothing's ever fixed that.

421
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,325
But maybe it all led to this,
to now,

422
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,494
For a reason that's actually
finally going to make my life

588

I can't really touch the knife
that can kill the beast.
