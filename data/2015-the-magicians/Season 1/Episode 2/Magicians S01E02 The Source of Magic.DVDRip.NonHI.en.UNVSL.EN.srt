1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,579
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:05,004
<i>Quentin Coldwater for
the grad school interview?</i>

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,731
Well, he's dead.

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,401
I think he left
something for you.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,782
You may address me as Dean.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,877
Your only job is to pass
the examination before you.

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,945
Regrettably, you
failed the written exam.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,251
Do magic!

9
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,382
Stop it!

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,791
Ah...

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,780
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,498
I can do whatever I want to you.

13
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,364
Awesome.

14
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,635
You thought the school is
the only place to track the gift?

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,903
We've been watching
you for quite a while now.

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,171
What does that mean?

17
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,645
Okay, for some reason
you're involved, so be involved.

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,477
It says we need four people.

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,793
Look, I gather you guys need
some extra hands or something.

20
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,251
Let us know if
shit gets exciting.

21
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,826
Quentin Coldwater.

22
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,127
There you are.

23
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,624
Mr. Coldwater.

24
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,634
Quentin.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,194
Quentin?

26
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,375
Quentin!

27
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,070
Describe The Beast
that attacked you.

28
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,481
Uh...

29
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,545
How did it get in here?

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,264
Mr. Coldwater, what
did The Beast say to you?

31
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,633
How did it know your name?

32
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,108
So what is this place exactly,
besides a health hazard?

33
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,675
Time was, the finest
meat packing plant in town.

34
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,517
Yeah, it's a winner.

35
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,080
Hey, that star on
your arm... I earned it.

36
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,389
You will too, with effort,
whole sleeve of 'em.

37
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,101
So what does it mean?
Does it mean that...

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,223
You ask a lot of questions.

39
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,392
Yeah, I sure do.

40
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,168
Oh, my God, these are
real? Every one of them?

41
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,702
Guys, this is Julia.
Julia, my associates.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,839
Holy shit, it's...

43
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,780
And that is...

44
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,260
I'm sorry, what's
your name, sweetie?

45
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,253
I'm Marina. I'm new.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,949
Yeah, no kidding.
Everything up and running?

47
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,389
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,859
Julia, Marina. Grand tour.

49
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,397
Wait, so who were
those people exactly?

50
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,868
You seriously don't know?

51
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,064
What are you even doing here?

52
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,406
I don't know. I'm waiting for
something interesting to happen. You?

53
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,411
Magic is what I'm doing here.

54
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,845
They're hedge witches.
We're hedge witches.

55
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,507
Jesus, how are you even...

56
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,574
Girls, play nice.

57
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,481
So here is where we keep
all our ingredients and such.

58
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,023
Keeps them safe.

59
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,754
It's a... Meat locker,
or it was, anyway.

60
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,659
Now it is so well-stocked,

61
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,220
it's like the end
of the rainbow.

62
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,258
After you.

63
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,561
Hey!

64
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,830
Come on, open the door.

65
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,502
Hey!

66
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,343
Hey, don't be an asshole.

67
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,077
Open the door! Dude!

68
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,961
We were frozen.

69
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,966
Some kind of paralysis spell.

70
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,626
Took over the whole room.

71
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:08,144
Let's just nip
this all in the bud.

72
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,276
I already told you, the Dean
had something in his hand.

73
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,732
I don't know where
it went after that.

74
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,949
You can materialize objects?

75
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,591
I've been doing card
tricks half my life.

76
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,359
<i>I guess some of them
were disappearing.</i>

77
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,676
<i>Quentin...</i>

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,573
Take this.

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,284
Is he dead?

80
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,522
The Dean?

81
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,125
How did you know that spell?

82
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,192
Look, I know we're not supposed
to fire off battle magic, but...

83
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,464
I mean, come on.

84
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,543
Can we just get out
of this room soon?

85
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,672
Please?

86
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,952
<i>I know you want to
understand what happened.</i>

87
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,496
<i>Here's what I can say.</i>

88
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:33,898
We live in a world that is
one world among many.

89
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,960
<i>The Beast you saw
was from one such place.</i>

90
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,404
<i>We do not know the
exact nature of this entity,</i>

91
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,500
only that it was
powerful and malevolent.

92
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,307
Stop it!

93
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,370
<i>And we know that it is gone now.</i>

94
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,523
Wards and shields
protect Brakebills.

95
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,761
They are encoded to each authorized
person on campus and no one else.

96
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,296
We are investigating
how this Beast got through

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,271
and resetting everyone.

98
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,709
If someone is
responsible for this attack,

99
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,212
rest assured, they
will be expelled.

100
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,216
Classes are canceled tomorrow.

101
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,150
They will resume Wednesday.

102
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,609
There will be a quiz.

103
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,119
Alice.

104
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,388
Okay...

105
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,853
Um... Don't.

106
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,659
Hey, we did that spell.

107
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,427
You don't get to
say, "Don't," okay?

108
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,092
If they find out...

109
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,068
There they are.

110
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,731
Glad to see you, kid.
Oh, you poor thing.

111
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,706
Nurse? Are you okay?

112
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,176
No, it's okay, we're just
gonna get you a nice drink.

113
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,907
Jesus, you didn't tell
me you were dangerous.

114
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,286
Damn it.

115
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,787
And damn it.

116
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,421
Pretty sure my boyfriend's
starting to get curious where I am.

117
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,519
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's cold.

118
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,515
We're stuck, and they're
trying to kill us, so...

119
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,327
They're not trying
to kill us, okay?

120
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,891
These people are not
murderers. Trust me.

121
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,493
How do you know that?

122
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,061
Because, they don't
have the balls for it.

123
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,769
It's like some sort of
hazing ritual, a test.

124
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,107
I'm sick of flunking
tests right now.

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,112
I'm gonna figure it out.

126
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,563
Nothing to see, you
louche little degenerates.

127
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,192
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

128
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,497
Whatever, Eliot.

129
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,641
Welcome to the
Physical Kids' Cottage.

130
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,473
It's the single best
place on campus

131
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,344
for a number of reasons
that will become clear

132
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,348
as soon as you taste
our signature cocktail.

133
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,815
I've got to...

134
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,408
Try on this dress I have.

135
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,954
It's perfect. It's made
exactly for those assets

136
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,422
you're hiding underneath
that pilgrim tent.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,322
Yes, you must. Trust me.

138
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,553
<i>Apr√®s moi.</i>

139
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,192
On purpose?

140
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,565
Like, you guys
cast it, thinking,

141
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,729
"Oh, monster from another world.

142
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,466
"By all means, come on in."

143
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,869
So you messed up.

144
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,607
It's a little bit bigger
than messing up.

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,548
Than what? Than whatever
blew up the entire third year class?

146
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,847
There's a bad story every
few years around here.

147
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,181
I'm not sure that's avoidable.

148
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,149
Okay.

149
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,016
And if you confess...

150
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,684
Then I'm done. Yeah.

151
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,057
Argh...

152
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,129
Before I got here, I
was in the hospital.

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,897
I have... Or I had...

154
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,134
I don't know, uh, this thing that
I couldn't shake where I felt like

155
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,802
because nothing was ever not
gonna be pointless and empty, then,

156
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,709
uh, why go on?

157
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,945
And then I got here, and...

158
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,529
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

159
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,647
not knowing that
I was a Magician.

160
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,952
I can't go back.

161
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,120
So, okay.

162
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,833
There is a spell, uh, if they question
you, so they can't read your minds.

163
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,698
I'll write it down.

164
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,396
It's bulletproof.

165
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,563
Thank you.

166
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,477
Now, can you just help
me live with myself?

167
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,844
Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

168
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,112
deep and dark and personal now.

169
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,676
Ready? Good. I killed someone.

170
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,388
What?

171
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,550
I was 14. He was this...

172
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,553
He beat me up.

173
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,062
So I'm walking on the
street eating a candy bar,

174
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,364
'cause by then I already ate my
feelings at a professional level,

175
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,462
and I saw him crossing over.

176
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,040
And there was this bus coming.

177
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,046
I barely thought the thought.

178
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,514
Bam.

179
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,285
I knew immediately what
I'd done, that it was me.

180
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,344
My nose literally
started bleeding.

181
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:28,088
Logan Kinear died instantly and
I ruined my favorite button-down.

182
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,956
And that is the story of how I
discovered I was telekinetic.

183
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,912
If you're trying to tell
me that it gets better...

184
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,199
Oh, God, no. No, it doesn't.

185
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,469
I'm trying to tell you,
you are not alone here.

186
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,602
Funny little irony
they don't tell you,

187
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,613
magic doesn't come from talent.

188
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,041
It comes from pain.

189
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:58,724
So, do you know what it was,
the thing that attacked you?

190
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,386
No, I have no idea. Oh.

191
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,495
I thought you might be familiar

192
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,930
with some pretty crazy
shit since your family.

193
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,068
Yeah, no, my family's not...

194
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,935
Right. Yeah.

195
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,065
I get it.

196
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,637
Mine too.

197
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,043
Pointless and toxic.

198
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,283
I didn't really learn
magic formally as a kid.

199
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,347
I heard you never got invited to
take the Brakebills entrance exam.

200
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,359
How'd you even find
it? You walked right in.

201
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,588
It's not that hard.

202
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,636
We're in the Bermuda
Triangle of upstate New York.

203
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,570
How'd you get through though?

204
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,710
The wards around the
school are fingerprinted.

205
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,938
You're a stranger.

206
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,872
My parents have alumni keys.

207
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,781
Which are supposed to be charmed

208
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,478
with McNaughton's Unstealable.

209
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,077
I stole one.

210
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,188
Hmm.

211
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,292
Um...

212
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,919
I just wanted to go to school.

213
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,899
Why do you care?

214
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,335
Curious.

215
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,565
Just 'cause...

216
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,408
I don't know.

217
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,966
I want to be your
friend, I guess.

218
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,573
I don't feel like you do.

219
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,351
I'm sorry, I should
go. Thank you.

220
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,959
There has to be something here.

221
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,089
Maybe the phone numbers
are, like, a code or...

222
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,655
That's too easy.

223
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,463
Come on.

224
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,470
Chop-chop.

225
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,660
There has to be
something. I mean...

226
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,661
Oh!

227
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,479
Is it...

228
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,217
Dead? Mmm-hmm, yeah.

229
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,986
But it was already
dead, so I don't know.

230
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,550
Oh, my God.

231
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,596
Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us.

232
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,582
Why did I sign up
for this? This is...

233
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,065
Stop it, stop, okay? Okay, okay.

234
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,363
It's dead dead now, I think.

235
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,762
I don't know.

236
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,707
Calm down. Jesus, guys, it's me.

237
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,106
Pete, is that you?

238
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,644
Howdy.

239
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,546
Oh, Pete, that's definitely a
good look for you, an improvement.

240
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,913
Why don't you join us in
here? I think Marina misses you.

241
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,315
Just let us out.

242
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,445
Don't be stupid. You
have to find your way out.

243
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,989
So this is a test, another test.

244
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,752
Look, if you can't
get through this,

245
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,989
you definitely can't deal with
what it takes to do what we do.

246
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,394
Do you want magic or not, Julia?

247
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,228
Did you look everywhere?

248
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,329
Fast, frostbite's gonna set in.

249
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,762
Asshole. Shit.

250
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,000
What did that mean?

251
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,599
Uh, where didn't we look?

252
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,338
Wait.

253
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,890
<i>"Une chaleur temporaire."</i>

254
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,026
Temporary warmth.

255
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,707
I was just researching.

256
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,973
Reading a kids' book?

257
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,245
What do you want from me, huh?

258
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,916
Jesus, we could
not have screwed up

259
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,527
that spell worse, and
we can't take it back,

260
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,315
and you don't even like me.

261
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,479
I don't know you.

262
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,749
I don't know you either,

263
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:26,054
except that we summoned some kind
of killer mothman from another world.

264
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,491
Yeah, there is that.

265
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,109
You should hate me right
now. I dragged you into this.

266
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,844
It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand,

267
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,880
and it was the same one that
was on the book that I needed,

268
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,840
and my brother,
his spirit, I mean,

269
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,876
sent you to help me contact him.

270
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,140
So, I'm not really sure
that that's what happened.

271
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,444
The thing on my hand, the sigil,

272
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,916
uh, it appeared when I
was dreaming of Fillory.

273
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,848
Okay.

274
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,521
In my dream, the
sigil on my hand,

275
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,087
it came from Jane.

276
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,727
Chatwin. From Fillory.

277
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,327
Look, honestly,
Quentin, growing up,

278
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,930
the last thing I wanted
to do was read fantasy.

279
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,743
Okay. What if, um...

280
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,848
What if Fillory is real?

281
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,626
And I know that you think
that this is just about Charlie,

282
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,551
but I think maybe it's bigger,

283
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,111
because what came through
that mirror instead of Charlie,

284
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,851
it didn't exactly grow
up in the neighborhood.

285
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,458
Okay.

286
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:38,191
So what if it came
from, like, actual Fillory?

287
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,034
That's a leap, Quentin.

288
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,369
I mean, there are other worlds
out there, but Fillory is just fiction.

289
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,740
Oh, no, the uh,
Chatwins, they're real.

290
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,887
They lived next
door to the author.

291
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,311
He based the characters on them.

292
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,376
Jesus, how do you
not know any of this?

293
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,578
Is there, um, someplace on campus
we can to go to watch a video?

294
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,846
Yeah. Good.

295
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,391
<i>After living next door
to the Chatwins for years</i>

296
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,327
<i>and writing stories for
young Jane and Martin,</i>

297
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,222
<i>when Martin Chatwin disappeared,</i>

298
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,233
<i>Christopher Plover
was devastated.</i>

299
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,329
<i>This was just one of a series of painful
events that haunted Christopher Plover.</i>

300
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,670
<i>It suffused his work with a
sense of melancholy and loss.</i>

301
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,219
<i>And the mystery of Martin
Chatwin's disappearance</i>

302
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,144
<i>was never solved.</i>

303
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,886
<i>Even more mysterious,</i>

304
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,439
<i>Martin's sister Jane disappeared</i>

305
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,006
<i>the following year.</i>

306
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,243
That's a lot of disappearing.

307
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,530
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of why
people are obsessed with the books,

308
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,581
'cause you have these kids walking
into clocks, uh, into other worlds,

309
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,897
and they're based on real kids,

310
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,860
and the real kids, uh, vanished.

311
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,589
You're saying that
Charlie vanished too...

312
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,255
No, no, no, no,
no. I don't know.

313
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,908
I don't know what happened
to Charlie or anyone.

314
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,197
I don't, uh, know.

315
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,170
I mean look, we called
something from another world.

316
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,833
I don't know, can that
really be a coincidence?

317
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,432
So what do we do?

318
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,647
Don't get caught. I
can't get kicked out.

319
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,057
I mean, I have to find
out what happened to him.

320
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,051
Yeah, I know, but...

321
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,517
What if Fillory is real?

322
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,987
Jesus, you don't understand how
mind-blowing that is. It's just like...

323
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,616
Do you want to
stay at Brakebills?

324
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,684
Yes. Okay, so do I.

325
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,756
So let's just hide the evidence
and get our story straight.

326
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,892
Okay?

327
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,251
What, you're leaving?

328
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,192
I'm gone. Come on.

329
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,493
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

330
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,397
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

331
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,460
You want the truth? No sweat.

332
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,656
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

333
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,539
Couple lines, right mix of meds.

334
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,219
But you heard Quentin
and Alice in the lab.

335
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,404
No, I didn't.

336
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,180
There's this voice.

337
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,726
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

338
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,743
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

339
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,254
Says he's a Magician. That's...

340
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,091
That's all I know about him.

341
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,458
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

342
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,689
Holy shit.

343
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,063
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly non-stop fun growing up.

344
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,227
That's why I love that voice.

345
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,999
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

346
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,808
Yeah, right up until he
sent me to a lab to help,

347
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,040
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

348
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,741
You were hearing The
Beast? I was getting duped.

349
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:46,047
But, do they know? I
mean, Sunderland, anyone?

350
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,452
No, there's no point now.

351
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,718
But don't... Penny, don't go.

352
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,386
Come on. It's not your fault.

353
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,758
He tricked you.

354
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,089
Come on, don't be stupid.

355
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,258
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

356
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,077
that might actually be
able to help you with this?

357
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,262
Why do you care?

358
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,827
Look, I did the
spell too, Penny.

359
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,736
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

360
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,003
You're guilty.

361
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,954
Okay, great, let's
jump off a bridge.

362
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,037
Kady.

363
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,949
I can't stand it.

364
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,380
Okay.

365
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,285
Go.

366
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,989
But...

367
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,960
Hey, since you're out anyway,

368
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,571
come do something stupid
with me before you go.

369
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,769
Come on.

370
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,710
Yeah, 'cause crushed rocks,

371
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,118
you see that in spells that have
a concentrated area of effect.

372
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,132
I'm sorry, you knew this and
you didn't want to say anything?

373
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,596
Okay, well, I don't
know what I know.

374
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:03,186
Years reading Internet crap and
accidentally poisoning myself twice,

375
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,595
and now I'm stuck in a
freezer with some bitch.

376
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,758
Well, you are.

377
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,065
What, did you figure you wanted
magic at your blow dry last week?

378
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,730
This is serious for some of us.

379
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,365
Okay, you know what? I'm not
interested in your personal issues.

380
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,675
Hey.

381
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,339
There was sand
in that paint can.

382
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:26,078
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need a knife and a bowl.

383
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,018
Okay.

384
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,851
And...

385
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,791
<i>"Graisse de l'animal...
De pr√©f√©rence de mouton."</i>

386
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,919
Animal fat. Mutton.

387
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,327
Maybe there's meat?

388
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,530
Come on, let's go before
we freeze our tits off.

389
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,505
This isn't just some
lark to me, so you know.

390
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,567
No offense, okay, you just
smell a little Ivy League to me.

391
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,744
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

392
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,647
I was.

393
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,275
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

394
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,217
Well, it's like this secret
Yale, but for magic.

395
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,290
What?

396
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,935
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

397
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,427
Well, I can do magic.

398
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,087
Yeah, so can I.

399
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,488
And yet, somehow, I
flunked the entrance exam.

400
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,544
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

401
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,699
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

402
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,741
I mean, seriously, what
do they expect, you know?

403
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,936
Magic is real and that's the thing,
and once you know that, you can't...

404
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,444
Nothing else matters.

405
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,845
Exactly.

406
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,974
It's like...

407
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,186
I know it's there.

408
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:38,747
It's everywhere, all around me,

409
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:43,228
a whole world of
power and beauty.

410
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,726
You can't unsee it.

411
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,863
You wake up for the first time.

412
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,029
Yeah.

413
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,371
Who are we kidding?

414
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,969
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

415
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,554
No, no way, I cannot do that.

416
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,095
Mmm-mmm. No, please do that.

417
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,702
<i>I let my old life
tie me to the tracks</i>

418
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,501
<i>I heard my best friend tell me</i>

419
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,974
<i>You can never go back</i>

420
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,803
<i>I spent my long years</i>

421
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,973
<i>Learning to get out of the way</i>

422
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,455
<i>I have been taught
to turn the other cheek</i>

423
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,984
<i>I get my back stabbed,
buddy to the end of the week</i>

424
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:55,199
<i>I only try to make it
to the end of the day</i>

425
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,972
<i>I've seen it break
so many before</i>

426
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,912
<i>I don't wanna stick around
here and watch anymore</i>

427
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Mmm. Oh...

428
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,111
Yo, this one looks bunk.

429
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,347
Well, it's not. It's
Emerson's Alloy.

430
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,287
Uh, alloy's rusting.

431
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,451
How do you know?

432
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,788
'Cause I know things.

433
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,926
Like this place...
What? It's a gold mine.

434
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,662
Look, you can't
run away from you.

435
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,668
And, well, I'm here, and
I'm amazing, so I mean...

436
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,974
I'll take it under
advisement, okay?

437
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,603
Hey.

438
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,272
No, leave us alone.

439
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,180
Gladly, we've got
to discuss, um...

440
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:49,278
There you are, Quentin and
Alice, and Penny and Kady.

441
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,449
You're exactly who
I was looking for.

442
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,689
I found the most interesting
thing buried in our woods.

443
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,127
Follow me.

444
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,205
We never got near
the mirror, I swear.

445
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,747
We were studying, that's all.

446
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,806
What language even is this?

447
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,046
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

448
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,316
We all touched it.
I mean, I touched...

449
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:26,188
We were studying, so...

450
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,251
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

451
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,160
There's residue
all over this book,

452
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,529
including a summoning

453
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,591
we believe opened
the door to The Beast.

454
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,538
What did you say?

455
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,699
Nothing, I...

456
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,645
Don't look at me.

457
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,490
Look, I know
they're your friends.

458
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,156
Okay, at this point, I just have
to assume it was all of you.

459
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,197
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

460
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,291
Shut up and I'll
tell you, happily.

461
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,600
It's fine, let's go.

462
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,072
You're welcome, by the way.

463
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,242
What does that mean?

464
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,416
Quentin, can I see you, please?

465
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,888
Alice, you're free to go.

466
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,820
There's nothing I
can do in this moment

467
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,133
to stop the comet from
crashing into the earth, is there?

468
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,228
Hold on.

469
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:45,927
Uh...

470
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,063
What is this?

471
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,166
My books. I'm headed to return
them. You've heard, I assume.

472
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,006
Word travels fast
when your life's over.

473
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,272
Don't say that.

474
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,071
They're bringing
in a specialist.

475
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,509
Yeah, thanks. Ominous.

476
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,848
I'm sorry.

477
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,887
I don't know, I keep trying to
tell myself this is somehow better,

478
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,824
you know, not to know.

479
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,464
'Cause who would want
to know that magic exists

480
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,042
if there's nothing you
can do about it, you know,

481
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,830
if there's no one to
teach you or help you.

482
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,427
I don't know what to say.

483
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,099
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

484
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,699
You don't see color and want
to go back to black and white.

485
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:29,307
You do not have to
make me feel better really,

486
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,661
we basically just
met each other.

487
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:33,743
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

488
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,985
Look, don't go out
there and be the old you.

489
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,820
How, Eliot?

490
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,520
I go back there, and I'm...

491
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,185
I'm a depressed super nerd.

492
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,529
How about I find you, and
I don't say magic is real,

493
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,501
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

494
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,801
that life retains its
sparkle for decades.

495
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,641
Yeah, that sounds
nice. Thank you.

496
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,903
Okay.

497
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,309
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

498
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,180
I don't know.

499
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,084
I've heard of the specialist,
and all I can say is,

500
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,485
I hear they're very good.

501
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,868
<i>This is Julia, little
busy. Leave a message.</i>

502
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,330
Hey, it's Q.

503
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,568
<i>Look, I know when
we last met that, uh...</i>

504
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,539
<i>I'm sorry, Jules. I am.</i>

505
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:37,447
<i>I didn't know what it
must be like for you,</i>

506
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:42,352
<i>and I, um, I hope that
you are doing better.</i>

507
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,282
Oh, my God, you're
just going for it.

508
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,728
So, I got expelled, and they
are sending in a specialist

509
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:57,634
because the local brain wipe
guy is dead, and long story.

510
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,999
<i>Um...</i>

511
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,443
So if you remember or you
figured out why it didn't work on you,

512
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,102
I'd like to know
that, about now,

513
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,580
<i>because I need you to
remind me that magic is real.</i>

514
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,616
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

515
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,248
You know, without
Brakebills, it's just...

516
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,486
I'm lost and you're not.

517
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,754
Magic.

518
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,662
Okay.

519
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,724
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

520
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,547
You can't help
and I can't help you,

521
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,472
and it's just...

522
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,441
<i>To send your message, press one.</i>

523
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,569
<i>To erase, press two.</i>

524
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,710
<i>Deleted.</i>

525
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,382
Hey!

526
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:57,955
You little piece of shit.

527
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,798
You ratted me
out. I told the truth.

528
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,337
Not all of it. Oh, am I a fool?

529
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,895
Apparently not.

530
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,168
Get off! Yeah,
that's what I thought.

531
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,171
What the hell was
that, you maniac?

532
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,934
Hey! Step back, both of
you! Who shot off that spell?

533
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,839
He did! I did.

534
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,272
Infirmary, both of you, now.

535
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,756
Figured it out.

536
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:01,316
The spell, or, you know, the
whole point, that there isn't one.

537
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:05,660
Not to get out of the room, not
to keep the door locked, nada.

538
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,199
Cute, Pete.

539
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,497
Oh, and scissors make a
shitty screwdriver, by the way.

540
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,637
Good for you.

541
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,908
Now you get why
it was so important.

542
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,916
Uh, to almost die for no reason?

543
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,385
To figure out that not
everything gets solved by magic.

544
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,388
Key fact if you want
to last the month.

545
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,633
You're not still debating letting
me into your club, are you?

546
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,785
Hey, I invited you.

547
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,558
No, you attacked me in a bar,
in a bathroom, on my birthday.

548
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,428
I'm done trying to
prove myself to you.

549
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,797
You weren't.

550
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,497
You were trying to
prove yourself to me.

551
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,641
That means level 50.

552
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,613
Um...

553
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,648
Uh...

554
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,842
Wait, so you were...

555
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,717
Top bitch in New
York, for starters.

556
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,450
Um, and this was...

557
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,083
Me discovering
how much I like you.

558
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,926
You are smart. You're
passionate. You question things.

559
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,464
You messed with my head!

560
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,142
Think about how much you
learned about how to do that

561
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,067
for when you're level 50.

562
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,428
Hey, don't be mad. Don't be mad.

563
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,062
How am I supposed to trust you?

564
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,800
Why would you ever trust anyone?

565
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,867
I am willing to teach the
right people everything I know,

566
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,311
and I know a lot,

567
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,943
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

568
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,318
just like, for
instance, Brakebills.

569
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,788
Brakebills.

570
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,055
You want a drink?
Let's get a drink.

571
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,095
Might burn a little.

572
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,335
This is why you're not supposed
to throw this kind of magic around.

573
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,274
If you're lucky, I can fix this.

574
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,743
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

575
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,689
That's actually...

576
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,948
Hold still, please.

577
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,762
Pussy. Nobody asked you.

578
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,461
Me, the guy you
threw battle magic at?

579
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,231
Hey, have you heard of karma?

580
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,534
Well, sometimes it's instant.

581
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,404
You're welcome.

582
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,034
What is that? How did you...

583
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,772
Real Magicians
protect themselves.

584
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,005
Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

585
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,213
She's late.

586
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,551
She's coming.

587
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,650
Or she's just
done with your shit.

588
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,251
She doesn't have the option.

589
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,662
Finally.

590
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:02,099
Hey, look, that thing you wanted,
that charm or crystal or whatever?

591
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,971
The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?

592
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,408
Yeah, this guy I was
with, he grabbed it.

593
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,039
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

594
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,913
And more.

595
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,111
Here.

596
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,530
There's a ton of
good shit in there.

597
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,989
Listen to all that backpedaling.

598
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,025
I'll get it, okay?

599
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,550
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

600
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,257
Great. You're a
sweet girl, Kady.

601
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,061
You're a heartless bitch.

602
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:31,228
I'm generous with
you, considering.

603
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,867
Get me everything
on this list, this week.

604
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,411
Thanks so much.

605
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,946
You better get back to bed, hon.

606
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,493
I'm sure you got
class in the morning.

607
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,254
Hi. Oh...

608
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:29,158
Caught me where I'm not
meant to be, a terminal snooper.

609
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,994
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

610
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:37,195
You were there the day
of the alumni interview.

611
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,736
You were a paramedic.

612
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,361
Call me Eliza.

613
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,600
I was there that day to
make sure that you got here.

614
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,309
Oh...

615
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,336
Well, uh, thank you,

616
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,406
but I kind of screwed that up.

617
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,017
Uh...

618
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,911
They're calling in a specialist.

619
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,787
He's supposed to, um, wipe it
all away like it never happened.

620
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,517
Mmm. That sounds...

621
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,519
Hmm...

622
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:08,456
You know, I'm the
specialist? Sorry.

623
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,533
Shall we sit?

624
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,035
Okay. Okay.

625
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,269
Okay.

626
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,546
Um, just before, um, can I...

627
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,915
Um, why did you
give me that book?

628
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,049
<i>Fillory and Further,</i> book six.

629
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,920
I thought you'd appreciate it.

630
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,286
I lost it.

631
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,619
Guess I was wrong.

632
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,683
No, you're not, I...

633
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,524
I need to read it. I
just, I can't find it.

634
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,621
Things with Fillory
are funny that way.

635
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,535
Is Fillory real?

636
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,230
Why even ask if you'll
just forget it again?

637
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,636
The books, they're just...

638
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,408
They always felt
realer than anything.

639
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,578
Then it's real.

640
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,444
That's not a real answer.

641
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,641
Shall we begin?

642
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,179
Okay, do it.

643
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,382
Oh, Quentin, I am pleased!

644
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,255
What? Why?

645
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,820
You're a much better liar
than I expected you to be.

646
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,997
Can I level with you?

647
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,557
I wish you would.

648
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,467
You're not very remarkable.

649
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,966
You're smart, but no genius.

650
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,307
You do magic,
but nothing special.

651
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,804
And the worst is, you're
so eager to belong,

652
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,474
you even forget why you're here.

653
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,778
Why am I here?

654
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,351
You dreamed of it, didn't you?

655
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,123
Fillory, before the
attack, like a warning?

656
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,030
Yeah, how did you...

657
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,534
Because I've dreamed of it too.

658
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,139
And I've looked into
that Beast's eyes.

659
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,402
What?

660
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,042
Do you think you have a destiny?

661
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,979
Um, yes.

662
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,572
Yeah.

663
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,811
I used to believe that
crap too when I was young.

664
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:12,280
There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

665
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,220
I can't tell you why The
Beast came sniffing for you.

666
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,962
There's no reason
it should be you.

667
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,232
You can either step up
to it or not, it's up to you.

668
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,293
We'll just hope for the best.

669
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,564
Who are you?

670
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,940
Just another inadequate
Magician who's lost people.

671
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:36,412
So will you if you
don't get strong.

672
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,246
Learn fast, any means necessary.

673
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,496
Which is why I'm so pleased
to see you sitting there

674
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,785
like you don't have an
Emerson's in your pocket

675
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,848
to repel any spell
to wipe your mind.

676
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,325
Uh, you stole that.

677
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,691
Who stole it?

678
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,523
Relax, nobody's
taking your mind today.

679
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,864
We'll make something of you yet.

680
00:38:56,935 --> 00:39:00,201
I'll tell the school one
more chance, probation.

681
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,762
They'll respect my call.

682
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,940
Don't make me regret it.

683
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,879
Don't hop back on the garden
path like some little lemming,

684
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,247
or I'll erase everything
and start you over entirely,

685
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,717
for your own good.

686
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,117
The garden path?

687
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,623
Everything's connected.
Don't over-think it.

688
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,772
<i>All of Bobby's flowers
going to stand up straight</i>

689
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,608
<i>All of Bobby's flowers
going to stand up straight</i>

690
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,222
Congratulations, Julia. Big day.

691
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:54,817
First star. First of many.

692
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,225
Yeah.

693
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,691
<i>Bobby put the flowers
in his mama's car</i>

694
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,427
This is just the beginning.

695
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:12,933
<i>And he knew that they
wouldn't have to drive too far</i>

696
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,586
Hope your bits are covered.

697
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,722
Coming in.

698
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,274
How are you, Henry?

699
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,377
I'm sorry.

700
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,655
I knew he'd come, but I
swear I didn't know so soon.

701
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,090
No one is ready.

702
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,752
We need more time,

703
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,561
and a teacher with
full use of his hands.

704
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,793
There's that new wrinkle.

705
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,101
I'll find a way to help you.

706
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,832
We'll heal your
hands and your eyes.

707
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,399
It wouldn't help us. It
wouldn't help them, would it?

708
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:25,005
This is your problem,
that you should solve!

709
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,617
Quentin, Penny,
they're not built for this.

710
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,623
I know, and I've tried.

711
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,885
Go back there.

712
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,756
You say that like
I could hop a bus.

713
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,819
Find a way back.

714
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,558
Find The Beast. Kill him.

715
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,567
If I could manage that, we'd
be sharing a drink right now,

716
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,830
not a care in the world and
four good eyes between us.

717
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,008
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,066
Just tell me what else I can do.

719
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:57,779
All we can do is
make them Magicians.

720
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,383
That's not enough.

721
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,976
I know.

722
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,125
Gonna just keep this
BBQ poppin', my love.

723
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,601
Quentin!

724
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,041
Get over here. Quentin.

725
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,171
Come on! Come on!

726
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,183
Join the party,
sad sack. Hurry up.

727
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,812
Oh, my God, it's not
like we have all day.

728
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,152
We're so drunk.
Okay, we have all day.
