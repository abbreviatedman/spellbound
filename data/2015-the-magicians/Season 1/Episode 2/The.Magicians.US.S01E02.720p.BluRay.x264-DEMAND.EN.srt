00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,488
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

354
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,369
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

355
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,444
You want the truth? No sweat.

356
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,522
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

357
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,487
Couple lines,
right mix of meds.

358
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,164
But you heard Quentin
and Alice in the lab.

359
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,401
No, I didn't.

360
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,165
There's this voice.

361
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,651
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

362
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,724
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

363
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,250
Says he's a Magician.
That's...

364
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,043
That's all I know about him.

365
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,408
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

366
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,686
Holy shit.

367
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,003
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly non-stop fun growing up.

368
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,162
That's why I love that voice.

369
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,961
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

370
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,761
Yeah, right up until
he sent me to a lab to help,

371
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,003
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

372
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,686
You were hearing The Beast?
I was getting duped.

373
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,003
But, do they know?
I mean, Sunderland, anyone?

374
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,408
No, there's no point now.

375
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,687
But don't... Penny, don't go.

376
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,366
Come on. It's not your fault.

377
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,726
He tricked you.

378
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,041
Come on, don't be stupid.

379
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,202
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

380
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,805
that might actually
be able to help you with this?

381
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,206
Why do you care?

382
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,806
Look, I did
the spell too, Penny.

383
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,724
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

384
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,961
You're guilty.

385
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay, great,
let's jump off a bridge.

386
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,007
Kady.

387
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,926
I can't stand it.

388
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,367
Okay.

389
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,281
Go.

390
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,006
But...

391
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,971
Hey, since you're out anyway,

392
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,527
come do something stupid
with me before you go.

393
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,766
Come on.

394
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,681
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

395
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,688
Yeah, 'cause crushed rocks,

396
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,082
you see that in spells that have
a concentrated area of effect.

397
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,049
I'm sorry, you knew this and you
didn't want to say anything?

398
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,565
Okay, well,
I don't know what I know.

399
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,123
Years reading Internet crap and
accidentally poisoning myself twice,

400
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,561
and now I'm stuck
in a freezer with some bitch.

401
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,721
Well, you are.

402
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,043
What, did you figure you wanted
magic at your blow dry last week?

403
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,690
This is serious
for some of us.

404
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,366
Okay, you know what? I'm not
interested in your personal issues.

405
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,681
(SHIVERING)

406
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,603
Hey.

407
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,286
There was sand
in that paint can.

408
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,048
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need a knife and a bowl.

409
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,963
Okay.

410
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,804
And...

411
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,771
<i>"Graisse de I'animal...
De pr√©f√©rence de mouton."</i>

412
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,888
Animal fat. Mutton.

413
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,291
Maybe there's meat?

414
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,521
Come on, let's go before
we freeze our tits off.

415
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,721
(BLOWING)

416
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,484
This isn't just some
lark to me, so you know.

417
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,564
No offense, okay, you just smell
a little Ivy League to me.

418
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,723
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

419
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,609
I was.

420
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,250
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

421
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,169
(EXHALES) Well, it's like this
secret Yale, but for magic.

422
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,241
What?

423
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,845
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

424
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,365
Well, I can do magic.

425
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,090
Yeah, so can l.

426
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
And yet, somehow,
I flunked the entrance exam.

427
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,449
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

428
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,690
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

429
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,683
I mean, seriously,
what do they expect, you know?

430
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,889
Magic is real and that's the thing,
and once you know that, you can't...

431
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,450
Nothing else matters.

432
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,803
Exactly.

433
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,927
It's like...

434
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,161
I know it's there.

435
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,687
It's everywhere,
all around me,

436
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,209
a whole world
of power and beauty.

437
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,010
(CHUCKLES)

438
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,686
You can't unsee it.

439
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,851
You wake up for
the first time.

440
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,001
Yeah.

441
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,327
(SCOFFS)
Who are we kidding?

442
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,971
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

443
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,525
No, no way, I cannot do that.

444
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Mmm-mmm.
No, please do that.

445
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,481
(SOBS)

446
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,651
<i>I let my old life
tie me to the tracks</i>

447
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,451

448
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,966
<i>You can never go back</i>

449
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,764
<i>I spent my long years</i>

453

around here and watch anymore</i>

456
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,041
Mmm.
Oh...

457
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,521
(CHUCKLES)

458
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,088
Yo, this one looks bunk.

459
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,288
Well, it's not.
It's Emerson's Alloy.

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,249
Uh, alloy's rusting.

461
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,406
How do you know?

462
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
'Cause I know things.

463
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,888
Like this place...
What? It's a gold mine.

464
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,645
Look, you can't
run away from you.

465
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,645
And, well, I'm here,
and I'm amazing, so I mean...

(CHUCKLES)

467
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,925
I'll take it under
advisement, okay?

468
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,570
<i>HEY-</i>

469
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,244
No, leave us alone.

470
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,163
Gladly, we've got
to discuss, um...

471
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,246
There you are, Quentin and
Alice, and Penny and Kady.

472
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,402
You're exactly who
I was looking for.

473
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,684
I found the most interesting
thing buried in our woods.

474
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,081
Follow me.

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,162
We never got near
the mirror, I swear.

476
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,681
We were studying, that's all.

477
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,762
What language even is this?

478
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,050
Yes, I mean,
sure, I touched it.

479
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,282
(STAMMERING) We all touched it.
I mean, I touched...

480
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,170
We were studying, so...

481
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,210
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

482
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,123
There's residue
all over this book,

483
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,487
including a summoning

484
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,562
we believe opened
the door to The Beast.

485
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,483
What did you say?

486
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,681
Nothing, I...

487
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,281
(SIGHS)

488
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,646
Don't look at me.

489
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
Look, I know
they're your friends.

490
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,561
(SCOFFS)

491
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,123
Okay, at this point, I just have
to assume it was all of you.

492
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,168
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

493
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,289
Shut up and I'll
tell you, happily.

494
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,561
It's fine, let's go.

495
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,046
You're welcome, by the way.

496
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,206
What does that mean?

497
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,403
Quentin, can I
see you, please?

498
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,845
Alice, you're free to go.

499
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,764
There's nothing I
can do in this moment

500
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,047
to stop the comet from crashing
into the earth, is there?

501
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,201
Hold On. (CLEARS THROAT)

502
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,887
Uh...

503
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,047
What is this?

504
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,124
My books. I'm headed to return them.
You've heard, I assume.

505
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,964
Word travels fast
when your life's over.

506
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,246
Don't say that.

507
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,045
They're bringing
in a specialist.

508
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,442
Yeah, thanks. Ominous.

509
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,851
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,850
I don't know, I keep trying to tell
myself this is somehow better,

511
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,809
you know, not to know.

512
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,444
'Cause who would want
to know that magic exists

513
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,965
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

514
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,804
if there's no one
to teach you or help you.

515
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,406
I don't know what to say.

516
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,051
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

517
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,686
You don't see color and want
to go back to black and white.

(SIGHS)

519
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,281
You do not have to make
me feel better really,

520
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
we basically
just met each other.

521
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,729
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

522
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,963
Look, don't go out
there and be the old you.

523
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,804
How, Eliot?

524
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,484
I go back there, and I'm...

You dreamed of it, didn't you?

702
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,082
Fillory, before the attack,
like a warning?

703
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,964
Yeah, how did you...

704
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,530
Because I've
dreamed of it too.

705
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,126

into that Beast's eyes.

have a destiny?

Um, yes.

Yeah.

crap too when I was young.

There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

I can't tell you why The Beast
came sniffing for you.

it should be you.

taking your mind today.

something of you yet.

one more chance, probation.
