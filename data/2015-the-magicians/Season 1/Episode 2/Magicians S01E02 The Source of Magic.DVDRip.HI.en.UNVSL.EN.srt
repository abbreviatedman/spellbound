00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,397
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

355
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,460
You want the truth? No sweat.

356
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,656
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

357
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,539
Couple lines, right mix of meds.

358
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,219
But you heard Quentin
and Alice in the lab.

359
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,404
No, I didn't.

360
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,180
There's this voice.

361
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,726
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

362
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,743
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

363
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,254
Says he's a Magician. That's...

364
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,091
That's all I know about him.

365
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,458
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

366
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,689
Holy shit.

367
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,063
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly non-stop fun growing up.

368
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,227
That's why I love that voice.

369
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,999
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

370
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,808
Yeah, right up until he
sent me to a lab to help,

371
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,040
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

372
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,741
You were hearing The
Beast? I was getting duped.

373
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:46,047
But, do they know? I
mean, Sunderland, anyone?

374
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,452
No, there's no point now.

375
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,718
But don't... Penny, don't go.

376
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,386
Come on. It's not your fault.

377
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,758
He tricked you.

378
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,089
Come on, don't be stupid.

379
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,258
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

380
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,077
that might actually be
able to help you with this?

381
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,262
Why do you care?

382
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,827
Look, I did the
spell too, Penny.

383
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,736
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

384
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,003
You're guilty.

385
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,954
Okay, great, let's
jump off a bridge.

386
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,037
Kady.

387
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,949
I can't stand it.

388
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,380
Okay.

389
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,285
Go.

390
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,989
But...

391
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,960
Hey, since you're out anyway,

392
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,571
come do something stupid
with me before you go.

393
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,769
Come on.

394
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,679
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

395
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,710
Yeah, 'cause crushed rocks,

396
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,118
you see that in spells that have
a concentrated area of effect.

397
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,132
I'm sorry, you knew this and
you didn't want to say anything?

398
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,596
Okay, well, I don't
know what I know.

399
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:03,186
Years reading Internet crap and
accidentally poisoning myself twice,

400
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,595
and now I'm stuck in a
freezer with some bitch.

401
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,758
Well, you are.

402
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,065
What, did you figure you wanted
magic at your blow dry last week?

403
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,730
This is serious for some of us.

404
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,365
Okay, you know what? I'm not
interested in your personal issues.

405
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,736
(SHIVERING)

406
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,675
Hey.

407
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,339
There was sand
in that paint can.

408
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:26,078
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need a knife and a bowl.

409
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,018
Okay.

410
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,851
And...

411
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,791
<i>"Graisse de l'animal...
De préférence de mouton."</i>

412
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,919
Animal fat. Mutton.

413
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,327
Maybe there's meat?

414
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,530
Come on, let's go before
we freeze our tits off.

415
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,768
(BLOWING)

416
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,505
This isn't just some
lark to me, so you know.

417
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,567
No offense, okay, you just
smell a little Ivy League to me.

418
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,744
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

419
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,647
I was.

420
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,275
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

421
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,217
(EXHALES) Well, it's like
this secret Yale, but for magic.

422
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,290
What?

423
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,935
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

424
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,427
Well, I can do magic.

425
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,087
Yeah, so can I.

426
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,488
And yet, somehow, I
flunked the entrance exam.

427
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,544
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

428
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,699
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

429
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,741
I mean, seriously, what
do they expect, you know?

430
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,936
Magic is real and that's the thing,
and once you know that, you can't...

431
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,444
Nothing else matters.

432
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,845
Exactly.

433
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,974
It's like...

434
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,186
I know it's there.

435
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:38,747
It's everywhere, all around me,

436
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:43,228
a whole world of
power and beauty.

437
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,020
(CHUCKLES)

438
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,726
You can't unsee it.

439
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,863
You wake up for the first time.

440
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,029
Yeah.

441
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,371
(SCOFFS) Who are we kidding?

442
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,969
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

443
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,554
No, no way, I cannot do that.

444
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,095
Mmm-mmm. No, please do that.

445
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,530
(SOBS)

446
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,702
<i>I let my old life
tie me to the tracks</i>

00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,974
<i>You can never go back</i>

449
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,803
<i>I spent my long years</i>

<i>Learning to get out of the way</i>

<i>I have been taught

<i>I get my back stabbed,

453

here and watch anymore</i>

456
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Mmm. Oh...

00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,548
(CHUCKLES)

458
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,111
Yo, this one looks bunk.

459
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,347
Well, it's not. It's
Emerson's Alloy.

460
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,287
Uh, alloy's rusting.

461
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,451
How do you know?

462
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,788
'Cause I know things.

463
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,926
Like this place...
What? It's a gold mine.

464
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,662
Look, you can't
run away from you.

465
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,668
And, well, I'm here, and
I'm amazing, so I mean...

(CHUCKLES)

467
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,974
I'll take it under
advisement, okay?

468
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,603
Hey.

469
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,272
No, leave us alone.

470
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,180
Gladly, we've got
to discuss, um...

471
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:49,278
There you are, Quentin and
Alice, and Penny and Kady.

472
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,449
You're exactly who
I was looking for.

473
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,689
I found the most interesting
thing buried in our woods.

474
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,127
Follow me.

475
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,205
We never got near
the mirror, I swear.

476
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,747
We were studying, that's all.

477
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,806
What language even is this?

478
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,046
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

479
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,316
(STAMMERING) We all
touched it. I mean, I touched...

480
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:26,188
We were studying, so...

481
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,251
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

482
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,160
There's residue
all over this book,

483
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,529
including a summoning

484
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,591
we believe opened
the door to The Beast.

485
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,538
What did you say?

486
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,699
Nothing, I...

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,645
Don't look at me.

Look, I know
they're your friends.

(SCOFFS)

491
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,156
Okay, at this point, I just have
to assume it was all of you.

492
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,197
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

493
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,291
Shut up and I'll
tell you, happily.

494
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,600
It's fine, let's go.

495
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,072
You're welcome, by the way.

496
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,242
What does that mean?

497
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,416
Quentin, can I see you, please?

498
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,888
Alice, you're free to go.

499
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,820
There's nothing I
can do in this moment

500
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,133
to stop the comet from
crashing into the earth, is there?

501
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,228
Hold on. (CLEARS THROAT)

502
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:45,927
Uh...

503
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,063
What is this?

504
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,166
My books. I'm headed to return
them. You've heard, I assume.

505
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,006
Word travels fast
when your life's over.

506
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,272
Don't say that.

507
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,071
They're bringing
in a specialist.

508
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,509
Yeah, thanks. Ominous.

509
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,848
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,887
I don't know, I keep trying to
tell myself this is somehow better,

511
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,824
you know, not to know.

512
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,464
'Cause who would want
to know that magic exists

513
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,042
if there's nothing you
can do about it, you know,

514
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,830
if there's no one to
teach you or help you.

515
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,427
I don't know what to say.

516
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,099
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

517
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,699
You don't see color and want
to go back to black and white.

You do not have to
make me feel better really,

520
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,661
we basically just
met each other.

521
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:33,743
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

522
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,985
Look, don't go out
there and be the old you.

523
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,820
How, Eliot?

524
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,520
I go back there, and I'm...

525
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,185
I'm a depressed super nerd.

526
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,529
How about I find you, and

There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

I can't tell you why The
Beast came sniffing for you.

it should be you.
