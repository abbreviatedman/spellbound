00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,525
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,001
<i>Quentin Coldwater
for the grad school interview?</i>

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,726
Well, he's dead.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,450
I think he left
something for you.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,763
You may address me as Dean.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,845
Your only job is to pass
the examination before you.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,922
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,246
Do magic!

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,401
Stop it!

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,761
Ah...

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,609
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,483
I can do whatever I want to you.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,366
Awesome.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,649
You thought the school is the
only place to track the gift?

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,882
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,166
What does that mean?

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,641
Okay, for some reason you're
involved, so be involved.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,484
It says we need four people.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,722
Look, I gather you guys need
some extra hands or something.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,290
Let us know
if shit gets exciting.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,808
Quentin Coldwater.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,163
There you are.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,641
Mr. Coldwater.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,641
Quentin.

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,207
Quentin?

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,361
Quentin!

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,082
Describe The Beast
that attacked you.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,481
Uh...

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,564
How did it get in here?

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,289
Mr. Coldwater,
what did The Beast say to you?

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,643
How did it know your name?

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,121
So what is this place exactly,
besides a health hazard?

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,682
Time was, the finest meat
packing plant in town.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,491
Yeah, it's a winner.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,080
- Hey, that star on your arm...
- I earned it.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,369
You will too, with effort,
whole sleeve of 'em.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,050
So what does it mean?
Does it mean that...

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,202
You ask a lot of questions.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,408
Yeah, I sure do.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,161
Oh, my God, these are real?
Every one of them?

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,687
Guys, this is Julia.
Julia, my associates.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,807
Holy shit, it's...

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,769
And that is...

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,205
I'm sorry,
what's your name, sweetie?

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,248
I'm Marina. I'm new.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,971
Yeah, no kidding.
Everything up and running?

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,371
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,887
Julia, Marina. Grand tour.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,367
Wait, so who were
those people exactly?

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,845
You seriously don't know?

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,048
What are you even doing here?

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,409
I don't know. I'm waiting for
something interesting to happen. You?

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,403
Magic is what I'm doing here.

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,847
They're hedge witches.
We're hedge witches.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,524
Jesus, how are you even...

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,602
Girls, play nice.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,486
So here is where we keep
all our ingredients and such.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,050
Keeps them safe.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,727
- It's a...
- Meat locker, or it was, anyway.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,643
Now it is so well-stocked,

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,245
it's like the end
of the rainbow.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,286
After you.

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,601
Hey!

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,845
Come on, open the door.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,525
Hey!

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,329
Hey, don't be an asshole.

67
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,091
Open the door! Dude!

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,929
We were frozen.

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,964
Some kind of paralysis spell.

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,644
Took over the whole room.

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,126
Let's just nip
this all in the bud.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,283
I already told you, the Dean
had something in his hand.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,685
I don't know where
it went after that.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,962
You can materialize objects?

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,603
I've been doing card
tricks half my life.

76
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,369
<i>I guess some of them
were disappearing.</i>

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
<font color="#0E7521">Ripped & Corrected By mstoll</font>

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,691
<i>Quentin...</i>

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,561
Take this.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,281
Is he dead?

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,571
The Dean?

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,121
How did you know that spell?

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,170
Look, I know we're not supposed
to fire off battle magic, but...

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,486
I mean, come on.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,523
Can we just get out
of this room soon?

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,681
Please?

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,971
<i>I know you want
to understand what happened.</i>

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,485
<i>Here's what I can say.</i>

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,849
We live in a world
that is one world among many.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,924
<i>The Beast you saw was
from one such place.</i>

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,321
<i>We do not know the exact
nature of this entity,</i>

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,490
only that it was
powerful and malevolent.

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,289
Stop it!

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,362
<i>And we know that it is gone now.</i>

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,483
Wards and shields
protect Brakebills.

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,770
They are encoded to each authorized
person on campus and no one else.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,251
We are investigating
how this Beast got through

98
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,243
and resetting everyone.

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,690
If someone is responsible
for this attack,

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,162
rest assured,
they will be expelled.

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,168
Classes are canceled tomorrow.

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,130
They will resume Wednesday.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,605
There will be a quiz.

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,084
Alice.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,366
Okay...

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,807
- Um...
- Don't.

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,609
Hey, we did that spell.

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,409
You don't get to say,
"Don't," okay?

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,084
If they find out...

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,049
There they are.

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,691
- Glad to see you, kid.
- Oh, you poor thing.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,643
- Nurse?
- Are you okay?

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,128
No, it's okay, we're just
gonna get you a nice drink.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,885
Jesus, you didn't tell me
you were dangerous.

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,243
Damn it.

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,765
And damn it.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,403
Pretty sure my boyfriend's starting
to get curious where I am.

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,482
Oh, Jesus Christ,
it's cold.

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,449
We're stuck, and they're
trying to kill us, so...

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,284
They're not trying
to kill us, okay?

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,840
These people are not
murderers. Trust me.

122
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,445
How do you know that?

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,046
Because, they don't
have the balls for it.

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,727
It's like some sort
of hazing ritual, a test.

125
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,087
I'm sick of flunking
tests right now.

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,085
I'm gonna figure it out.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,526
Nothing to see,
you louche little degenerates.

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,125
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,486
Whatever, Eliot.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,601
Welcome to the Physical
Kids' Cottage.

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,444
It's the single best
place on campus

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,329
for a number of reasons
that will become clear

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,324
as soon as you taste
our signature cocktail.

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,765
I've got to...

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,365
Try on this dress I have.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,920
It's perfect. It's made
exactly for those assets

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,367
you're hiding underneath
that pilgrim tent.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,283
Yes, you must. Trust me.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,521
<i>Après moi.</i>

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,161
On purpose?

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,527
Like, you guys
cast it, thinking,

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,682
"Oh, monster from another world.

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,444
"By all means, come on in."

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,841
So you messed up.

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,570
It's a little bit
bigger than messing up.

146
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,530
Than what? Than whatever blew
up the entire third year class?

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,807
There's a bad story
every few years around here.

148
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,166
I'm not sure that's avoidable.

149
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,126
Okay.

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,006
And if you confess...

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,650
- Then I'm done.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,050
Argh...

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,084
Before I got here,
I was in the hospital.

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,891
I have... Or I had...

155
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,089
I don't know, uh, this thing that I
couldn't shake where I felt like

156
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,767
because nothing was ever not gonna
be pointless and empty, then,

157
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,683
Uh, Why go on?

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,926
And then I got here, and...

159
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,450
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

160
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,648
not knowing that
I was a Magician.

161
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,921
I can't go back.

162
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,126
So, okay.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,765
There is a spell, uh, if they question
you, so they can't read your minds.

164
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,649
I'll write it down.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,370
It's bulletproof.

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,521
Thank you.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,448
Now, can you just
help me live with myself?

168
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,811
Okay,
I'm gonna tell you something

169
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,087
deep and dark and personal now.

170
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,685
Ready? Good.
I killed someone.

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,321
What?

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,522
I was 14. He was this...

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,527
He beat me up.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,001
So I'm walking on the street
eating a candy bar,

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,323
'cause by then I already ate my
feelings at a professional level,

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,449
and I saw him crossing over.

177
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,002
And there was this bus coming.

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,048
I barely thought the thought.

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,481
Barn.

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,244
I knew immediately
what I'd done, that it was me.

181
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,322
My nose literally
started bleeding.

182
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,048
Logan Kinear died instantly and I
ruined my favorite button-down.

183
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,925
And that is the story of how I
discovered I was telekinetic.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,809
If you're trying to tell
me that it gets better...

185
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
Oh, God, no. No, it doesn't.

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,449
I'm trying to tell you,
you are not alone here.

187
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,569
Funny little irony
they don't tell you,

188
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,564
magic doesn't come from talent.

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,041
It comes from pain.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,647
So, do you know what it was,
the thing that attacked you?

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,366
- No, I have no idea.
- Oh.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,445
I thought you might be familiar

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,921
with some pretty crazy shit
since your family.

194
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,008
Yeah, no, my family's not...

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,889
- Right.
- Yeah.

196
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,041
I get it.

197
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,602
Mine too.

198
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,001
Pointless and toxic.

199
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,246
I didn't really learn
magic formally as a kid.

200
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,325
I heard you never got invited to
take the Brakebills entrance exam.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,321
How'd you even find it?
You walked right in.

202
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,565
It's not that hard.

203
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,568
We're in the Bermuda Triangle
of upstate New York.

204
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,523
How'd you get through though?

205
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,690
The wards around the school
are fingerprinted.

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,921
You're a stranger.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,851
My parents have alumni keys.

208
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,729
Which are supposed to be charmed

209
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,450
with McNaughton's Unstealable.

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,045
I stole one.

211
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,121
Hmm.

212
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,281
Um...

213
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,882
I just wanted to go to school.

214
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,885
Why do you care?

215
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,325
Curious.

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,521
Just 'cause...

217
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,365
I don't know.

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,965
I want to be
your friend, I guess.

219
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,531
I don't feel like you do.

220
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm sorry, I should go.
Thank you.

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,931
There has to be something here.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,049
Maybe the phone numbers
are, like, a code or...

223
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,650
That's too easy.

224
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,445
Come on.

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,441
Chop-chop.

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,648
There has to be something.
I mean...

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,641
Oh!

228
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,448
Is it...

229
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,170
Dead? Mmm-hmm, yeah.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,969
But it was already dead,
so I don't know.

231
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,485
Oh, my God.

232
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,528
Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us.

233
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,483
Why did I sign up for this?
This is...

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,011
- Stop it, stop, okay?
- Okay, okay.

235
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,321
It's dead dead now, I think.

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,761
I don't know.

237
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,686
Calm down.
Jesus, guys, it's me.

238
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,046
Pete, is that you?

239
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,610
Howdy.

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,526
Oh, Pete, that's definitely a good
look for you, an improvement.

241
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,841
Why don't you join us in here?
I think Marina misses you.

242
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,285
Just let us out.

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,408
Don't be stupid.
You have to find your way out.

244
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,960
So this is a test, another test.

245
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,690
Look, if you can't
get through this,

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,969
you definitely can't deal with
what it takes to do what we do.

247
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,361
Do you want magic or not, Julia?

248
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,204
Did you look everywhere?

249
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,282
Fast, frostbite's gonna set in.

250
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,725
Asshole. Shit.

251
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,961
What did that mean?

252
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,611
Uh, where didn't we look?

253
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,287
Wait.

254
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,849
<i>"Une chaleur temporaire."</i>

255
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,011
Temporary warmth.

256
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,689
I was just researching.

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,921
Reading a kids' book?

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,161
What do you want from me, huh?

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,890
Jesus, we could not
have screwed up

260
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,405
that spell worse,
and we can't take it back,

261
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,249
and you don't even like me.

262
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,446
I don't know you.

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,726
I don't know you either,

264
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,009
except that we summoned some kind of
killer mothman from another world.

265
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,491
Yeah, there is that.

266
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,008
You should hate me right now.
I dragged you into this.

267
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,770
It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand,

268
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,763
and it was the same one that
was on the book that I needed,

269
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,764
and my brother,
his spirit, I mean,

270
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,842
sent you to help me contact him.

271
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,127
So, I'm not really sure
that that's what happened.

272
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,407
The thing on my hand,
the sigil,

273
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,883
uh, it appeared when
I was dreaming of Fillory.

274
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,805
Okay.

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,487
In my dream,
the sigil on my hand,

276
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
it came from Jane.

277
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,690
Chatwin. From Fillory.

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,331
Look, honestly, Quentin,
growing up,

279
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,880
the last thing I wanted
to do was read fantasy.

280
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,721
Okay. What if, um...

281
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,803
What if Fillory is real?

282
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,530
And I know that you think that
this is just about Charlie,

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,489
but I think maybe it's bigger,

284
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,086
because what came through that
mirror instead of Charlie,

285
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,845
it didn't exactly grow up
in the neighborhood.

286
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,411
Okay.

287
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,166
So what if it came from,
like, actual Fillory?

288
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,010
That's a leap, Quentin.

289
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,369
I mean, there are other worlds out
there, but Fillory is just fiction.

290
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,683
Oh, no, the uh,
Chatwins, they're real.

291
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,807
They lived next door
to the author.

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,291
He based the characters on them.

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,364
Jesus, how do you
not know any of this?

294
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,569
Is there, um, someplace on campus
we can to go to watch a video?

295
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,802
- Yeah.
- Good.

296
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,366
<i>After living next
door to the Chatwins for years</i>

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,283
<i>and writing stories
for young Jane and Martin,</i>

298
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,204
<i>when Martin Chatwin disappeared,</i>

299
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,203
<i>Christopher Plover
was devastated.</i>

300
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,286
<i>This was just one of a series of painful
events that haunted Christopher Plover.</i>

301
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,647
<i>It suffused his work with a
sense of melancholy and loss.</i>

302
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,123
<i>And the mystery of
Martin Chatwin's disappearance</i>

303
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,123
<i>was never solved.</i>

304
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,801
<i>Even more mysterious,</i>

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,405
<i>Martin's sister Jane disappeared</i>

306
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,970
<i>the following year.</i>

307
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,166
That's a lot of disappearing.

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,442
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of why
people are obsessed with the books,

309
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,569
'cause you have these kids walking
into clocks, uh, into other worlds,

310
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,801
and they're based on real kids,

311
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,803
and the real kids, uh, vanished.

312
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,564
You're saying that
Charlie vanished too...

313
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,244
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't know.

314
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,810
I don't know what happened
to Charlie or anyone.

315
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,167
I don't, uh, know.

316
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,131
I mean look, we called
something from another world.

317
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,806
I don't know, can that
really be a coincidence?

318
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,405
So what do we do?

319
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,604
Don't get caught.
I can't get kicked out.

320
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,966
I mean, I have to find out
what happened to him.

321
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,010
Yeah, I know, but...

322
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,525
What if Fillory is real?

323
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,923
Jesus, you don't understand how
mind-blowing that is. It's just like...

324
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,604
Do you want to
stay at Brakebills?

325
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,682
- Yes.
- Okay, so do I.

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,724
So let's just hide the evidence
and get our story straight.

327
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,847
Okay?

328
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,210
What, you're leaving?

329
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,123
- I'm gone.
- Come on.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,488
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

331
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,369
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

332
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,444
You want the truth? No sweat.

333
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,522
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

334
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,487
Couple lines, right mix of meds.

335
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,164
But you heard Quentin
and Alice in the lab.

336
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,401
No, I didn't.

337
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,165
There's this voice.

338
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,651
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

339
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,724
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

340
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,250
Says he's a Magician.
That's...

341
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,043
That's all I know about him.

342
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,408
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

343
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,686
Holy shit.

344
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,003
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly non-stop fun growing up.

345
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,162
That's why I love that voice.

346
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,961
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

347
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,761
Yeah, right up until
he sent me to a lab to help,

348
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,003
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

349
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,686
- You were hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

350
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,003
But, do they know?
I mean, Sunderland, anyone?

351
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,408
No, there's no point now.

352
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,687
But don't... Penny, don't go.

353
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,366
Come on. It's not your fault.

354
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,726
He tricked you.

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,041
Come on, don't be stupid.

356
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,202
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

357
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,805
that might actually
be able to help you with this?

358
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,206
Why do you care?

359
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,806
Look, I did
the spell too, Penny.

360
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,724
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

361
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,961
You're guilty.

362
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay, great,
let's jump off a bridge.

363
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,007
Kady.

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,926
I can't stand it.

365
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,367
Okay.

366
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,281
Go.

367
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,006
But...

368
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,971
Hey, since you're out anyway,

369
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,527
come do something stupid
with me before you go.

370
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,766
Come on.

371
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,688
Yeah, 'cause crushed rocks,

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,082
you see that in spells that have
a concentrated area of effect.

373
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,049
I'm sorry, you knew this and you
didn't want to say anything?

374
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,565
Okay, well,
I don't know what I know.

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,123
Years reading Internet crap and
accidentally poisoning myself twice,

376
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,561
and now I'm stuck
in a freezer with some bitch.

377
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,721
Well, you are.

378
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,043
What, did you figure you wanted
magic at your blow dry last week?

379
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,690
This is serious for some of us.

380
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,366
Okay, you know what? I'm not
interested in your personal issues.

381
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,603
Hey.

382
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,286
There was sand
in that paint can.

383
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,048
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need a knife and a bowl.

384
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,963
Okay.

385
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,804
And...

386
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,771
<i>"Graisse de l'animal...
De préférence de mouton."</i>

387
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,888
Animal fat. Mutton.

388
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,291
Maybe there's meat?

389
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,521
Come on, let's go before
we freeze our tits off.

390
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,484
This isn’t just some
lark to me, so you know.

391
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,564
No offense, okay, you just smell
a little Ivy League to me.

392
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,723
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

393
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,609
I was.

394
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,250
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

395
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,169
Well, it's like this
secret Yale, but for magic.

396
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,241
What?

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,845
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

398
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,365
Well, I can do magic.

399
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,090
Yeah, so can I.

400
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
And yet, somehow,
I flunked the entrance exam.

401
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,449
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

402
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,690
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

403
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,683
I mean, seriously,
what do they expect, you know?

404
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,889
Magic is real and that's the thing,
and once you know that, you can't...

405
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,450
Nothing else matters.

406
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,803
Exactly.

407
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,927
It's like...

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,161
I know it's there.

409
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,687
It's everywhere, all around me,

410
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,209
a whole world
of power and beauty.

411
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,686
You can't unsee it.

412
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,851
You wake up for the first time.

413
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,001
Yeah.

414
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,327
Who are we kidding?

415
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,971
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

416
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,525
No, no way, I cannot do that.

417
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Mmm-mmm.
No, please do that.

418
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,651
<i>I let my old life
tie me to the tracks</i>

419
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,451
<i>I heard my best friend tell me</i>

420
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,966
<i>You can never go back</i>

421
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,764
<i>I spent my long years</i>

422
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,969
<i>Learning to get out of the way</i>

423
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,451
<i>I have been taught
to turn the other cheek</i>

424
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,969
<i>I get my back stabbed, buddy
to the end of the week</i>

425
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,201
<i>I only try to make it
to the end of the day</i>

426
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,966
<i>I've seen it break
so many before</i>

427
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,886
<i>I don't wanna stick
around here and watch anymore</i>

428
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,041
- Mmm.
- Oh...

429
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,088
Yo, this one looks bunk.

430
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,288
Well, it's not.
It's Emerson's Alloy.

431
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,249
Uh, alloy's rusting.

432
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,406
How do you know?

433
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
'Cause I know things.

434
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,888
Like this place...
What? It's a gold mine.

435
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,645
Look, you can't
run away from you.

436
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,645
And, well, I'm here,
and I'm amazing, so I mean...

437
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,925
I'll take it under
advisement, okay?

438
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,570
Hey.

439
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,244
No, leave us alone.

440
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,163
Gladly, we've got
to discuss, um...

441
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,246
There you are, Quentin and
Alice, and Penny and Kady.

442
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,402
You're exactly who
I was looking for.

443
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,684
I found the most interesting
thing buried in our woods.

444
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,081
Follow me.

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,162
We never got near
the mirror, I swear.

446
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,681
We were studying, that's all.

447
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,762
What language even is this?

448
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,050
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

449
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,282
We all touched it.
I mean, I touched...

450
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,170
We were studying, so...

451
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,210
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

452
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,123
There's residue
all over this book,

453
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,487
including a summoning

454
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,562
we believe opened
the door to The Beast.

455
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,483
What did you say?

456
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,681
Nothing, I...

457
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,646
Don't look at me.

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
Look, I know
they're your friends.

459
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,123
Okay, at this point, I just have
to assume it was all of you.

460
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,168
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

461
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,289
Shut up and I'll
tell you, happily.

462
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,561
It's fine, let's go.

463
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,046
You're welcome, by the way.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,206
What does that mean?

465
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,403
Quentin, can I see you, please?

466
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,845
Alice, you're free to go.

467
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,764
There's nothing I
can do in this moment

468
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,047
to stop the comet from crashing
into the earth, is there?

469
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,201
Hold On.

470
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,887
Uh...

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,047
What is this?

472
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,124
My books. I'm headed to return them.
You've heard, I assume.

473
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,964
Word travels fast
when your life's over.

474
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,246
Don't say that.

475
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,045
They're bringing
in a specialist.

476
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,442
Yeah, thanks. Ominous.

477
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,851
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,850
I don't know, I keep trying to tell
myself this is somehow better,

479
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,809
you know, not to know.

480
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,444
'Cause who would want
to know that magic exists

481
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,965
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

482
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,804
if there's no one
to teach you or help you.

483
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,406
I don't know what to say.

484
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,051
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

485
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,686
You don't see color and want
to go back to black and white.

486
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,281
You do not have to make
me feel better really,

487
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
we basically
just met each other.

488
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,729
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

489
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,963
Look, don't go out
there and be the old you.

490
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,804
How, Eliot?

491
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,484
I go back there, and I'm...

492
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,170
I'm a depressed super nerd.

493
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,483
How about I find you,
and I don't say magic is real,

494
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,490
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

495
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,769
that life retains
its sparkle for decades.

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,609
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Thank you.

497
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,886
Okay.

498
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,284
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

499
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,169
I don't know.

500
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,050
I've heard of the specialist,
and all I can say is,

501
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,451
I hear they're very good.

502
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,850
<i>This is
Julia, little busy. Leave a message.</i>

503
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,287
Hey, it's Q.

504
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,567
<i>Look, I know when
we last met that, uh...</i>

505
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,521
<i>I'm sorry, Jules. I am.</i>

506
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>I didn't know what it
must be like for you,</i>

507
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,327
<i>and I, um, I hope that
you are doing better.</i>

508
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,284
Oh, my God,
you're just going for it.

509
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,690
So, I got expelled, and they
are sending in a specialist

510
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,608
because the local brain wipe
guy is dead, and long story.

511
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,011
<i>Um...</i>

512
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,402
So if you remember or you figured
out why it didn't work on you,

513
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,084
I'd like to know that,
about now,

514
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,562
<i>because I need you to remind
me that magic is real.</i>

515
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,606
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

516
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,206
You know, without Brakebills,
it's just...

517
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,487
I'm lost and you're not.

518
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,730
Magic.

519
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,609
Okay.

520
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,682
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

521
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,446
You can't help and
I can't help you,

522
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,443
and it's just...

523
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,410
<i>To send

525
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
<i>Deleted.</i>

526
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,361
Hey!

527
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,921
You little piece of shit.

528
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,764
- You ratted me out.
- I told the truth.

529
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,330
- Not all of it.
- Oh, am I a fool?

530
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,845
Apparently not.

531
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,161
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

532
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,125
What the hell was that,
you maniac?

533
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,885
Hey! Step back, both of you!
Who shot off that spell?

534
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,803
- He did!
- I did.

535
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,291
Infirmary, both of you, now.

536
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,683
Figured it out.

537
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,287
The spell, or, you know, the whole
point, that there isn't one.

538
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,604
Not to get out of the room, not
to keep the door locked, nada.

539
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,170
Cute, Pete.

540
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,449
Oh, and scissors make a shitty
screwdriver, by the way.

541
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,601
Good for you.

542
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,887
Now you get why it
was so important.

543
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,883
Uh, to almost die for no reason?

544
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,362
To figure out that not
everything gets solved by magic.

545
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,363
Key fact if you
want to last the month.

546
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,568
You're not still debating letting
me into your club, are you?

547
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,722
Hey, I invited you.

548
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,521
No, you attacked me in a bar,
in a bathroom, on my birthday.

549
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,409
I'm done trying
to prove myself to you.

550
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,766
You weren't.

551
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,487
You were trying
to prove yourself to me.

552
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,609
That means level 50.

553
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,601
Um...

554
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,641
Uh...

555
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,802
Wait, so you were...

556
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,690
Top bitch in New York,
for starters.

557
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,444
Um, and this was...

558
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,046
Me discovering
how much I like you.

559
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,886
You are smart. You're passionate.
You question things.

560
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,450
You messed with my head!

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,045
Think about how much you
learned about how to do that

562
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,003
for when you're level 50.

563
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,408
- Hey, don't be mad.
- Don't be mad.

564
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,050
How am I supposed to trust you?

565
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,770
Why would you ever trust anyone?

566
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,889
I am willing to teach the right
people everything I know,

567
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,287
and I know a lot,

568
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,921
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

569
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,288
just like,
for instance, Brakebills.

570
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,764
Brakebills.

571
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,047
- You want a drink?
- Let's get a drink.

572
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,045
Might burn a little.

573
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,329
This is why you're not supposed to
throw this kind of magic around.

574
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,243
If you’re lucky, I can fix this.

575
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,731
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

576
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,648
That's actually...

577
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,921
Hold still, please.

578
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,729
- Pussy.
- Nobody asked you.

579
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,406
Me, the guy you
threw battle magic at?

580
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,170
Hey, have you heard of karma?

581
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,527
Well, sometimes it's instant.

582
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,364
You're welcome.

583
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,011
What is that? How did you...

584
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,764
Real Magicians
protect themselves.

585
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,960
Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

586
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,201
She's late.

587
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,520
She's coming.

588
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,604
Or she's just
done with your shit.

589
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,250
She doesn't have the option.

590
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,601
Finally.

591
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,041
Hey, look, that thing you wanted,
that charm or crystal or whatever?

592
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,963
The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?

593
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,371
Yeah, this guy I was with,
he grabbed it.

594
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,006
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

595
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,889
And more.

596
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,042
Here.

597
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,451
There's a ton
of good shit in there.

598
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,921
Listen to all that backpedaling.

599
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,968
I'll get it, okay?

600
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,522
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

601
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,251
Great. You're
a sweet girl, Kady.

602
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,049
You're a heartless bitch.

603
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,203
I'm generous with you,
considering.

604
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,846
Get me everything on
this list, this week.

605
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,369
Thanks so much.

606
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,930
You better get back to bed, hon.

607
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,331
I'm sure you got
class in the morning.

608
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,203
- Hi.
- Oh...

609
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,126
Caught me where I'm not meant
to be, a terminal snooper.

610
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,966
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

611
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,125
You were there the day
of the alumni interview.

612
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,725
You were a paramedic.

613
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,330
Call me Eliza.

614
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,562
I was there that day to make
sure that you got here.

615
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,281
Oh...

616
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,331
Well, uh, thank you,

617
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,404
but I kind of screwed that up.

618
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,001
Uh...

619
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,884
They're calling in a specialist.

620
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,760
He's supposed to, um, wipe it all
away like it never happened.

621
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,490
Mmm. That sounds...

622
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,490
Hmm...

623
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,411
You know,
I'm the specialist? Sorry.

624
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,531
Shall we sit?

625
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,011
Okay. Okay.

626
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,286
Okay.

627
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,530
Um, just before, um, can I...

628
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,883
Um, why did you
give me that book?

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,009
<i>Fillory and Further</i>, book six.

630
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,841
I thought you'd appreciate it.

631
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,251
I lost it.

632
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
Guess I was wrong.

633
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,642
No, you're not, I...

634
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,485
I need to read it.
I just, I can't find it.

635
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,608
Things with Fillory
are funny that way.

636
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,485
Is Fillory real?

637
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,211
Why even ask if you'll
just forget it again?

638
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,645
The books, they're just...

639
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,361
They always felt
realer than anything.

640
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,565
Then it's real.

641
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,404
That's not a real answer.

642
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,641
Shall we begin?

643
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,127
Okay, do it.

644
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,369
Oh, Quentin,
I am pleased!

645
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,241
What? Why?

646
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
You're a much better liar
than I expected you to be.

647
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,971
Can I level with you?

648
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,530
I wish you would.

649
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,443
You're not very remarkable.

650
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,929
You're smart, but no genius.

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,287
You do magic,
but nothing special.

652
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,766
And the worst is,
you're so eager to belong,

653
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,410
you even forget why you're here.

654
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,766
Why am I here?

655
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,363
You dreamed of it, didn't you?

656
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,082
Fillory, before the attack,
like a warning?

657
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,964
Yeah, how did you...

658
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,530
Because I've dreamed of it too.

659
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,126
And I've looked
into that Beast's eyes.

660
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,361
What?

661
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,049
Do you think you have a destiny?

662
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,971
Um, yes.

663
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,530
Yeah.

664
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,807
I used to believe that
crap too when I was young.

665
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,249
There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

666
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,207
I can't tell you why The Beast
came sniffing for you.

667
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,929
There's no reason
it should be you.

668
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,168
You can either step up
to it or not, it's up to you.

669
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,288
We'll just hope for the best.

670
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,526
Who are you?

671
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,889
Just another inadequate
Magician who's lost people.

672
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,370
So will you if you
don't get strong.

673
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,250
Learn fast, any means necessary.

674
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,408
Which is why I'm so pleased
to see you sitting there

675
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,721
like you don't have
an Emerson's in your pocket

676
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,842
to repel any spell
to wipe your mind.

677
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,285
Uh, you stole that.

678
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,691
Who stole it?

679
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,483
Relax, nobody's
taking your mind today.

680
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,841
We'll make something of you yet.

681
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,163
I'll tell the school
one more chance, probation.

682
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,765
They'll respect my call.

683
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,890
Don't make me regret it.

684
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,851
Don't hop back on the garden
path like some little lemming,

685
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,207
or I'll erase everything
and start you over entirely,

686
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,691
for your own good.

687
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,091
The garden path?

688
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,607
Everything's connected.
Don't over-think it.

689
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,770
<i>All of Bobby's flowers
going to stand up straight</i>

690
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,607
<i>All of Bobby's flowers
going to stand up straight</i>

691
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,207
Congratulations, Julia.
Big day.

692
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,762
First star. First of many.

693
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,205
Yeah.

694
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,651
<i>Bobby put the flowers in his mama's car</i>

695
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,404
This is just the beginning.

696
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,922
<i>And he knew that they
wouldn't have to drive too far</i>

697
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,570
Hope your bits are covered.

698
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,681
Coming in.

699
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,245
How are you, Henry?

700
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,361
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,647
I knew he'd come, but I swear
I didn't know so soon.

702
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,051
No one is ready.

703
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,724
We need more time,

704
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,530
and a teacher with
full use of his hands.

705
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,761
There's that new wrinkle.

706
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,045
I'll find a way to help you.

707
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,801
We'll heal your
hands and your eyes.

708
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,406
It wouldn't help us. It
wouldn't help them, would it?

709
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,002
This is your problem,
that you should solve!

710
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,565
Quentin, Penny,
they're not built for this.

711
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,563
I know, and I've tried.

712
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,846
Go back there.

713
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,729
You say that like
I could hop a bus.

714
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,802
Find a way back.

715
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,486
Find The Beast. Kill him.

716
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,524
If I could manage that,
we'd be sharing a drink right now,

717
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,807
not a care in the world
and four good eyes between us.

718
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,968
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,042
Just tell me what else I can do.

720
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,767
All we can do is
make them Magicians.

721
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,365
That's not enough.

722
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,930
I know.

723
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,125
Gonna just keep this
BBQ poppin', my love.

724
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,601
Quentin!

725
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,006
- Get over here.
- Quentin.

726
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,128
- Come on!
- Come on!

727
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,124
Join the party, sad sack.
Hurry up.

728
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,761
Oh, my God, it's not
like we have all day.

729
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,127
- We're so drunk.
- Okay, we have all day.

730
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
