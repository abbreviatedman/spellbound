what did The Beast say to you?

How did it know
your name?

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,352
- So what is this place exactly,
besides a health hazard?

11
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:56,922
- Time was, the finest meat
packing plant in town.

12
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,758
- Yeah,
it's a winner.

13

Does it mean that--

16

- You ask a lot
of questions.

all our ingredients and such.

of this entity,

- Because, they don't have
the balls for it.

It's like some sort
of hazing ritual, a test.

00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,621
- I'm sorry.

525
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,091
- I don't know,
I keep trying to tell myself

526
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:06,096
this is somehow better,
you know, not to know.

527
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,099
'Cause who would want to know
that--that magic exists

528
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,634
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

529
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,469
if there's no one to teach you
or help you.

530
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,972
- I...don't know
what to say.

531
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,741
- Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

532
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,844
You don't see color
and want to go black and white.

533
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,246
[sighs]

534
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,015
You do not have to make me
feel better, we--

535
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,284
really, we basically
just met each other.

536
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:31,322
- Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

537
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:34,825
Look, don't go out there
and be the old you.

538
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,460
- How, Eliot?

539
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,263
I go back there,
and I'm...

540
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,098
I'm a depressed super nerd.

541
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,168
- How about I find you,
and I don't say magic is real,

542
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,137
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

543
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:51,308
that life retains
its sparkle for decades.

544
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,277
- Yeah, that sounds nice.
Thank you.

545
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,346
- Okay.

546
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,050
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

547
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,819
- I don't know.

548
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,722
I've heard of the Specialist,
and all I can say is,

549
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,256
I hear they're very good.

550
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,193
[depositing coins]

551
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:12,262

552
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,301
<i>[line trills]</i>

553
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:21,171

<i>Leave a message.</i>

00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,873
<i>[beeps]</i>

555
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,308
- Hey, it's Q.

556
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,911
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>when we last met that--</i>

557
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,180
<i>I'm sorry, Jules.</i>
<i>I am.</i>

558
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:34,084
<i>I didn't know it,</i>
<i>what it must be like for you,</i>

559
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:39,490
<i>and I-I, um, I hope that</i>
<i>you are doing better.</i>

560
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,325
- [grunts]

561
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,660
- Oh, my God,
you're just going for it.

562
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,429
Ugh.
- [grunting]

563
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,365
- Um, so I got expelled and they
are sending in a Specialist

564
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:55,439
because the local brain wipe guy
is dead and--long story. Um--

565
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,943
So if you remember
or you figured out

566
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,379
why it didn't work on you,
I'd like to know that about now

567
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,883
<i>because I need you to remind me</i>
<i>that magic is real.</i>

568
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:13,257
- Oh, yeah.
[laughing] Yeah.

569
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,060
- You know,
without Brakebills, it's just,

570
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,362
I'm lost and you're not.

571
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,398
- Magic, oh ho.

572
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,300
- Okay.

573
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,335
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

574
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,440
- You can't help
and I can't help you,

575
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:31,108
and it's just--
<i>[beeps]</i>

- Hey!

581
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,232
- Ho, ho, ho,
you little piece of shit.

582
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,437
- You ratted me out.
- I told the truth.

583
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,972
- Not all of it.
- Oh, am I a fool?

584
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,607
- [groans]
- Apparently not.

585
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,510
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

586
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,379
- [groans]

587
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,806
- What the hell was that,
you maniac?

588
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,641
- Hey!
Step back, both of you!

589
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:38,642
Who shot off that spell?

590
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:42,479
- He did!
- I did.

591
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:45,549
- Infirmary,
both of you, now.

592
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,391
- Figured it out.

593
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,860
The spell, or, you know,
the whole point,

594
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,463
that there isn't one--
not to get out of the room,

595
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,299
not to
keep the door locked, nada.

596
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,867
Cute, Pete.

597
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,236
Oh, and scissors make
a shitty screw driver,

598
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:09,306
by the way.

599
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,548
- Good for you.

600
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,750
Now you get why
it was so important.

601
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:21,652
- To almost die
for no reason?

602
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:22,719
- To figure out
that not everything

603
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,022
gets solved by magic.

604
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,024
Key fact if you want
to last the month.

605
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,225
- You're not
still debating

606
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,393
letting me into your club,
are you?

607
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,428
- Hey, I invited you.

608
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,664
- No, you attacked me
in a bar,

609
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,432
in the bathroom,
on my birthday.

610
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,067
I'm done trying
to prove myself to you.

611
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,870
- You weren't.

612
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,940
You were trying
to prove yourself to me.

613
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,446
- That means level 50.

614
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,183
- Um...

615
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,453
Uh, wait,
s-so you were--

616
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,356
- Top bitch in New York,
for starters.

617
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,091
- Um, and this was--

618
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,727
- Me discovering
how much I like you.

619
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,396
You are smart.
You're passionate.

620
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,564
You question things.

621
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:08,866
- You messed with my head!

622
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,400
- Think about how much
you learned

623
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,202
about how to do that
for when you're level 50.

624
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,637
- [scoffs]

625
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,072
- Hey, don't be mad.
- Don't be mad.

626
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,907
- How am I supposed
to trust you?

627
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,910
- Why would you ever
trust anyone?

628
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,311
I am willing to teach
the right people

629
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:26,049
everything I know,
and I know a lot,

630
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,586
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

631
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:33,357
just like, for instance,
Brakebills.

632
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,427
- Brakebills.

633
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,595
- You want a drink?

634
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,664
- Let's get a drink.

635
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,772
Might burn a little.

636
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:49,806
This is why you're not
supposed to throw

637
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,942
this kind of magic
around.

638
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,977
If you're lucky
I can fix this.

639
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,445
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

640
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,914
- Yeah, so lucky.

641
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:06,390
Ooh.
that's actually--

642
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,524
[sucks in air]

643
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,659
[screams]

644
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:09,693
- Hold still, please.

645
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:12,229
- [groaning]

646
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,464
[whimpering]

647
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,366
- Pussy.
- Nobody asked you.

648
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,069
- Me, the guy
you threw battle magic at?

649
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,837
Hey, have you
heard of karma?

650
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,307
Well, sometimes
it's instant.

651
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,008
You're welcome.

652
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,644
- What is that?
How--how did you--

653
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,047
- Real Magicians
protect themselves.

654
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,683
- Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

655
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:34,885
- [laughs]

656
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,822
<i>- [sighs]</i>
<i>She's late.</i>

657
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,324
<i>- She's coming.</i>

658
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,260
<i>- Or she's just</i>
<i>done with your shit.</i>

659
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:46,330
<i>- She doesn't have</i>
<i>the option.</i>

660
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,269
- Finally.

661
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,539
- Hey, look,
that thing you wanted,

662
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,708
that charm or crystal
or whatever?

663
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,177
- The Emerson's
Alloy Repellant?

664
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,347
- Yeah, this guy I was with,
he grabbed it.

665
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,849
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

666
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,517
And more.

667
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,720
Here.

668
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:11,088
There's a ton
of good shit in there.

669
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,690
- Hmm, listen to all that
backpedaling.

670
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,792
- I'll get it, okay?

671
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:19,262
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

672
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,965
- Great.
You're a sweet girl, Kady.

673
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,767
- You're a heartless bitch.

674
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,970
- I'm generous with you,
considering.

675
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,676
Get me everything on this list,
this week.

676
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,113
Thanks so much.

677
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,614
You better get
back to bed, hon.

678
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,049
I'm sure you got class
in the morning.

679
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,857
- Hi.
- Oh.

680
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,761
Caught me where I'm not
meant to be, a terminal snooper.

681
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:28,932
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

682
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:32,269
- You--you were--you were there
the day of the alumni interview.

683
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,304
I--
You were a paramedic.

684
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,972
- Call me Eliza.

685
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,776
I was there that day
to make sure that you got here.

686
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,344
- Oh.

687
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:47,350
Well, uh, thank you,
but I kind of screwed that up.

688
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,852
Um...

689
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,620
They're calling
in a Specialist.

690
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:54,791
He's supposed to wipe it all
away like it never happened.

691
00:34:55,894 --> 00:35:00,030
- That sounds--
Hmm.

692
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:04,968
You know, I'm the Specialist?
Sorry.

693
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,903
Shall we sit?

694
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:12,642
- Okay.
Okay.

695
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,212
Okay.

696
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:19,015
Um, just before,
um, can I--

697
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,750
Why did you give me
that book?

698
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,254
"Fillory and Further,"
book six.

699
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,189
- I thought you'd
appreciate it.

700
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,224

701
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,325

I just, I can't find it.

are funny that way.

705
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,369
- Is "Fillory" real?

706
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,873
- Why even ask if you'll just
forget it again?

707
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,709

they're just--

708

realer than anything.

709

a real answer.

Why?

721

you're so eager to belong,

722

why you're here.

723

- You dreamed of it,
didn't you,

725
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:42,732
"Fillory," before the attack,
like a warning?

726
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,668
- Yeah, did you--
how did you?

727
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,369
- Because I've dreamed
of it too.

728
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,108
And I've looked
into that Beast's eyes.

729
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,810

a destiny?

when I was young.

sniffing for you.

it should be you.
