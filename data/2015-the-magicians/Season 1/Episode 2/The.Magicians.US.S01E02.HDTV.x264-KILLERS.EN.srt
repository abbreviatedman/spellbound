1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,956
Mr. Coldwater?

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:07,458
Quentin.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,492
Quentin?

4
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:15,265
Quentin!

5
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,468
Describe The Beast
that attacked you.

6
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,470
Uh.

7
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,608
How did it get in here?

8
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:36,051
Mr. Coldwater,
what did The Beast say to you?

9
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:41,023
How did it know your name?

10
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:52,367
So what is this place exactly,
besides a health hazard?

11
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,937
Time was, the finest meat
packing plant in town.

12
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:58,773
Yeah, it's a winner.

13
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,342
- Hey, that star on your arm--
- I earned it.

14
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:04,646
You will too with effort,
whole sleeve of 'em.

15
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,313
So what does it mean?
Does it mean that--

16
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,616
You ask a lot of questions.

17
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:10,751
Yeah, I sure do.

18
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,393
Oh, my God, these are real?
Every one of them?

19
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,964
Guys, this is Julia.
Julia, my associates.

20
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,065
Holy shit, it's--

21
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,033
And that is--

22
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:28,668
I'm sorry, what's your name,
sweetie?

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,502
I'm Marina.
I'm new.

24
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:31,871
Yeah, no kidding.

25
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:33,205
Everything up and running?

26
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:34,640
Yeah.

27
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:38,911
Julia, Marina.
Grand tour.

28
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,650
Wait, so who were
those people exactly?

29
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,185
You seriously don't know?

30
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:50,188
- What are you even doing here?
- I don't know.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,257
I'm waiting for something
interesting to happen.

32
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,660
- You?
- Magic is what I'm doing here.

33
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:58,096
They're hedge witches.
We're hedge witches.

34
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,764
Jesus,
how are you even--

35
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:03,067
Girls, play nice.

36
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,736
So here is where we keep
all our ingredients and such.

37
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:07,270
Keeps them safe.

38
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,039
- It's a--
- Meat locker,

39
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,008
or it was anyway.

40
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,077
Now it is so well stocked,

41
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,445
it's like the end
of the rainbow.

42
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:18,480
After you.

43
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,384
Hey!

44
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,421
Come on, open the door.

45
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,224
Hey--

46
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:29,859
Hey!

47
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,594
Hey, don't be an asshole.

48
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:34,563
Open the door!
Dude!

49
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:44,528
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

50
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:47,209
We were frozen.

51
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:50,212
Some kind of paralysis spell...

52
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:52,780
took over the whole room.

53
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:05,392
Let's just nip this all
in the bud.

54
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,061
I already told you,

55
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,562
the Dean had something
in his hand.

56
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,897
I don't know where
it went after that.

57
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,935
You can materialize objects?

58
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:18,972
I've been doing card tricks
half my life.

59
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:22,008
I guess some of them
were disappearing.

60
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:36,488
Quentin...

61
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,657
take this.

62
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,433
Is he dead?

63
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,835
The--the Dean?

64
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,107
- Kady!
- How did you know that spell?

65
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,775
Look, I know we're not
supposed to fire off

66
00:03:57,777 --> 00:04:00,543
battle magic,
but...I mean, come on.

67
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,854
Can we just get
out of this room soon?

68
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,088
Please?

69
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,234
I know you want
to understand what happened.

70
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:26,969
Here's what I can say.

71
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:31,406
We live in a world that is
one world among many.

72
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:34,209
The Beast you saw was
from one such place.

73
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:36,644
We do not know the exact nature
of this entity,

74
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:40,748
only that it was powerful
and malevolent.

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,583
Stop it!

76
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:45,619
<i>And we know that it is gone now.</i>

77
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:59,967
Wards and shields
protect Brakebills.

78
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:02,936
They are encoded to each
authorized person on campus

79
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:04,872
and no one else.

80
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:07,741
We are investigating
how this beast got through

81
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:10,076
and resetting everyone.

82
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:12,945
If someone is responsible
for this attack,

83
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:17,216
rest assured,
they will be expelled.

84
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,752
Classes are cancelled tomorrow.

85
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,321
They will resume Wednesday.

86
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,956
There will be a quiz.

87
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,728
Alice.

88
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,997
Okay, um--

89
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,131
Don't.

90
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,166
Hey, we did that spell.

91
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,634
You don't get to say don't,
okay?

92
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,336
If they find out--

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,338
There they are.

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,472
Glad to see you, kid.

95
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,973
Oh, you poor thing.

96
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,075
- Are you okay?
- Nurse?

97
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,678
No, it's okay, we're just
gonna get you a nice drink.

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,848
Jesus, you didn't tell me
you were dangerous.

99
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,585
Damn it.

100
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,521
Damn it.

101
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,423
And damn it.

102
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,525
Pretty sure my boyfriend's
starting to get curious

103
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:03,692
where I am.

104
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:05,795
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's cold.

105
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,863
We're stuck, and they're trying
to kill us, so--

106
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,598
They're not trying to kill us, okay?

107
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,168
These people are not murderers.
Trust me.

108
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,769
How do you know that?

109
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:16,338
Because, they don't have
the balls for it.

110
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,142
It's like some sort
of hazing ritual, a test.

111
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:23,979
I'm sick
of flunking tests right now.

112
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,713
I'm gonna figure it out.

113
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:43,831
Nothing to see,
you louche little degenerates.

114
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,699
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

115
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,734
Whatever, Eliot.

116
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,905
Welcome
to the Physical Kids' Cottage.

117
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,674
It's the single best place
on campus

118
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:56,809
for a number of reasons
that will become clear

119
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,579
as soon as you taste
our signature cocktail.

120
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,081
I-I've got to--

121
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,748
Try on this dress I have.

122
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,218
It's perfect. It's made
exactly for those assets

123
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,719
you're hiding
underneath that pilgrim tent.

124
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,554
Yes, you must.
Trust me.

125
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,023
<i>Après moi.</i>

126
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,496
On purpose?

127
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,831
Like, you guys cast it,
thinking,

128
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,933
"Oh, monster from another world.

129
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,802
By all means,
come on in."

130
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:29,173
So you messed up.

131
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:30,741
It's a little bit bigger
than messing up.

132
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:31,842
Than what?
Than whatever blew up

133
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,777
the entire third year class?

134
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,080
There's a bad story
every few years around here.

135
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:39,183
I'm not sure that's avoidable.

136
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:42,252
Okay.
And if you confess--

137
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,054
- Then I'm done.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,457
Uh--

139
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,559
Bef--

140
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,395
Before I got here,
I was in the hospital.

141
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:55,732
I have--or I had--
I don't know,

142
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,401
this thing that I couldn't shake
where I felt like

143
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,634
because nothing was ever
not gonna be

144
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:03,305
pointless and empty,
then, uh, why go on?

145
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:09,111
And then I...
got here, and...

146
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,612
it's amazing I survived
as long as I did

147
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,582
not knowing that I was
a Magician.

148
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,118
I can't go back.

149
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,088
So, okay.

150
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,956
There's a spell

151
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,092
if they question you
so they can't read your minds.

152
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:25,960
I'll write it down.

153
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,795
It's bulletproof.

154
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:29,797
Thank you.

155
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,768
Now, can you just help me
live with myself?

156
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:41,141
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
something deep and dark

157
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:42,342
and personal now.

158
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:43,977
Ready? Good.
I killed someone.

159
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:46,646
What?

160
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:50,283
I was 14.
He was this--

161
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:53,919
He beat me up.

162
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:56,322
So I'm walking on the street
eating a candy bar,

163
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,291
'cause by then I already
ate my feelings

164
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:02,928
at a professional level,
and I saw him crossing over.

165
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:08,633
And there was this bus coming.

166
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:11,803
I barely thought the thought.

167
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:13,705
Bam.

168
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:16,508
I knew immediately
what I'd done, that it was me.

169
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,612
My nose literally
started bleeding.

170
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:22,547
Logan Kinear died instantly

171
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,150
and I ruined
my favorite button-down.

172
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:32,022
And that is the story of how
I discovered I was telekinetic.

173
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:33,890
If you're trying to tell me
that it gets better--

174
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,459
Oh, God, no.
No, it doesn't.

175
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,996
I'm trying to tell you,
you are not alone here.

176
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,864
Funny little irony
they don't tell you,

177
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:46,302
magic doesn't come from talent.

178
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:48,671
It comes from pain.

179
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:55,978
So, do you know what it was,
the thing that attacked you?

180
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,148
- No, I have no idea.
- Oh.

181
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,715
I thought you might be familiar

182
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:04,919
with some pretty crazy shit
since you're family.

183
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:08,390
Yeah, no,
my family's not--

184
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:10,192
- Right.
- Yeah.

185
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:14,895
I get it.
Mine too.

186
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,365
Pointless and toxic.

187
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:24,772
I didn't really learn magic
formally as a kid.

188
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:26,274
I heard you never got invited

189
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:30,110
to take the Brakebills
entrance exam.

190
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,612
How'd you even find it?
You walked right in.

191
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:38,251
It's not that hard.

192
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:42,121
We're in the Bermuda Triangle
of Upstate New York.

193
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:44,924
How'd you get through though?

194
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,960
The wards around the school
are fingerprinted.

195
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,529
You're a stranger.

196
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:53,131
My parents have alumni keys.

197
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,800
Which are supposed to be charmed

198
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,935
with McNaughton's Unstealable.

199
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,970
I stole one.

200
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,673
Hmm.

201
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:07,312
Um, I just wanted
to go to school.

202
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,318
Why do you care?

203
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,587
Curious.

204
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,122
Just 'cause--

205
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,657
I don't know.

206
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,159
I want to be your friend,
I guess.

207
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:25,495
I don't feel like you do.

208
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,702
I'm sorry, I should go.
Thank you.

209
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:39,342
There has to be something here.

210
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:42,311
Maybe the phone numbers
are, like, a code or--

211
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,513
That's too easy.

212
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:53,489
Come on.

213
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:58,860
Chop chop.

214
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,543
There has to be something.
I mean--

215
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:13,779
Oh!

216
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,502
Is it--
is it--

217
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,304
Dead?
Mm-hmm, yeah,

218
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,073
but it was already dead,
so I don't know.

219
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,775
Oh, my God.

220
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,810
Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us.

221
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,078
Why did I sign up for this?
This is--

222
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,678
Shh, shh.
Stop it, stop, okay?

223
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:52,749
- Okay, okay.
- It's dead dead now, I think.

224
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:54,016
I don't know.

225
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,921
Calm down.
Jesus, guys, it's me.

226
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:00,322
Pete, is that you?

227
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:01,858
- Howdy.
- Wow.

228
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,526
Pete, that's definitely
a good look for you--

229
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:05,761
an improvement.

230
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:06,955
Why don't you join us in here?

231
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:08,130
I think Marina misses you.

232
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:09,631
Just let us out.

233
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,666
Don't be stupid.
You have to find your way out.

234
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,302
So this is a test, another test.

235
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,371
Look, if you can't
get through this, you definitely

236
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:19,207
can't deal with what it takes
to do what we do.

237
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:21,609
Do you want magic or not, Julia?

238
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,477
Did you look everywhere?

239
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,382
Fast, frostbite's gonna set in.

240
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,117
Asshole.
Shit.

241
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:31,718
What did that mean?

242
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:34,755
Where didn't we look?
Where didn't we look?

243
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,659
Wait.

244
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,169
Huh.

245
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,872
<i>"Une chaleur temporaire."</i>

246
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,507
Temporary warmth.

247
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:08,921
I was just researching.

248
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:10,189
Reading a kids' book?

249
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,590
What do you want from me?
I--

250
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,725
Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,

251
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,828
and we can't take it back,
and--

252
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,696
- you don't even like me.
- I don't know you.

253
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,690
I don't know you either,
except that we summoned

254
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:23,267
some kind of killer mothman
from another world.

255
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:24,869
Yeah, there is that.

256
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,274
You should hate me right now.
I dragged you into this.

257
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,009
It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand,

258
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:35,045
and it was the same one that was
on the book that I needed,

259
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,048
and my brother--
his spirit, I mean,

260
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:41,684
sent you to help me contact him.

261
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:46,389
So, I'm not really sure
that that's what happened.

262
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:49,892
The thing on my hand,
this--the sigil,

263
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:53,229
it appeared when I was dreaming,
of "Fillory."

264
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,065
Okay.

265
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:59,735
In my dream,
the sigil on my hand,

266
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,338
it--it came from Jane.

267
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,241
Chatwin. From "Fillory."

268
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,276
Look, honestly, Quentin,

269
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,710
growing up, the last thing
I wanted to do

270
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,145
was read fantasy.

271
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,052
Okay.
What if, um...

272
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,054
what if "Fillory" is real?

273
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,789
And I know that you think that
this is just about Charlie,

274
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,757
but I think--
I think maybe it's bigger,

275
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,326
because what came through
that mirror instead of Charlie,

276
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:29,029
it didn't exactly grow up
in the neighborhood.

277
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,765
Okay.

278
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,502
So what if it came
from, like, actual "Fillory"?

279
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:40,239
That's a leap, Quentin.

280
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,341
I mean, there are
other worlds out there,

281
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,676
but "Fillory" is just fiction.

282
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,947
Oh, no, the Chatwins,
they're real.

283
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,115
They lived next door
to the author.

284
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,616
He based the characters on them.

285
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,585
Jesus, how do you not know
any of this?

286
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,821
Is there someplace on campus
we can to go to watch a video?

287
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,026
- Yeah.
- Good.

288
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,162
<i>After living next door</i>

289
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,863
<i>to the Chatwins for years</i>

290
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,999
<i>and writing stories</i>
<i>for young Jane and Martin,</i>

291
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,534
<i>when Martin Chatwin disappeared,</i>

292
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,469
<i>Christopher Plover</i>
<i>was devastated.</i>

293
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,670
This was just one of a series
<i>of painful events</i>

294
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:15,806
<i>that haunted Christopher Plover.</i>

295
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,209
<i>It suffused his work with</i>
<i>a sense of melancholy and loss,</i>

296
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,478
<i>And the mystery of</i>
<i>Martin Chatwin's disappearance</i>

297
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:22,879
<i>was never solved.</i>

298
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,781
<i>Even more mysterious,</i>

299
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:27,985
<i>Martin's sister Jane</i>
<i>disappeared the following year.</i>

300
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,386
That's a lot of disappearing.

301
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,742
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of why

302
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,355
people are obsessed
with the books,

303
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,057
'cause you have these kids
walking into clocks,

304
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,858
into other worlds,
and they're based on real kids,

305
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:38,061
and the real kids, uh, vanished.

306
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,795
You're saying
that Charlie vanished too--

307
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,464
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't--I don't know--

308
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,066
I don't know what happened
to Charlie or anyone.

309
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,401
I just--
I don't know.

310
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:49,704
I mean look, we called
something from another world.

311
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:52,341
I don't know, can that
really be a coincidence?

312
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,143
So what do we do?

313
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,912
Don't get caught.
I can't get kicked out.

314
00:16:57,947 --> 00:16:59,214
I mean, I have to find out
what happened to him.

315
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:02,250
Yeah, I know, but...

316
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,818
what if "Fillory" is real?

317
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,687
Ah, Jesus, you don't understand

318
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,189
how mind-blowing that is.
It's just like--

319
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,823
Do you want to stay at Brakebills?

320
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,859
- Yes.
- Okay, so do I.

321
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,031
So let's just hide the evidence
and get our story straight.

322
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,300
Okay?

323
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:44,456
What, you're leaving?

324
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,392
- I'm gone.
- Come on.

325
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:49,728
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

326
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,930
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

327
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,733
You want the truth?
No sweat.

328
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,335
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

329
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,770
Couple lines, right mix of meds.

330
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,406
But you hurt Quentin and Alice
in the lab.

331
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
No, I didn't.

332
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:06,411
There's this voice.

333
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:07,912
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

334
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:12,016
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

335
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,317
Says he's a Magician.
That's--

336
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,319
That's all that I know
about him.

337
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,689
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

338
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,591
Holy shit.

339
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,794
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly nonstop fun growing up.

340
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,530
That's why I love that voice.

341
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:31,534
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

342
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,036
Yeah, right up until
he sent me to a lab to help,

343
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,373
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

344
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,840
You were hearing The Beast?

345
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,342
I was getting duped.

346
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,546
But, do they know?
I mean, Sunderland, anyone?

347
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,681
No, there's no point now.

348
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:48,950
But don't--
Penny, don't go.

349
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,819
Come on.
It's not your fault.

350
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:53,688
He tricked you.

351
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,123
Come on, don't be stupid.

352
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:57,492
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

353
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:59,360
that might actually
be able to help you with this?

354
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:00,661
Why do you care?

355
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:04,131
Look, I did the spell too,
Penny.

356
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:06,166
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

357
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:08,802
You're guilty.

358
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,137
Okay, great,
let's jump off a bridge.

359
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,172
Kady.

360
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:21,514
I can't stand it.

361
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:24,383
Okay.

362
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:28,087
Go.

363
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:30,423
But...

364
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:33,407
hey, since you're out anyway,

365
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:38,130
come do something stupid with me
before you go.

366
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,799
Come on.

367
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,135
Yeah cuz uh crushed
rocks you see that in spells

368
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,638
a concentrated area of effect.

369
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,173
I'm sorry, you knew this and
you didn't want to say anything?

370
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,008
Okay, well,
I don't know what I know.

371
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,378
Years reading Internet crap

372
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,613
and accidentally poisoning
myself twice,

373
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,048
and now I'm stuck
in a freezer with some bitch.

374
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:04,388
Well, you are.

375
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,024
What, did you figure
you wanted magic

376
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,692
at your blow dry last week?

377
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:09,226
This is serious for some of us.

378
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:10,995
Okay, you know what?
I'm not interested

379
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:11,996
in your personal issues.

380
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,232
Hey.

381
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:17,902
Wait, there was sand
in that paint can.

382
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:22,639
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
a knife and a bowl.

383
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,575
Okay.

384
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:26,409
And...

385
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:30,513
<i>"Graisse de l'animal--</i>
<i>de préférence de mouton."</i>

386
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,482
Animal fat.
Mutton.

387
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:33,951
Maybe there's meat?

388
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,821
Come on, let's go
before we freeze our tits off.

389
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:42,157
Whew.

390
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,061
This isn't just some lark to me,
so you know.

391
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:49,398
No offense, okay, you just
smell a little Ivy League to me.

392
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,267
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

393
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,368
I was.
Have you ever--

394
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,037
have you ever heard
of Brakebills?

395
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,371
No.

396
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:58,907
Well, it's like--

397
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,742
it's like this secret Yale,
but for magic.

398
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:02,443
What?

399
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:03,444
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

400
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:04,913
Well, I can do magic.

401
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,415
Yeah, so can I.

402
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:10,051
And yet, somehow, I flunked
the entrance exam.

403
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,185
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

404
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,256
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

405
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,291
I mean, seriously,
what do they expect, you know?

406
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,193
Magic is real
and that's the thing,

407
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,461
and once you know that,
you can't--

408
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:24,564
Nothing else matters.

409
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,399
Exactly.

410
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:29,268
It's like...

411
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,704
I know it's there.

412
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:35,307
It's everywhere, all around me,

413
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,779
a whole world
of power and beauty.

414
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,950
You can't unsee it.

415
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:47,552
You wake up for the first time.

416
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,788
Yeah.

417
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,925
Who are we kidding?

418
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:57,829
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

419
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:10,107
No, no way, I cannot do that.

420
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:13,144
Mm-mmm.
No, please do that.

00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:09,663
Yo, this one looks bunk.

433
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:11,898
Well, it's not.
It's Emerson's Alloy.

434
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,801
Uh, alloy's rusting.

435
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:16,002
How do you know?

436
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:18,739
'Cause I know things.

437
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:23,409
Like this place--
What? It's a gold mine.

438
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:27,379
Look, you can't run away
from you.

439
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:29,314
And, well, I'm here,
and I'm amazing,

440
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,651
so I mean--

441
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:35,520
I'll take it
under advisement, okay?

442
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:37,156
Hey.

443
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:38,824
No, leave us alone.

444
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:40,726
Gladly, we just--
we've got to discuss, um--

445
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:43,762
There you are, Quentin and Alice,

446
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:45,830
and Penny and Kady.

447
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:49,033
You're exactly
who I was looking for.

448
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:51,836
I found
the most interesting thing

449
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:53,872
buried in our woods.

450
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:58,442
Follow me.

451
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:09,753
We never
got near the mirror, I swear.

452
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:12,289
We were studying, that's all.

453
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,893
What language even is this?

454
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:17,594
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

455
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,862
We all touched it.
I mean, I touched--

456
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:22,731
We were studying, so--

457
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:25,802
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

458
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:27,703
There's residue
all over this book,

459
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:30,072
including a summoning

460
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:32,175
we believe opened the door
to The Beast.

461
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,078
What did you say?

462
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,947
Nothing, I--

463
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:50,558
Don't look at me.

464
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:54,962
Look, I know
they're your friends.

465
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:58,632
Okay, at this point,
I just have to assume

466
00:24:58,634 --> 00:24:59,633
it was all of you.

467
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,668
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

468
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,439
Shut up and I'll tell you,
happily.

469
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:12,345
It's fine, let's go.

470
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:13,612
You're welcome, by the way.

471
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,819
What does that mean?

472
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,958
Quentin, can I see you, please?

473
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,459
Alice, you're free to go.

474
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,363
There's nothing
I can do in this moment

475
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,566
to stop the comet from crashing
into the earth, is there?

476
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:40,923
Hold on.

477
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:42,892
Uh, what is this?

478
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:44,693
My books.
I'm headed to return them.

479
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:46,074
You've heard, I assume.

480
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,264
Word travels fast
when you're life's over.

481
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,732
Don't say that.

482
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:53,668
They're bringing in
a Specialist.

483
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,770
Yeah, thanks.
Ominous.

484
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,205
I'm sorry.

485
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,708
I don't know,
I keep trying to tell myself

486
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,713
this is somehow better,
you know, not to know.

487
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:08,715
'Cause who would want to know
that--that magic exists

488
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,251
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

489
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:12,086
if there's no one to teach you
or help you.

490
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,588
I...don't know
what to say.

491
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,358
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

492
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,461
You don't see color
and want to go black and white.

493
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:24,630
You do not have to make me
feel better, we--

494
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,899
really, we basically
just met each other.

495
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:30,937
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

496
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:34,441
Look, don't go out there
and be the old you.

497
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:36,076
How, Eliot?

498
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,878
I go back there, and I'm...

499
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,713
I'm a depressed super nerd.

500
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:43,782
How about I find you,
and I don't say magic is real,

501
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:46,751
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

502
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:50,922
that life retains
its sparkle for decades.

503
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:52,891
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Thank you.

504
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:54,926
Okay.

505
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,663
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

506
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,432
I don't know.

507
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:04,335
I've heard of the Specialist,
and all I can say is,

508
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:05,836
I hear they're very good.

509
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:20,783
<i>This is Julia, little busy.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

510
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:23,920
Hey, it's Q.

511
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:27,524
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>when we last met that--</i>

512
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:29,792
<i>I'm sorry, Jules.</i>
<i>I am.</i>

513
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:33,695
<i>I didn't know it,</i>
<i>what it must be like for you,</i>

514
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:39,101
<i>and I-I, um, I hope that</i>
<i>you are doing better.</i>

515
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:42,271
Oh, my God,
you're just going for it.

516
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,040
Ugh.

517
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,976
Um, so I got expelled and they
are sending in a Specialist

518
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:55,016
because the local brain wipe guy
is dead and--long story. Um--

519
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:59,554
So if you remember
or you figured out

520
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:01,989
why it didn't work on you,
I'd like to know that about now

521
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:06,027
because I need you to remind me
<i>that magic is real.</i>

522
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,866
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

523
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,669
You know,
without Brakebills, it's just,

524
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:17,937
I'm lost and you're not.

525
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:21,007
Magic, oh ho.

526
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,909
Okay.

527
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,910
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

528
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,048
You can't help
and I can't help you,

529
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,716
and it's just--

530
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:33,686
<i>To send your message, press one.</i>

531
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:37,990
<i>To erase, press two.</i>

532
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:42,727
<i>Deleted.</i>

533
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,467
Hey!

534
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:54,806
Ho, ho, ho,
you little piece of shit.

535
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,043
- You ratted me out.
- I told the truth.

536
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:01,579
- Not all of it.
- Oh, am I a fool?

537
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:03,214
Apparently not.

538
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:06,116
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

539
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:35,410
What the hell was that,
you maniac?

540
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:37,246
Hey!
Step back, both of you!

541
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:38,247
Who shot off that spell?

542
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:42,083
- He did!
- I did.

543
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:45,120
Infirmary, both of you, now.

544
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,994
Figured it out.

545
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:56,464
The spell, or, you know,
the whole point,

546
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:59,066
that there isn't one--
not to get out of the room,

547
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:01,902
not to
keep the door locked, nada.

548
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:03,471
Cute, Pete.

549
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,838
Oh, and scissors make
a shitty screw driver,

550
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,875
by the way.

551
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,150
Good for you.

552
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:19,352
Now you get why
it was so important.

553
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:21,254
To almost die for no reason?

554
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:22,321
To figure out
that not everything

555
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,623
gets solved by magic.

556
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,625
Key fact if you want
to last the month.

557
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:27,826
You're not still debating

558
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:28,994
letting me into your club,
are you?

559
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,029
Hey, I invited you.

560
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,265
No, you attacked me in a bar,

561
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,033
in the bathroom, on my birthday.

562
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,669
I'm done trying
to prove myself to you.

563
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:39,470
You weren't.

564
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:42,507
You were trying
to prove yourself to me.

565
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,013
That means level 50.

566
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,784
Um...

567
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:56,053
Uh, wait,
s-so you were--

568
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,955
Top bitch in New York, for starters.

569
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,691
Um, and this was--

570
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,327
Me discovering how much I like you.

571
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,995
You are smart.
You're passionate.

572
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,163
You question things.

573
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,465
You messed with my head!

574
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,999
Think about how much you learned

575
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,802
about how to do that
for when you're level 50.

576
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,670
- Hey, don't be mad.
- Don't be mad.

577
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,505
How am I supposed to trust you?

578
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,508
Why would you ever trust anyone?

579
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,909
I am willing to teach
the right people

580
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:25,648
everything I know,
and I know a lot,

581
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,184
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

582
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:32,920
just like, for instance,
Brakebills.

583
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,024
Brakebills.

584
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:38,192
You want a drink?

585
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:40,228
Let's get a drink.

586
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:48,463
Might burn a little.

587
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:49,621
This is why you're not
supposed to throw

588
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,757
this kind of magic around.

589
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,792
If you're lucky I can fix this.

590
00:31:53,794 --> 00:31:55,261
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

591
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:56,695
Yeah, so lucky.

592
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:06,204
Ooh.
That's actually--

593
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:09,507
Hold still, please.

594
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,180
- Pussy.
- Nobody asked you.

595
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:18,883
Me, the guy
you threw battle magic at?

596
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:20,651
Hey, have you heard of karma?

597
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:23,120
Well, sometimes it's instant.

598
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:24,821
You're welcome.

599
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:27,457
What is that?
How--how did you--

600
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,859
Real Magicians protect themselves.

601
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,495
Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

602
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:38,635
<i>She's late.</i>

603
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:40,136
<i>She's coming.</i>

604
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:43,072
<i>Or she's just</i>
<i>done with your shit.</i>

605
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:46,108
She doesn't have the option.

606
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:52,048
Finally.

607
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:55,351
Hey, look,
that thing you wanted,

608
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:57,518
that charm or crystal
or whatever?

609
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,988
The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?

610
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,158
Yeah, this guy I was with,
he grabbed it.

611
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,660
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

612
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:07,329
And more.

613
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:09,530
Here.

614
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:10,898
There's a ton
of good shit in there.

615
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,500
Hmm, listen to all that
backpedaling.

616
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:15,602
I'll get it, okay?

617
00:33:15,604 --> 00:33:19,073
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

618
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:21,775
Great.
You're a sweet girl, Kady.

619
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:23,577
You're a heartless bitch.

620
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:26,746
I'm generous with you,
considering.

621
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,452
Get me everything on this list,
this week.

622
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,921
Thanks so much.

623
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:37,423
You better get back to bed, hon.

624
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,905
I'm sure you got class
in the morning.

625
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,664
- Hi.
- Oh.

626
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:24,567
Caught me where I'm not
meant to be, a terminal snooper.

627
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:28,738
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

628
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,075
You--you were--you were there
the day of the alumni interview.

629
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:34,110
I--
You were a paramedic.

630
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,778
Call me Eliza.

631
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,581
I was there that day
to make sure that you got here.

632
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,150
Oh.

633
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:47,156
Well, uh, thank you,
but I kind of screwed that up.

634
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:48,657
Um...

635
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,426
They're calling in a Specialist.

636
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:54,563
He's supposed to wipe it all
away like it never happened.

637
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:59,833
That sounds--
Hmm.

638
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:04,772
You know, I'm the Specialist?
Sorry.

639
00:35:04,774 --> 00:35:06,674
Shall we sit?

640
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:12,446
Okay.
Okay.

641
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:15,014
Okay.

642
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:18,818
Um, just before,
um, can I--

643
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,520
Why did you give me that book?

644
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,057
"Fillory and Further," book six.

645
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:25,992
I thought you'd appreciate it.

646
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:27,026
I lost it.

647
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:28,128
Guess I was wrong.

648
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,196
No, you're not, I--

649
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:32,898
I need to read it.
I just, I can't find it.

650
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,501
Things with "Fillory"
are funny that way.

651
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:39,171
Is "Fillory" real?

652
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:42,674
Why even ask if you'll just
forget it again?

653
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:45,511
The books,
they're just--

654
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:48,513
They always felt
realer than anything.

655
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,981
Then it's real.

656
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,849
That's not a real answer.

657
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,218
Shall we begin?

658
00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:00,225
Okay, do it.

659
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:03,860
Oh, Quentin, I am pleased!

660
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,662
What?
Why?

661
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,266
You're a much better liar
than I expected you to be.

662
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,834
Can I level with you?

663
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,069
I wish you would.

664
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:16,273
You're not very remarkable.

665
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,409
You're smart, but no genius.

666
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,612
You do magic,
but nothing special.

667
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,281
And the worst is,
you're so eager to belong,

668
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,882
you even forget why you're here.

669
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,317
Why am I here?

670
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,892
You dreamed of it, didn't you,

671
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:42,531
"Fillory," before the attack,
like a warning?

672
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,466
Yeah, did you--
how did you?

673
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,134
Because I've dreamed of it too.

674
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:51,906
And I've looked
into that Beast's eyes.

675
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:53,608
What?

676
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,943
Do you think you have a destiny?

677
00:36:56,945 --> 00:36:58,379
Um, yes.

678
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:00,013
Yeah.

679
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:03,250
I used to believe that crap too
when I was young.

680
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:08,422
There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

681
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:09,923
I can't tell you why--

682
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:12,625
why The Beast came
sniffing for you.

683
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:15,695
There's no reason
it should be you.

684
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:18,665
You can either step up to it
or not, it's up to you.

685
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,801
We'll just hope for the best.

686
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:23,369
Who are you?

687
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,971
Just another inadequate Magician

688
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:28,940
who's lost people.

689
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,843
So will you if you don't
get strong.

690
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:35,847
Learn fast, any means necessary.

691
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,882
Which is why I'm so pleased
to see you sitting there

692
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:40,219
like you don't have
an Emerson's in your pocket

693
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:42,454
to repel any spell
to wipe your mind.

694
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:43,822
You stole that.

695
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,323
Who stole it?

696
00:37:46,825 --> 00:37:50,060
Relax, nobody's taking
your mind today.

697
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,296
We'll make something of you yet.

698
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:55,566
I'll tell the school
one more chance, probation.

699
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:58,502
They'll respect my call.

700
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:01,472
Don't make me regret it.

701
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:03,240
Don't hop back
on the garden path

702
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,308
like some little lemming,

703
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,677
or I'll erase everything
and start you over entirely,

704
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,145
for your own good.

705
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:10,980
The garden path?

706
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:14,618
Everything's connected.
Don't over-think it.

707
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,846
Congratulations, Julia.
Big day.

708
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:49,330
First star.
First of many.

709
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:50,765
Yeah.

710
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:57,705
This is just the beginning.

711
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:03,843
<i>♪ And, and you said</i>
<i>they wouldn't ♪</i>

712
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:07,847
<i>♪ Have to drive too far</i>

713
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,996
Hope your bits are covered.

714
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,032
Coming in.

715
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:40,044
How are you, Henry?

716
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,953
I'm sorry.

717
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,024
I knew he'd come, but I swear
I didn't know so soon.

718
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,559
No one is ready.

719
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:59,062
We need more time,

720
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,965
and a teacher with full use
of his hands.

721
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,034
There's that new wrinkle.

722
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,604
I'll find a way to help you.

723
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:10,374
We'll heal your hands
and your eyes.

724
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,942
It wouldn't help us.
It wouldn't help them, would it?

725
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:15,978
This is all my fault.

726
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,481
This is your problem,

727
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,783
that you should solve!

728
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:25,121
Quentin, Penny, they're not
built for this.

729
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:27,123
I know, and I've tried.

730
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,390
Go back there.

731
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:30,259
You say that
like I could hop a bus.

732
00:40:30,293 --> 00:40:32,327
Find a way back.

733
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:35,063
Find The Beast.
Kill him.

734
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:36,498
If I could manage that,

735
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:38,066
we'd be sharing a drink
right now,

736
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,471
not a care in the world
and four good eyes between us.

737
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:44,506
I'm sorry.

738
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,408
Just tell me what else I can do.

739
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:53,414
All we can do is
make them Magicians.

740
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:56,717
- That's not enough.
- I know.

741
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,628
Gonna just keep this BBQ
poppin', my love.

742
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:12,766
Oh, man.

743
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:18,204
Ha ha!

744
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:20,272
Quentin!

745
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:22,140
- Get over here.
- Quentin.

746
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:23,676
- Come on!
- Come on!

747
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,679
<i>Join the party, sad sack.</i>
<i>Hurry up.</i>

748
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:28,514
<i>- Mm.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God,</i>

749
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,316
<i>it's not like we have all day.</i>

750
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,383
<i>We're so drunk.</i>

751
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:32,618
<i>Okay, we have all day.</i>

752
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:37,917
