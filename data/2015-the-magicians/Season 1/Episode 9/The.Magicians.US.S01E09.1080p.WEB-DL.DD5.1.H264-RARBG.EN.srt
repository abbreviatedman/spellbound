1
00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:02,323
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,357 --> 00:00:03,643
<i>It is the beast, isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,026
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

4
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:06,532
You want to know
what the beast wants?

5
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:08,938
He wants control of Fillory and
all the doors that lead there.

6
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:10,364
<i>I gave you a book about it.</i>

7
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:13,087
<i>Stuff they're saying I did,
I don't remember.</i>

8
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:15,141
Were you blacked out
when we met?

9
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:17,677
We need something
or someone to lean on

10
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,379
<i>that is bigger than ourselves.</i>

11
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:21,014
<i>- What was that?
- Did it work?</i>

12
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:22,715
It was more energy
than I've ever felt.

13
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,353
Still the same, determined,
little Jane Chatwin.

14
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,694
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

15
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:36,896
She's the only one who could
actually give me answers.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,731
There are no answers,

17
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:43,002
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

18
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:49,008
<i>Dear Q.,</i>

19
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:51,878
<i>I don't need to tell you
how pissed at you I am.</i>

20
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,546
<i>Probably got the message
around the time</i>

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,548
<i>I incepted the shit out of you.</i>

22
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:57,750
<i>I don't understand
why we fell apart</i>

23
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,886
<i>after being friends forever.</i>

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,156
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part.</i>

25
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>I never meant
to really hurt you.</i>

26
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:08,528
<i>I put it down. I got help.</i>

27
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:09,842
<i>I know you're not
supposed to say</i>

28
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:11,531
<i>the other person fucked up too,</i>

29
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:14,500
<i>but you fucked up too,</i>

30
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:17,103
<i>and it broke us,
and I hate you for that,</i>

31
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:19,172
<i>because I really miss us, Q.</i>

32
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,208
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

33
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:23,343
<i>Jules.</i>

34
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:26,446
<i>J., got your letter.</i>

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,614
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

36
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:32,585
<i>But I'm glad you're okay.
I really am.</i>

37
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,454
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

38
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:42,061
<i>It's not black and white, Julia.</i>

39
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:44,430
It's all I thought about

40
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,299
all day when I was in there,

41
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,868
and it's all that I think about
now that I'm out.

42
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:53,706
Well, there's this sometimes
very handy thing called penance.

43
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:57,310
What, like 50 magic lashes?

44
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:59,979
That spell you used to get
inside your friend's mind,

45
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,881
do you remember it?

46
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,449
That's a perfect example

47
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:06,986
of something that can be used
to help instead of hurt.

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,654
If you're not afraid
to do the work...

49
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:11,090
I'm not.

50
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,292
Okay.

51
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,898
Q.?

52
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,433
You can't sleep?

53
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:24,237
I just, uh...

54
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,806
Eliza gave me the answer,

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,307
apparently, and I lost it.

56
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:30,076
"Fillory and Further, Book Six."

57
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,413
And it was important,
and it just vanished.

58
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:36,282
So did you look for it?

59
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,684
Yeah, of course. Everywhere. I...

60
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:45,291
Fillory is always deciding

61
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,460
when to let the Chatwins go

62
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:50,663
and deciding
when to kick them out,

63
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:52,198
because Ember and Umber...

64
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:53,833
Right, the twin gods of Fillory.

65
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,768
They get mean and
take everything away, I know.

66
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,337
Essentially, yeah.

67
00:02:58,372 --> 00:03:01,207
They have their reasons.

68
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,709
But that's what happened
to the manuscript.

69
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,711
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

70
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:08,514
It's a manuscript,
not a referendum on your character.

71
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:10,149
No. I...

72
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:11,617
- In the books...
- So you lost it.

73
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:13,219
What do you do
when you lose something?

74
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,145
So you had it the whole time.

75
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,180
I don't know what you're
yapping about, as usual.

76
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,882
"Book Six."

77
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,184
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

78
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,986
Like I said, it wasn't me.

79
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,691
Want to get that thing
out of my face?

80
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:56,262
Ugh, fine.
I took the stupid thing.

81
00:03:56,296 --> 00:04:00,199
I was bored. It was there.

82
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,567
Now it's gone.

83
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,169
Gone?
What do you mean, it's gone?

84
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,437
I mean I read it.

85
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:05,771
I spilled my beer on it.

86
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,273
I tossed it in the trash,

87
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,941
and then I went
and got another beer.

88
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,744
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

89
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,045
Wait. You said you read it.

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,549
- Do you... do you remember it?
- Ish.

91
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,384
This is important.
Okay, I need you...

92
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,086
I need to punch you
in the throat

93
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,787
if you tell me
what I need to do.

94
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:23,623
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

95
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,358
You've got the scars
to prove it.

96
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,593
I don't understand why
we can't just be basic allies.

97
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:30,363
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

98
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,064
more than you want to live. I...

99
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:37,036
What did Plover say in the book?
Come on.

100
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,207
First of all,
what's-his-name didn't write it.

101
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:44,610
Plover. Christopher Plover.

102
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:46,445
The girl did.

103
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Jane Chatwin.

104
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:51,817
Wrote "Book Six"? Holy shit.

105
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:53,119
<i>Yeah, she started off by saying</i>

106
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:54,820
<i>that the other books are wrong</i>

107
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,656
<i>and she wanted to go back
and clarify some shit.</i>

108
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,257
Wrong in what way?

109
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,893
Um, this... this was
the summer that the mom died,

110
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:04,163
and they were hanging out
in Plover's mansion,

111
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:05,565
eating crumpets.

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,668
Right. Um...

113
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,970
<i>Jane and Martin opened a closet,</i>

114
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,271
<i>and they went to Fillory.</i>

115
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:15,007
No. Martin didn't go.

116
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,310
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

117
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:19,145
- Forgetting him?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:20,446
Martin was crying
like a little bitch

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,148
about Fillory
not wanting him anymore,

120
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:25,284
and Jane said hang tight
and she'll find some way

121
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,920
that Martin can go back
to Fillory anytime he wanted.

122
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,855
<i>Yeah, and there were,
like, creatures or something.</i>

123
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,324
<i>Questing Creature...
if you catch one,</i>

124
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,092
they're forced
to grant you a wish.

125
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,760
There's seven of them.
There's a dog, a rabbit...

126
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,629
Stop!

127
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:39,131
I'm literally becoming less cool
with every word you speak.

128
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,867
<i>So I assume she had
her enchanted bow</i>

129
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:43,669
so that she could
actually get one.

130
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:45,538
Uh...

131
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,373
Yes, right. Yes.

132
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,444
Stop, or I'll shoot.

133
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,279
Hello, human child.

134
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,348
<i>It was a dog.</i>

135
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:57,817
I need a key
to unlock the door to Fillory.

136
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,986
- I caught you, dog.
<i>- No, wait.</i>

137
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,954
Not a dog.

138
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,055
It was a pig.

139
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,991
By decree of Ember and Umber,

140
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,525
you must give me what I ask.

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,561
Wrong. No. What was it?

142
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,229
- Back up.
- Ah, for fuck sake.

143
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,797
Hello, human child.

144
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,332
I caught you.

145
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:14,667
Give me what I ask.

146
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:15,868
Did it work?

147
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:18,804
As you wish, so shall it be.

148
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:27,079
Wait. So the button is the key?

149
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:30,216
- Well, this all makes sense.
- It does?

150
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,751
In the last book, Martin...

151
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,519
he's obsessed with finding
the lost button.

152
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:35,254
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

153
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:39,191
The message boards are insane,
um, with different theories,

154
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:41,327
because the books... they just say
that the button's magic.

155
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:44,196
They don't... they don't...
nothing specific about it.

156
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:47,733
- Oh, this is huge.
- Why is this huge?

157
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:50,736
Because it could still
be there at Plover's house.

158
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,905
Martin never found it.
We could...

159
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,776
Whoa, you are talking about
a direct ticket to the fucking Beast.

160
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,577
Better than him
having one to us.

161
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:01,380
Look, this is in a manuscript
that you're probably

162
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:04,450
the only person
to have ever read.

163
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:06,352
There's a chance
the button's still there.

164
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,388
I'm going,

165
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,424
and like it or not,
Penny, you should come.

166
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,961
I'm coming too.

167
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,897
Okay.

168
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,366
So what's the quickest way
to England?

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,368
Ooh, Penny, do you...

170
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,370
Dick.

171
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:38,951
Great. I'll... I'll pack.

172
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:40,252
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

173
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,822
- To where?
- Uh...

174
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,590
Scurry along, Ronald.

175
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,825
Raymond.

176
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:48,794
Raymond. Have a great day.

177
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,937
Uh... So you seem good.

178
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,638
Could use a top-up.

179
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,510
So where are you
flying off to, exactly?

180
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,246
Uh, England.

181
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,615
Oh, you don't need a plane.

182
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,151
Margo and I made a door directly
to our favorite pub.

183
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:14,320
You can get to where
you need to go from there.

184
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:16,122
I'll show you if you take me.

185
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,823
Margo's still in Ibiza.

186
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,525
Ronald gives terrible head.

187
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,794
It's not his fault. TMJ.

188
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,530
I'm bored.

189
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,432
- You don't even know what...
- I'll catch up.

190
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:41,947
How are you today, Keira?
I brought a friend.

191
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:46,986
I've been working on
that thing we talked about.

192
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,956
Julia's here to help.
You want to lock the door?

193
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,892
Yeah.

194
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:57,630
Keira, I want you to think
of somewhere that you love.

195
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:02,201
We're going to create that place
together in your mind.

196
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:04,003
She can hear us, right?

197
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,740
Julia's gonna meet you there.

198
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:11,877
She's experienced
in mental projection.

199
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:14,146
I wouldn't call it a specialty.

200
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:17,383
If anything goes pear-shaped,
I'll pull you right back.

201
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:53,953
Richard?

202
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,622
Keira?

203
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,490
Hello?

204
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:02,461
Richard, I'm stuck!
Someone get me out of here!

205
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:05,112
We screwed up.

206
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,489
We screwed up.

207
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,850
Someone saw "Kill Bill."

208
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,358
Keira, Keira,

209
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:25,860
if you don't want me in here,
then just let me go.

210
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,564
I know shit Uma didn't know...

211
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,567
Like how to become
impervious to fire,

212
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:34,536
so I will walk
right out of here.

213
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:57,058
Are you Richard's friend?

214
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,626
What the hell was that?

215
00:10:58,661 --> 00:10:59,981
Needed to see
if you were any good

216
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:01,396
before I let you near me.

217
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,032
What is it with Magicians
and tests?

218
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,035
Here. You need a pen.

219
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,804
Did Richard tell you who I am?

220
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,540
Just that you're
extremely smart.

221
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,946
I can barely comprehend this.

222
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,048
Can you tell it doesn't work?

223
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:22,550
There was an answer.
I could feel it.

224
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:26,087
I couldn't get there.
Then my body turned on me.

225
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:30,558
- How long have you...
- Year.

226
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,627
But I still have this.

227
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:36,431
So I sat and did the rest of it.

228
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:39,300
You finished this in your mind?

229
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,603
I talk. You write.

230
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:43,605
And when you go back out,
remember what you wrote.

231
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,273
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:47,108
Um...

233
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,410
Fire at will.

234
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,948
Okay. So we start pretty simply.

235
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,850
The framework from Popper 45.

236
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,085
Okay.

237
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:05,427
<i>This estate has been
in the Plover family</i>

238
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,162
<i>for five generations.</i>

239
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:10,598
Christopher Plover,
already a prolific and respected author,

240
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,767
was looking for inspiration
for his new book

241
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:15,370
when Jane Martin
and Rupert Chatwin

242
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:16,871
moved in next door.

243
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:18,673
- Not exactly.
- Excuse me?

244
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:20,708
Question from the back.

245
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:25,213
No, not a question,
more of a correction.

246
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:27,882
The kids got there first,
Jane and Martin,

247
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,819
and then Rupert got injured.

248
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,288
Ah, we have ourselves an expert.

249
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:35,490
- Now...
- And Plover's previous work,

250
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:37,659
uh, he... well,
he only got rejections for it.

251
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:39,160
It just didn't really
show the depth

252
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,895
of the "Fillory and Further"
series.

253
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,730
Stay closer.

254
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:45,533
I'm not sure I can
do this tour without you.

255
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:51,506
Now we have some pictures
of the Plover family.

256
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,576
Plover's sister Prudence

257
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,379
cared for him until
his untimely death in 1952.

258
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,248
Stay with the group, please.

259
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:02,317
Not all rooms
are for public viewing.

260
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,387
Prudence said Christopher
so understood children

261
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,756
because of his own
tragic childhood.

262
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,059
He aided many families
in the area

263
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,361
and paid for the education
of his housekeeper's children,

264
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,396
George and Beatrix.

265
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,933
Not only did he write
for the Chatwins,

266
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:21,336
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

267
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,906
Legend has it Jane
walked through a closet

268
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,409
in this very house
to get to Fillory.

269
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,945
Follow me to the writing room.

270
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:47,595
This is where Fillory was born,

271
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,598
where Plover told tales
to Jane and Martin.

272
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:54,102
As Plover wrote,
"There is no substitute

273
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,304
for a childhood of adventure,

274
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:59,774
warmth, and love."

275
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:02,443
You will never be a man.

276
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,813
All right,
let's find this button

277
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,448
and get out of here.

278
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:12,220
Shall we proceed,
criminal element?

279
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,798
This is where he wrote it,

280
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:26,234
right here.

281
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:30,939
This desk saved my life.

282
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,473
So I liked the books
when I was a kid,

283
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:33,841
and my friend Julia and I,

284
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:37,145
we'd pretend to be
Jane and Martin and...

285
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,447
So I was 16 the first time
I was hospitalized.

286
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,116
I just... I couldn't
get out of bed, like, at all.

287
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:43,585
I didn't know that.

288
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:47,021
My brain breaks sometimes.

289
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:49,290
And my dad brought me the books,
and I read them,

290
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:53,962
and I felt enough like me
to at least

291
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,164
try to get back in the game,
you know?

292
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,666
Do you still feel like that?

293
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,868
Broken brain?

294
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,804
I feel like...

295
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,272
I don't feel
that it really fixes.

296
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,374
It just works better now

297
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:10,545
in its own screwed up way.

298
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,781
Hey, would you break up
with me if I told you

299
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:16,017
that I've never been happier
in my entire life?

300
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:20,622
Guys, stop lovebirding and look.

301
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:42,210
Boring, boring...

302
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,679
- Completely boring.
- Hey, this could be something.

303
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:52,320
It's a letter
from Prudence, his sister,

304
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:53,921
to their lawyer.

305
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,657
Plover died
of a heart attack in 1952,

306
00:15:55,691 --> 00:16:00,595
but this is all about
how he's missing, not dead.

307
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,998
She wants a death
certificate issued.

308
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:07,235
Whoa.

309
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,403
Holy shit. They lied.

310
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:09,904
Why would she lie if the...

311
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,339
Rumors about Plover.

312
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,541
He... there are these kids
that were missing...

313
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:15,943
kids that knew Plover,

314
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,446
and in his absence,
people were talking,

315
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,082
and the longer that
they stayed vanished,

316
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:23,217
the more people started
connecting them in a bad way.

317
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:26,521
No, I bet it's more
complicated than that, right?

318
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:29,557
Well, because... because
Fillory is actually real.

319
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:33,294
Exactly, and Plover was crushed

320
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,862
that the Chatwins were missing,

321
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:36,597
because he knew exactly
where they went.

322
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,199
I love a good cover-up.

323
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,934
And the books
were already getting famous,

324
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:43,938
so maybe it was easier
just to say he died, I guess.

325
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:46,107
So what happened to him?

326
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:47,809
I got a theory.

327
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:52,547
McCabe, Livingston, Ali, Popper.

328
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,815
Oh, my God.

329
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,883
- He was studying magic.
- Yeah.

330
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,752
I guess that never made it
to the message boards.

331
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:58,886
But check this out.

332
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,622
Kaminsky, Umar,

333
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:03,458
Aurora.

334
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,259
I've never even heard of those.

335
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:06,794
Of course, you haven't.
You're not a traveler.

336
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,296
It's the entire 101.

337
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,465
- Plover was a traveler?
- Or he wanted to be.

338
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,633
I mean, you go one inch wrong,

339
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:13,901
you're torn to shreds.

340
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,169
This is amazing.

341
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:16,504
- What if...
- Try this.

342
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,673
Plover's an idiot, like you,

343
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:21,175
who wanted to go
to Fillory, like you,

344
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,246
so he tries a spell
and gets blown up.

345
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,450
Or it worked.

346
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:32,653
Fantastic to idiots.

347
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,592
You want some? It never empties.

348
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,523
Trapped here. Help us.

349
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:11,159
Trapped here. Help us.

350
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,326
- Alice...
- Shh.

351
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,295
Don't you hear that?

352
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,033
What in God's name
are you doing?

353
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,502
You set off the alarms. You have
to get out of here this instant.

354
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,871
Okay. Look.

355
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,040
Is this something that
can be fixed with money?

356
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:27,341
But you're not listening.

357
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:29,477
Are you mad, or are you scared?

358
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,579
You shouldn't be here at night,
so please...

359
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,214
What really happened to Plover?

360
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:34,482
I don't know what
you're talking about.

361
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,150
Yes, you do.

362
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:38,419
Ugh, he's so panicked,

363
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,555
I can't make sense
of anything he's thinking.

364
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,290
Okay. Enough of this.

365
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,695
I'm a super villain.

366
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,030
- Now talk.
- Okay.

367
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:50,565
But then we need to go.

368
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,001
Plover... what was
the real deal?

369
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,838
He was involved
in some dark things.

370
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,272
There's a book.
It's hidden in the writing room.

371
00:18:58,307 --> 00:18:59,457
Yeah. I think we found it.

372
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,342
Prudence... she didn't
want anyone to know

373
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:02,677
the unnatural things
that her brother...

374
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:05,413
Oh, no!

375
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:07,348
- Oh, my God.
- Where did they go?

376
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,727
Whoa.

377
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:24,699
Okay, then.

378
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,534
Let's get the fuck out of here.

379
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,636
All in favor?

380
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,055
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

381
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:43,426
Penny.

382
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,729
Alice and Eliot.

383
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:48,597
Fuck me.

384
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:57,043
So where did Richard find you?

385
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,111
Brakebills?

386
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:00,046
Rehab.

387
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,148
- Really?
- Yeah.

388
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:04,451
I, uh... didn't go
to school for this.

389
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,486
You sound bitter.

390
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,221
You caught that.

391
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:09,789
You know, I didn't
go to school either.

392
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:11,558
Come on.

393
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,293
Well, I went to MIT,

394
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:16,196
but I didn't study
a lick of magic in school.

395
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,633
- This is brilliant.
- Magic is science.

396
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,468
Hard to crack on your own,

397
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:24,037
but far from impossible,
if you have the natural bent.

398
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:27,173
Yeah.

399
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:31,044
You know, sometimes,
I wonder if I do...

400
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,879
have it naturally.

401
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:35,248
What if it's all
just one big party trick

402
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:36,523
that never adds up to anything?

403
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,887
So? What if it doesn't?

404
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:44,224
You know what I think
about when I'm in here?

405
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:49,696
This one day in this park
with my girlfriend.

406
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,097
We sat here in the rain

407
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,000
doing this dumb little spell
over and over,

408
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:57,604
making a rainbow
that lasted ten seconds.

409
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,940
Sounds lovely.

410
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:02,542
It was.

411
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:05,845
Best day of my life.

412
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,948
What's yours?

413
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,616
Here.

414
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,186
While you and Richard
are juicing me up, show me.

415
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,595
I was ten
with my friend Quentin.

416
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,932
No one bothered us under here.
It was like we were invisible.

417
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,701
We'd read "Fillory" books
for hours.

418
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:28,969
I loved those.

419
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,307
One day, we made this

420
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:36,376
like we were gonna go visit.

421
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:41,815
We were playing,
but it felt real.

422
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:46,052
See this.

423
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,054
Chase this.

424
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:52,926
It's the secret
to how to be you.

425
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,463
Okay. Back to the park.

426
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,565
Let's finish this puppy.

427
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,266
Alice?

428
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:04,137
Eliot?

429
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,605
- Alice!
- Chill, man.

430
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:06,973
They can handle themselves.

431
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:10,076
Shh, shh!

432
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,678
What the hell was that?

433
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,182
This house is haunted as balls,
is what that is.

434
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:19,452
Come in here, please.

435
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:31,831
Okay...

436
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,335
Hello?

437
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:38,505
Anyone or anything?

438
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:57,557
Okay, Jesus, we get it.

439
00:22:57,591 --> 00:22:59,726
There are ghosts in here.

440
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:02,662
I tag you.

441
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,631
You're it.

442
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:16,076
What just happened?

443
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,178
I tag you. You're it.

444
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,149
Do we go with this?

445
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:26,252
What other option do we have?

446
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:50,910
Okay, this is a little kinky,
even for me.

447
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:54,180
Would you care for refreshment?

448
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:59,119
Oh, um, okay, sure.
Sounds divine.

449
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:02,222
Mmm. Okay.

450
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,090
Thank you.

451
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,427
We must get these things
off our hands.

452
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,928
Do you know Popper 29 yet?

453
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,597
No magic in the house.

454
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:13,933
Be good, or she'll take you
to the quiet place.

455
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:17,704
We'll be good. Right, Eliot?

456
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:20,306
Mm, yeah, you're the boss, kid.

457
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,543
She's coming.

458
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:36,456
Stop doing that.

459
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:44,063
My brother is too soft,

460
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:48,468
caring for you when he
needs peace to work.

461
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:53,940
He has no idea
how naughty you truly are.

462
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:56,176
Now drink your tea.

463
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,787
Drink it.

464
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:24,837
No. I'm over here.

465
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:34,781
Holy shit,
that's Christopher Plover.

466
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:39,319
Is it just me,
or does it feel like

467
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:40,720
we're being shown something,
like how it was?

468
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:42,689
Yeah, the time slip.

469
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:44,457
You say that like,
"Yeah, a sunrise."

470
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,492
Sunderland talks
about it all the time.

471
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,061
She has a PhD in hauntings.

472
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,829
Her favorite thing
about a haunted house is,

473
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:52,365
you get these ghost movies
of the past running on a loop.

474
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,234
You see shit like it was.

475
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:55,535
I didn't know any of that.

476
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:56,869
Of course not. You're an idiot.

477
00:25:58,172 --> 00:25:59,806
Oh, my God, it's her.

478
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,541
It's a tiny chick in a beret.

479
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:03,643
Slow down, Jane.

480
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,745
That's Jane and Martin
from the books.

481
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,880
- Nerdgasm.
- This makes sense.

482
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:09,715
Plover took them in,
and they spent their days

483
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:11,251
playing with
the housekeeper's kids.

484
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:12,752
Martin... he was, like,
really sick that summer...

485
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:14,687
Martin, hurry!

486
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:17,857
Janey, wait for me.

487
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:20,159
Wait, no. I'm coming with you.

488
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:25,231
Why won't you take me?

489
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:28,668
Ember, Umber, why won't you
let me in anymore?

490
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:35,842
I try to be good.

491
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:39,545
Martin, are you all right?

492
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,880
Where's Jane?

493
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:42,849
Fillory.

494
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:45,051
What's wrong with me?

495
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,353
Nothing.

496
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:49,055
Some things just aren't fair.

497
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:50,757
We can't make sense of them.

498
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,392
Let's have tea, hmm? Come on.

499
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:55,461
Us left-behinds
ought to stick together.

500
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:03,936
She's coming. We need to hide.

501
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,538
Quentin?

502
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:10,476
Okay, I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

503
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,445
What did I tell you children

504
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,985
about disturbing Mr. Plover?

505
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,929
Great.

506
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:40,098
No talking in the quiet place.

507
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,440
Lady, I don't know
who you think I am, but...

508
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:45,337
Insolent is what you are.

509
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:49,941
I've told you I'll sew it shut.

510
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:53,345
Alice.

511
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:08,693
Hey, hey, we need to hustle.

512
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,595
Mrs. Danvers could come back.

513
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:12,097
Oh, my God.

514
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:13,765
Do you know what this is?

515
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,167
A vaguely whimsical horror show?

516
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,802
She did this.

517
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:19,671
She really did this to
the children... Plover's sister.

518
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:21,005
She tied them up
and drugged them

519
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,807
so that they wouldn't
disturb his work.

520
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:25,242
Okay, well, maybe ghost girl
can tell us where the button is.

521
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:26,644
Hey, Beatrix?

522
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,813
Beatrix, hey.

523
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:31,983
My tummy feels bad.

524
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:34,386
Beatrix, it's okay.

525
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:38,723
- How can we help her?
- I don't think we can.

526
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,998
Well, I guess we know
how she died.

527
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,867
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

528
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:51,469
It's okay. It's over.

529
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,871
It's been over for a long time.

530
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,339
No, no, no, no. Not for her.

531
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,040
She just keeps reliving it
over and over.

532
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,075
- We have to...
- We have to go.

533
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:00,011
We have to go.

534
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:01,546
It's not the same.

535
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,815
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

536
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,050
Here, have another.

537
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:08,820
Hmm.

538
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:12,056
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

539
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:14,592
Oh, shall we work a little?

540
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,929
I think that might be nice.

541
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:20,165
Do you think that might be nice?

542
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,335
Martin, Mr. Plover, I'm back.

543
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,703
I was in Fillory.

544
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:27,405
Martin, I brought you
what you asked for.

545
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,274
- You must have a look.
- We'll be right back, sir.

546
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:32,410
She's dragging mud
all over the floor.

547
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:38,082
Stop that. You're pinching me.

548
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:39,584
- You've got it?
- Yes.

549
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:40,618
Let's go show Mr. Plover.

550
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,054
No, please. Let's not.

551
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:44,422
For me.

552
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:45,957
The button's a key.

553
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:52,530
I know you're here.

554
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,098
I know you're spying on us.

555
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,568
George, come out.

556
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,141
Take this.

557
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,809
It's a game, George.

558
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,445
How well can you
hide the button?

559
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:15,053
All right.

560
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:17,422
Well, I...
I won't forget any of it, so...

561
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,491
I know you won't.

562
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,060
Can I give you a little
advice in return?

563
00:30:22,094 --> 00:30:24,929
- Yeah.
- Forget that school.

564
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:26,397
The world never did help
a smart girl.

565
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:27,899
Why would it?

566
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:31,169
We scare the shit
out of the world.

567
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:34,272
If the world goes after you,
take it as a compliment.

568
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,614
You know, I could come back.
We could... we could do more.

569
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:45,250
- This was really the big one.
- No, I know.

570
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:47,919
I just... I just... you know,
I'm sure you have more things...

571
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:49,420
I do need one other thing.

572
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:51,489
Yeah, sure. Anything.

573
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:54,993
Kill me.

574
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,961
That's... that's crazy.

575
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,697
I'm allowed to be done.

576
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:03,701
- No. I can't.
- Well, I need you to.

577
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,007
You knew.

578
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,642
You knew, and you did...

579
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:11,976
No, I did not sign up for this.

580
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,510
- Then what? Pleasantries?
- No, how about not killing anyone?

581
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:17,448
What do you think redemption
looks like, Julia?

582
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:19,817
Being nice?
Donating shoes to Africa?

583
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:23,555
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

584
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,290
What if she's wrong?

585
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:28,359
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

586
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:30,995
What if there really is a hell
and this takes me there?

587
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,631
You're already in hell.
So is she.

588
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:40,204
What am I supposed to do?

589
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,607
Whichever's hardest.

590
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:54,352
Oh, thank you.

591
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:57,522
Drink up, Jane, and eat.

592
00:31:57,556 --> 00:31:59,524
You must be famished.

593
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:14,038
Jane, don't you want to join us?

594
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:20,578
Oh, she's tired.

595
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,213
That's all right.

596
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:26,250
You go ahead, Martin,
like last time.

597
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:30,555
I don't know if I want to.

598
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,423
Remember when I took
you and your sister

599
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:35,193
to town for cinema?

600
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:37,028
Bought her that dress
she wanted.

601
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:38,296
Yes. We're grateful.

602
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,365
When I was a boy,

603
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,934
I didn't have anyone
who thought about me.

604
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:47,105
I saw it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

605
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,741
I care about you, Martin.

606
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:53,711
Come on, in front of the camera.

607
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:00,151
Give me a smile.

608
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,053
Mm.

609
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:04,255
Oh, I have the best news.

610
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:07,158
I am so close
to figuring it all out.

611
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:09,594
Wild magic,

612
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:12,430
too strong to do
with human hands.

613
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:13,965
I'd have to grow another finger.

614
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:17,335
Can you imagine?

615
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,137
Of course, there's
spellwork for that too,

616
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:20,772
if I can master it.

617
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:25,476
All right, you can go ahead
and take that off now.

618
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,730
Trousers too, darling.
All of it.

619
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,504
I think the solution
to all our problems

620
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:55,440
lies in Fillory.

621
00:33:55,474 --> 00:33:57,208
I need to go there with you.

622
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,676
- But...
- I know.

623
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:00,044
It's been for you kids.

624
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,047
But I think we could
find a way to go.

625
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:06,350
We could be together.

626
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:09,787
You're a lovely boy, Martin.

627
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:13,991
Now turn around.

628
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:20,832
They play like that
all the time.

629
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,667
A whole pile of naughty pictures

630
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:24,135
hidden in the dictionary.

631
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,370
Oh, no. The mean lady.

632
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,807
- Little spy!
- I didn't see anything!

633
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:31,309
- I swear.
- May God punish you.

634
00:34:31,343 --> 00:34:33,411
- My brother is a good man.
- No.

635
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:35,980
You all hound him.
It's your fault.

636
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:38,082
Stop. Leave him alone.

637
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:45,423
Hmm.

638
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:48,726
To the quiet place,

639
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:50,561
for the best.

640
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:14,295
- We should go back in there.
- Shh.

641
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:17,517
I'm trying to think,
and I'm out of cigarettes.

642
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,553
This is dire.

643
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:22,055
Oh, my God. You're okay.

644
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:24,758
We're great.
We're both great, actually.

645
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,326
Where's Penny?

646
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,996
Knowing him, Disneyland by now.

647
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:32,432
What if he got to Fillory?

648
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,367
What did he do to Martin?

649
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,269
What are you talking about?

650
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:43,243
I saw something in there...

651
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:44,878
who Plover really was,

652
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:47,914
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

653
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,551
What... was he doing?

654
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:55,922
Oh, God.

655
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:57,524
The poor kid, he was just trying

656
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:59,259
to get a button to Fillory,

657
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:02,062
you know, so he could escape
this monster, who, by the way,

658
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:04,698
generations of idiots like me
have been worshiping

659
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,033
like a literary god...

660
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,073
who was... learning magic

661
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:15,742
to get stronger, to travel,

662
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:20,046
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

663
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:22,082
Grow fingers? Like...

664
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:23,950
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

665
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:26,720
What if he went there
because he had access

666
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:29,322
via these kids who he liked
to tell stories to

667
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:33,560
when he wasn't drugging
and raping them?

668
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,329
Jesus.

669
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:40,433
Well, I still have
the capacity to be surprised.

670
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,802
We thought you ditched us.

671
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:45,272
What happened to you?

672
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:47,474
Man, I traveled into
a fuck tree about a mile off,

673
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:50,677
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

674
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:54,014
Not so precise
with the travel, huh?

675
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:55,482
Shut up.

676
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:57,417
Wait, what do you mean, dungeon?

677
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,785
I mean some dirt-floor basement

678
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,487
bitch calls the quiet place,

679
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,088
'cause that's not
fuck psychotic.

680
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:04,024
There's a storm cellar
around the back.

681
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,625
That's where she took
the housekeeper's kid.

682
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,760
He's got the button
in his pocket.

683
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:08,695
- Let's go.
- Whoa.

684
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,031
That's a great idea if you want
Prudence to grab us immediately.

685
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,299
- Dislike.
- Okay.

686
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,100
I know what to do about her.

687
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:17,704
Give me a ten-minute head start,
and then head to the cellar.

688
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,280
What are you doing
out of the playroom?

689
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:29,182
This is going well.

690
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,650
- Where the hell's Quentin?
- He's coming.

691
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:32,385
You're all going
to the quiet place.

692
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,287
Hey, Prudence!

693
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:36,323
I heard the nastiest rumor

694
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:39,826
about your brother.

695
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,495
Okay, fine, but there are
about 48 more of those

696
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,464
that I just hid
all over the house.

697
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:45,799
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows exactly

698
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,033
what Christopher Plover did.

699
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:49,135
No.

700
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,004
Okay.

701
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:53,974
Well, that bought us
about ten minutes.

702
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,642
Let's go dig up a dead body.

703
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:03,186
It's done.

704
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:05,625
Richard and I, we...

705
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:10,027
So this is what that's like.

706
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:12,058
Do you want me to stay?

707
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:13,760
So you're found
meditating in my room

708
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,882
next to my overdosed corpse?

709
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,769
Yeah, well,
when you put it like that...

710
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,581
Bye, Julia.

711
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,384
Have a good life.

712
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:46,165
We'd better go.

713
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,179
Quentin.

714
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:38,116
We have to go back.

715
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:40,219
- Come on.
- We have to go back, Quentin.

716
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,320
And do what, exactly?

717
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:43,689
Help those children.

718
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:47,359
You can't seriously be thinking
of leaving them there.

719
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:48,827
They were there
before we were born.

720
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,996
Trapped.

721
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,310
This is exactly
the kind of thing

722
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:54,466
that we should be able to fix.

723
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,568
There are ways
to clear a haunted house.

724
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,903
The house, yes.

725
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,671
It doesn't help with the ghosts.

726
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:02,007
There are rituals
in every civilization.

727
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:06,645
To prevent this, not reverse it.

728
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,013
We have to help them.

729
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:10,048
There has to be something.

730
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:12,484
Those kids... they did nothing.

731
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:14,219
That is so unfair.

732
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:16,521
- You don't say.
- You're not helping.

733
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:17,990
I'm the only one helping.

734
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:20,993
Life ain't fair.

735
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:23,996
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

736
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,731
Thinking that you can
change anything...

737
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:28,267
it's such an act
of monumental ego.

738
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,103
I mean, who the fuck
do you think you really are?

739
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,005
I mean, you're just some
arrogant, little twat.

740
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,641
- So suck it up.
- Shut the fuck up.

741
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:44,349
Vix,

742
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:48,253
if we're gonna go, we got to go.

743
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:50,622
Okay.

744
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,758
Come on.

745
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,449
Thanks, but I'm okay.

746
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:19,718
No, you're not.

747
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:21,420
Okay, I'm not.

748
00:41:22,822 --> 00:41:24,723
Are you okay?

749
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,727
No.

750
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:34,466
I've been freaked about The Beast
since that day, you know?

751
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,303
I've been worried about myself,

752
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:43,008
and now that we know
who he is, what he is,

753
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,312
what he did to those kids,
Martin, I just...

754
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:49,014
I want to kill him, you know?

755
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,649
I want to... I want to step
through the nearest clock,

756
00:41:50,683 --> 00:41:52,317
and I want to wring his neck.

757
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:54,419
Okay.

758
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:56,955
Let's see this button.

759
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:06,631
It looks so ordinary.

760
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:10,168
No, I feel something
coming off of it...

761
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:12,437
hard.

762
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:20,779
You guys really don't feel that?

763
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:21,975
Maybe you should put it away.

764
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,173
Hey, don't talk to me
like I'm you.

765
00:42:24,317 --> 00:42:26,218
Mayakovsky trained me himself.

766
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:30,822
I stay put until
I want to go, period.

767
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,396
Told him not to do that.
