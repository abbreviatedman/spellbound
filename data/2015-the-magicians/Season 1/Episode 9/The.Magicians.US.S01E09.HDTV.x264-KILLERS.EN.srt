1
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:01,323
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:02,791
<i>It is the beast, isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:04,026
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

4
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,761
You want to know
what the beast wants?

5
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,429
He wants control of Fillory and
all the doors that lead there.

6
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:09,364
<i>I gave you a book about it.</i>

7
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,087
<i>Stuff they're saying I did,
I don't remember.</i>

8
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,141
Were you blacked out
when we met?

9
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,677
We need something
or someone to lean on

10
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,379
<i>that is bigger than ourselves.</i>

11
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:20,014
<i>- What was that?
- Did it work?</i>

12
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,715
It was more energy
than I've ever felt.

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,353
Still the same, determined,
little Jane Chatwin.

14
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:33,694
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

15
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,896
She's the only one who could
actually give me answers.

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,731
There are no answers,

17
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:42,002
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

18
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:48,008
<i>Dear Q.,</i>

19
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,878
<i>I don't need to tell you
how pissed at you I am.</i>

20
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,546
<i>Probably got the message
around the time</i>

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,548
<i>I incepted the shit out of you.</i>

22
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,750
<i>I don't understand
why we fell apart</i>

23
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,886
<i>after being friends forever.</i>

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,156
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part.</i>

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,525
<i>I never meant
to really hurt you.</i>

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,528
<i>I put it down.
I got help.</i>

27
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:08,829
<i>I know you're not
supposed to say</i>

28
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:10,531
<i>the other person fucked up too,</i>

29
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,500
<i>but you fucked up too,</i>

30
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,103
<i>and it broke us,
and I hate you for that,</i>

31
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:18,172
<i>because I really miss us, Q.</i>

32
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:21,208
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

33
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,343
<i>Jules.</i>

34
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:25,446
<i>J., got your letter.</i>

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,614
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

36
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,585
<i>But I'm glad you're okay.
I really am.</i>

37
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,454
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

38
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:41,061
<i>It's not black and white, Julia.</i>

39
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:43,430
It's all I thought about

40
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,299
all day when I was in there,

41
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,868
and it's all that I think about
now that I'm out.

42
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:52,706
Well, there's this sometimes
very handy thing called penance.

43
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:56,310
What, like 50 magic lashes?

44
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:58,979
That spell you used to get
inside your friend's mind,

45
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:00,881
do you remember it?

46
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:02,449
That's a perfect example

47
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,986
of something that can be used
to help instead of hurt.

48
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,654
If you're not afraid
to do the work--

49
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,090
I'm not.

50
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,292
Okay.

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,898
Q.?

52
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,433
You can't sleep?

53
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:23,237
I just, uh...

54
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,806
Eliza gave me the answer,

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,307
apparently, and I lost it.

56
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,076
"Fillory and Further,
Book Six."

57
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,413
And it was important,
and it just vanished.

58
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,282
So did you look for it?

59
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:37,684
Yeah, of course.
Everywhere. I...

60
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:44,291
Fillory is always deciding

61
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,460
when to let the Chatwins go

62
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:49,663
and deciding
when to kick them out,

63
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:51,198
because Ember and Umber--

64
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:52,833
Right, the twin gods of Fillory.

65
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,768
They get mean and
take everything away, I know.

66
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:57,337
Essentially, yeah.

67
00:02:57,372 --> 00:03:00,207
They have their reasons.

68
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,709
But that's what happened
to the manuscript.

69
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:04,711
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

70
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:07,514
It's a manuscript, not a
referendum on your character.

71
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,149
No. I--

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,617
- In the books--
- So you lost it.

73
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,219
What do you do
when you lose something?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

75
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,145
So you had it the whole time.

76
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,180
I don't know what you're
yapping about, as usual.

77
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:41,882
"Book Six."

78
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,184
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

79
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,986
Like I said, it wasn't me.

80
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:50,691
Want to get that thing
out of my face?

81
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:55,262
Ugh, fine.
I took the stupid thing.

82
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:59,199
I was bored.
It was there.

83
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:00,567
Now it's gone.

84
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,169
Gone?
What do you mean, it's gone?

85
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:03,437
I mean I read it.

86
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,771
I spilled my beer on it.

87
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:06,273
I tossed it in the trash,

88
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,941
and then I went
and got another beer.

89
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:10,744
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

90
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:12,045
Wait.
You said you read it.

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,549
- Do you--do you remember it?
- Ish.

92
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,384
This is important.
Okay, I need you--

93
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,086
I need to punch you
in the throat

94
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,787
if you tell me
what I need to do.

95
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:22,623
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

96
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:24,358
You've got the scars
to prove it.

97
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:26,593
I don't understand why
we can't just be basic allies.

98
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:29,363
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

99
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:31,064
more than you want to live.
I--

100
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,036
What did Plover say in the book?
Come on.

101
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,207
First of all,
what's-his-name didn't write it.

102
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,610
Plover.
Christopher Plover.

103
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,445
The girl did.

104
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,080
Jane Chatwin.

105
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:50,817
Wrote "Book Six"?
Holy shit.

106
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,119
<i>Yeah, she started off by saying</i>

107
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,820
<i>that the other books are wrong</i>

108
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,656
<i>and she wanted to go back
and clarify some shit.</i>

109
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,257
Wrong in what way?

110
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,893
Um, this--this was
the summer that the mom died,

111
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:03,163
and they were hanging out
in Plover's mansion,

112
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:04,565
eating crumpets.

113
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,668
Right. Um...

114
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,970
<i>Jane and Martin opened a closet,</i>

115
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:11,271
<i>and they went to Fillory.</i>

116
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,007
No. Martin didn't go.

117
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,310
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

118
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,145
- Forgetting him?
- Yeah.

119
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,446
Martin was crying
like a little bitch

120
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,148
about Fillory
not wanting him anymore,

121
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:24,284
and Jane said hang tight
and she'll find some way

122
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,920
that Martin can go back
to Fillory anytime he wanted.

123
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,855
<i>Yeah, and there were,
like, creatures or something.</i>

124
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,324
<i>Questing Creature--
if you catch one,</i>

125
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,092
they're forced
to grant you a wish.

126
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,760
There's seven of them.
There's a dog, a rabbit--

127
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:35,629
Stop!

128
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:38,131
I'm literally becoming less cool
with every word you speak.

129
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,867
<i>So I assume she had
her enchanted bow</i>

130
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:42,669
so that she could
actually get one.

131
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:44,538
Uh...

132
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:46,373
Yes, right. Yes.

133
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:50,444
Stop, or I'll shoot.

134
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:52,279
Hello, human child.

135
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,348
<i>It was a dog.</i>

136
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:56,817
I need a key
to unlock the door to Fillory.

137
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,986
- I caught you, dog.
<i>- No, wait.</i>

138
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,954
Not a dog.

139
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,055
It was a pig.

140
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,991
By decree of Ember and Umber,

141
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:05,525
you must give me what I ask.

142
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,561
Wrong. No.
What was it?

143
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,229
- Back up.
- Ah, for fuck sake.

144
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:10,797
Hello, human child.

145
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,332
I caught you.

146
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,667
Give me what I ask.

147
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,868
Did it work?

148
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:17,804
As you wish, so shall it be.

149
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,079
Wait.
So the button is the key?

150
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:29,216
- Well, this all makes sense.
- It does?

151
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,751
In the last book,
Martin--

152
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:32,519
he's obsessed with finding
the lost button.

153
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,254
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

154
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:38,191
The message boards are insane,
um, with different theories,

155
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:40,327
because the books--they just say
that the button's magic.

156
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:43,196
They don't--they don't--
nothing specific about it.

157
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:46,733
- Oh, this is huge.
- Why is this huge?

158
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:49,736
Because it could still
be there at Plover's house.

159
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,905
Martin never found it.
We could--

160
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,441
Whoa, you are talking
about a direct ticket

161
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:55,776
to The fucking Beast.

162
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,577
Better than him
having one to us.

163
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:00,380
Look, this is in a manuscript
that you're probably

164
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,450
the only person
to have ever read.

165
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:05,352
There's a chance
the button's still there.

166
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:08,388
I'm going,

167
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:10,424
and like it or not,
Penny, you should come.

168
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,961
I'm coming too.

169
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,897
Okay.

170
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:19,366
So what's the quickest way
to England?

171
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,368
Ooh, Penny, do you--

172
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,370
Dick.

173
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:34,460
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

174
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:37,951
Great.
I'll--I'll pack.

175
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:39,252
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

176
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,822
- To where?
- Uh...

177
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,590
Scurry along, Ronald.

178
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:44,825
Raymond.

179
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:47,794
Raymond.
Have a great day.

180
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,937
Uh...
So you seem good.

181
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,638
Could use a top-up.

182
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,510
So where are you
flying off to, exactly?

183
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:06,246
Uh, England.

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,615
Oh, you don't need a plane.

185
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,151
Margo and I made a door directly
to our favorite pub.

186
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,320
You can get to where
you need to go from there.

187
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,122
I'll show you if you take me.

188
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,823
Margo's still in Ibiza.

189
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,525
Ronald gives terrible head.

190
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,794
It's not his fault.
TMJ.

191
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,530
I'm bored.

192
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:25,432
- You don't even know what--
- I'll catch up.

193
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:40,947
How are you today, Keira?
I brought a friend.

194
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:45,986
I've been working on
that thing we talked about.

195
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,956
Julia's here to help.
You want to lock the door?

196
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,892
Yeah.

197
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:56,630
Keira, I want you to think
of somewhere that you love.

198
00:08:56,664 --> 00:09:01,201
We're going to create that place
together in your mind.

199
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,003
She can hear us, right?

200
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,740
Julia's gonna meet you there.

201
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:10,877
She's experienced
in mental projection.

202
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,146
I wouldn't call it a specialty.

203
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,383
If anything goes pear-shaped,
I'll pull you right back.

204
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:52,953
Richard?

205
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,622
Keira?

206
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,490
Hello?

207
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:01,461
Richard, I'm stuck!
Someone get me out of here!

208
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:03,989
We screwed up.

209
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,250
Someone saw "Kill Bill."

210
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,758
Keira, Keira,

211
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,260
if you don't want me in here,
then just let me go.

212
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,964
I know shit Uma didn't know...

213
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,967
Like how to become
impervious to fire,

214
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,936
so I will walk
right out of here.

215
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:54,458
Are you Richard's friend?

216
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,026
What the hell was that?

217
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,361
Needed to see
if you were any good

218
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:58,796
before I let you near me.

219
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,432
What is it with Magicians
and tests?

220
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,435
Here.
You need a pen.

221
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:07,204
Did Richard tell you who I am?

222
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,940
Just that you're
extremely smart.

223
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:15,346
I can barely comprehend this.

224
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,448
Can you tell it doesn't work?

225
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:19,950
There was an answer.
I could feel it.

226
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:23,487
I couldn't get there.
Then my body turned on me.

227
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,958
- How long have you--
- Year.

228
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:30,027
But I still have this.

229
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:33,831
So I sat and did the rest of it.

230
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:36,700
You finished this in your mind?

231
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:39,003
I talk. You write.

232
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,005
And when you go back out,
remember what you wrote.

233
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,673
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,508
Um...

235
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:45,810
Fire at will.

236
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,348
Okay.
So we start pretty simply.

237
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,250
The framework from Popper 45.

238
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,485
Okay.

239
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:02,827
<i>This estate has been
in the Plover family</i>

240
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,562
<i>for five generations.</i>

241
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,998
Christopher Plover, already
a prolific and respected author,

242
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,167
was looking for inspiration
for his new book

243
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,770
when Jane Martin
and Rupert Chatwin

244
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,271
moved in next door.

245
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,073
- Not exactly.
- Excuse me?

246
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:18,108
Question from the back.

247
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:22,613
No, not a question,
more of a correction.

248
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:25,282
The kids got there first,
Jane and Martin,

249
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:28,219
and then Rupert got injured.

250
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:30,688
Ah, we have ourselves an expert.

251
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:32,890
- Now--
- And Plover's previous work,

252
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:35,059
uh, he--well, he only got
rejections for it.

253
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,560
It just didn't really
show the depth

254
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,295
of the "Fillory and Further"
series.

255
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,130
Stay closer.

256
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:42,933
I'm not sure I can
do this tour without you.

257
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:48,906
Now we have some pictures
of the Plover family.

258
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,976
Plover's sister Prudence

259
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,779
cared for him until
his untimely death in 1952.

260
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,648
Stay with the group, please.

261
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:59,717
Not all rooms
are for public viewing.

262
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,787
Prudence said Christopher
so understood children

263
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:06,156
because of his own
tragic childhood.

264
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,459
He aided many families
in the area

265
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,761
and paid for the education
of his housekeeper's children,

266
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,796
George and Beatrix.

267
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,333
Not only did he write
for the Chatwins,

268
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:18,736
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

269
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,306
Legend has it Jane
walked through a closet

270
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,809
in this very house
to get to Fillory.

271
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:28,345
Follow me to the writing room.

272
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:44,995
This is where Fillory was born,

273
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,998
where Plover told tales
to Jane and Martin.

274
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:51,502
As Plover wrote,
"There is no substitute

275
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,704
for a childhood of adventure,

276
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:57,174
warmth, and love."

277
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,843
You will never be a man.

278
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,213
All right,
let's find this button

279
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:04,848
and get out of here.

280
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:09,620
Shall we proceed,
criminal element?

281
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:21,198
This is where he wrote it,

282
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,634
right here.

283
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:28,339
This desk saved my life.

284
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:29,873
So I liked the books
when I was a kid,

285
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:31,241
and my friend Julia and I,

286
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:34,545
we'd pretend to be
Jane and Martin and...

287
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,847
So I was 16 the first time
I was hospitalized.

288
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:39,516
I just--I couldn't get
out of bed, like, at all.

289
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,985
I didn't know that.

290
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,421
My brain breaks sometimes.

291
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,690
And my dad brought me the books,
and I read them,

292
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:51,362
and I felt enough
like me to at least

293
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,564
try to get back
in the game, you know?

294
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:56,066
Do you still feel like that?

295
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,268
Broken brain?

296
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,204
I feel like...

297
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,672
I don't feel
that it really fixes.

298
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:03,774
It just works better now

299
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:07,945
in its own screwed up way.

300
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:11,181
Hey, would you break up
with me if I told you

301
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:13,417
that I've never been happier
in my entire life?

302
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:18,022
Guys, stop lovebirding and look.

303
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:39,610
Boring, boring...

304
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:42,079
- Completely boring.
- Hey, this could be something.

305
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:49,720
It's a letter
from Prudence, his sister,

306
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:51,321
to their lawyer.

307
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,057
Plover died
of a heart attack in 1952,

308
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:57,995
but this is all about
how he's missing, not dead.

309
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,398
She wants a death
certificate issued.

310
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,635
Whoa.

311
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:05,803
Holy shit.
They lied.

312
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,304
Why would she lie if the--

313
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,739
Rumors about Plover.

314
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,941
He--there are these kids
that were missing--

315
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:13,343
kids that knew Plover,

316
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,846
and in his absence,
people were talking,

317
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,482
and the longer that
they stayed vanished,

318
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,617
the more people started
connecting them in a bad way.

319
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:23,921
No, I bet it's more
complicated than that, right?

320
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,957
Well, because--because
Fillory is actually real.

321
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:30,694
Exactly, and Plover was crushed

322
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,262
that the Chatwins were missing,

323
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:33,997
because he knew exactly
where they went.

324
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:35,599
I love a good cover-up.

325
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,334
And the books
were already getting famous,

326
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:41,338
so maybe it was easier
just to say he died, I guess.

327
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:43,507
So what happened to him?

328
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,209
I got a theory.

329
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:49,947
McCabe, Livingston, Ali, Popper.

330
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,215
Oh, my God.

331
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,283
- He was studying magic.
- Yeah.

332
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,152
I guess that never made it
to the message boards.

333
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,286
But check this out.

334
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:59,022
Kaminsky, Umar,

335
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,858
Aurora.

336
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:02,659
I've never even heard of those.

337
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,194
Of course, you haven't.
You're not a traveler.

338
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:05,696
It's the entire 101.

339
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,865
- Plover was a traveler?
- Or he wanted to be.

340
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:10,033
I mean, you go one inch wrong,

341
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,301
you're torn to shreds.

342
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:12,569
This is amazing.

343
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:13,904
- What if--
- Try this.

344
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,073
Plover's an idiot, like you,

345
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,575
who wanted to go
to Fillory, like you,

346
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,646
so he tries a spell
and gets blown up.

347
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,850
Or it worked.

348
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:30,053
Fantastic to idiots.

349
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,992
You want some?
It never empties.

350
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,923
Trapped here. Help us.

351
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:08,559
Trapped here.
Help us.

352
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:09,726
- Alice--
- Shh.

353
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:11,695
Don't you hear that?

354
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,433
What in God's name
are you doing?

355
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,902
You set off the alarms. You have
to get out of here this instant.

356
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:21,271
Okay. Look.

357
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,440
Is this something that
can be fixed with money?

358
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:24,741
But you're not listening.

359
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,877
Are you mad, or are you scared?

360
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,979
You shouldn't be here
at night, so please--

361
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,614
What really happened to Plover?

362
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:31,882
I don't know what
you're talking about.

363
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,550
Yes, you do.

364
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,819
Ugh, he's so panicked,

365
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:37,955
I can't make sense
of anything he's thinking.

366
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:39,690
Okay.
Enough of this.

367
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:45,095
I'm a super villain.

368
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:46,430
- Now talk.
- Okay.

369
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:47,965
But then we need to go.

370
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:51,401
Plover--what was
the real deal?

371
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:54,238
He was involved
in some dark things.

372
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,672
There's a book.
It's hidden in the writing room.

373
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:56,857
Yeah.
I think we found it.

374
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,742
Prudence--she didn't
want anyone to know

375
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:00,077
the unnatural things
that her brother--

376
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:02,813
Oh, no!

377
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,748
- Oh, my God.
- Where did they go?

378
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,127
Whoa.

379
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:22,099
Okay, then.

380
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:23,934
Let's get the fuck out of here.

381
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,036
All in favor?

382
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,855
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

383
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:40,226
Penny.

384
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:43,529
Alice and Eliot.

385
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:45,397
Fuck me.

386
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,843
So where did Richard find you?

387
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:54,911
Brakebills?

388
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,846
Rehab.

389
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,948
- Really?
- Yeah.

390
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:01,251
I, uh...didn't go
to school for this.

391
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,286
You sound bitter.

392
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,021
You caught that.

393
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,589
You know, I didn't
go to school either.

394
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:08,358
Come on.

395
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,093
Well, I went to MIT,

396
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,996
but I didn't study
a lick of magic in school.

397
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,433
- This is brilliant.
- Magic is science.

398
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,268
Hard to crack on your own,

399
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,837
but far from impossible,
if you have the natural bent.

400
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,973
Yeah.

401
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,844
You know, sometimes,
I wonder if I do...

402
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,679
have it naturally.

403
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:32,048
What if it's all
just one big party trick

404
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,316
that never adds up to anything?

405
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,687
So?
What if it doesn't?

406
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:41,024
You know what I think
about when I'm in here?

407
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:46,496
This one day in this park
with my girlfriend.

408
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,897
We sat here in the rain

409
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:50,800
doing this dumb little spell
over and over,

410
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:54,404
making a rainbow
that lasted ten seconds.

411
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:56,740
Sounds lovely.

412
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:59,342
It was.

413
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:02,645
Best day of my life.

414
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,748
What's yours?

415
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,416
Here.

416
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,986
While you and Richard
are juicing me up, show me.

417
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,395
I was ten
with my friend Quentin.

418
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,732
No one bothered us under here.
It was like we were invisible.

419
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,501
We'd read "Fillory" books
for hours.

420
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:25,769
I loved those.

421
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:31,107
One day, we made this

422
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:33,176
like we were gonna go visit.

423
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:38,615
We were playing,
but it felt real.

424
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,852
See this.

425
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:44,854
Chase this.

426
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:49,726
It's the secret
to how to be you.

427
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,263
Okay. Back to the park.

428
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:55,365
Let's finish this puppy.

429
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,066
Alice?

430
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,937
Eliot?

431
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,405
- Alice!
- Chill, man.

432
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,773
They can handle themselves.

433
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:06,876
Shh, shh!

434
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,478
What the hell was that?

435
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,982
This house is haunted
as balls, is what that is.

436
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:16,252
Come in here, please.

437
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,631
Okay...

438
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:32,135
Hello?

439
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:35,305
Anyone or anything?

440
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,357
Okay, Jesus, we get it.

441
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:56,526
There are ghosts in here.

442
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,462
I tag you.

443
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:01,431
You're it.

444
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:12,876
What just happened?

445
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,978
I tag you.
You're it.

446
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,949
Do we go with this?

447
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:23,052
What other option do we have?

448
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:47,710
Okay, this is a little kinky,
even for me.

449
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,980
Would you care for refreshment?

450
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:55,919
Oh, um, okay, sure.
Sounds divine.

451
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:59,022
Mmm. Okay.

452
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:00,890
Thank you.

453
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:04,227
We must get these things
off our hands.

454
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,728
Do you know Popper 29 yet?

455
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,397
No magic in the house.

456
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:10,733
Be good, or she'll take you
to the quiet place.

457
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,504
We'll be good.
Right, Eliot?

458
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,106
Mm, yeah, you're the boss, kid.

459
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:20,343
She's coming.

460
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:33,256
Stop doing that.

461
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:40,863
My brother is too soft,

462
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:45,268
caring for you when he
needs peace to work.

463
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:50,740
He has no idea
how naughty you truly are.

464
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:52,976
Now drink your tea.

465
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,587
Drink it.

466
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:21,637
No.
I'm over here.

467
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:31,581
Holy shit,
that's Christopher Plover.

468
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,119
Is it just me,
or does it feel like

469
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:37,520
we're being shown something,
like how it was?

470
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:39,489
Yeah, the time slip.

471
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,257
You say that like,
"Yeah, a sunrise."

472
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,292
Sunderland talks
about it all the time.

473
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:44,861
She has a PhD in hauntings.

474
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:46,629
Her favorite thing
about a haunted house is,

475
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:49,165
you get these ghost movies
of the past running on a loop.

476
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,034
You see shit like it was.

477
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:52,335
I didn't know any of that.

478
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,669
Of course not.
You're an idiot.

479
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,606
Oh, my God, it's her.

480
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,341
It's a tiny chick in a beret.

481
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,443
Slow down, Jane.

482
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,545
That's Jane and Martin
from the books.

483
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,680
- Nerdgasm.
- This makes sense.

484
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,482
Plover took them in,
and they spent their days

485
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:08,051
playing with
the housekeeper's kids.

486
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,552
Martin--he was, like,
really sick that summer--

487
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:11,487
Martin, hurry!

488
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:14,657
Janey, wait for me.

489
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:16,959
Wait, no.
I'm coming with you.

490
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:22,031
Why won't you take me?

491
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:25,468
Ember, Umber, why won't you
let me in anymore?

492
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:32,642
I try to be good.

493
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,345
Martin, are you all right?

494
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,680
Where's Jane?

495
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:39,649
Fillory.

496
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,851
What's wrong with me?

497
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:44,153
Nothing.

498
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,855
Some things just aren't fair.

499
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:47,557
We can't make sense of them.

500
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:49,192
Let's have tea, hmm?
Come on.

501
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:52,261
Us left-behinds
ought to stick together.

502
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,736
She's coming.
We need to hide.

503
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:02,338
Quentin?

504
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:07,276
Okay, I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

505
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:09,245
What did I tell you children

506
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,785
about disturbing
Mr. Plover?

507
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:34,729
Great.

508
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:36,898
No talking in the quiet place.

509
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:38,233
Lady, I don't know
who you think I am, but--

510
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:42,137
Insolent is what you are.

511
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:46,741
I've told you I'll sew it shut.

512
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,145
Alice.

513
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:05,493
Hey, hey, we need to hustle.

514
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:07,395
Mrs. Danvers could come back.

515
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:08,897
Oh, my God.

516
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,565
Do you know what this is?

517
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,967
A vaguely whimsical horror show?

518
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:14,602
She did this.

519
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:16,471
She really did this to
the children--Plover's sister.

520
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:17,805
She tied them up
and drugged them

521
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,607
so that they wouldn't
disturb his work.

522
00:28:19,642 --> 00:28:22,010
Okay, well, maybe ghost girl
can tell us where the button is.

523
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,444
Hey, Beatrix?

524
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,613
Beatrix, hey.

525
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:28,783
My tummy feels bad.

526
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:31,186
Beatrix, it's okay.

527
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,523
- How can we help her?
- I don't think we can.

528
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,798
Well, I guess we know
how she died.

529
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:45,667
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

530
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:48,269
It's okay.
It's over.

531
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:49,671
It's been over for a long time.

532
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:51,139
No, no, no, no.
Not for her.

533
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:52,840
She just keeps reliving it
over and over.

534
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:53,875
- We have to--
- We have to go.

535
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:56,811
We have to go.

536
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:58,346
It's not the same.

537
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,615
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

538
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:02,850
Here, have another.

539
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:05,620
Hmm.

540
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:08,856
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

541
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,392
Oh, shall we work a little?

542
00:29:11,427 --> 00:29:14,729
I think that might be nice.

543
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,965
Do you think that might be nice?

544
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,135
Martin, Mr. Plover,
I'm back.

545
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,503
I was in Fillory.

546
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:24,205
Martin, I brought you
what you asked for.

547
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,074
- You must have a look.
- We'll be right back, sir.

548
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:29,210
She's dragging mud
all over the floor.

549
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:34,882
Stop that.
You're pinching me.

550
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,384
- You've got it?
- Yes.

551
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,418
Let's go show Mr. Plover.

552
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:39,854
No, please.
Let's not.

553
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:41,222
For me.

554
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,757
The button's a key.

555
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:49,330
I know you're here.

556
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:50,898
I know you're spying on us.

557
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:53,368
George, come out.

558
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,941
Take this.

559
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,609
It's a game, George.

560
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:04,245
How well can you
hide the button?

561
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,853
All right.

562
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:14,222
Well, I--I won't forget
any of it, so...

563
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:16,291
I know you won't.

564
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,860
Can I give you a little
advice in return?

565
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:21,729
- Yeah.
- Forget that school.

566
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,197
The world never did help
a smart girl.

567
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,699
Why would it?

568
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:27,969
We scare the shit
out of the world.

569
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:31,072
If the world goes after you,
take it as a compliment.

570
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:39,414
You know, I could come back.
We could--we could do more.

571
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:42,050
- This was really the big one.
- No, I know.

572
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:44,719
I just--I just--you know,
I'm sure you have more things--

573
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:46,220
I do need one other thing.

574
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:48,289
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

575
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:51,793
Kill me.

576
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:53,761
That's--that's crazy.

577
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:56,497
I'm allowed to be done.

578
00:30:56,532 --> 00:31:00,501
- No. I can't.
- Well, I need you to.

579
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,807
You knew.

580
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:07,442
You knew, and you did--

581
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:08,776
No, I did not sign up for this.

582
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:10,411
Then what?
Pleasantries?

583
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:12,280
No, how about
not killing anyone?

584
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:14,248
What do you think redemption
looks like, Julia?

585
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:16,617
Being nice?
Donating shoes to Africa?

586
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:20,355
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

587
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,090
What if she's wrong?

588
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:25,159
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

589
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:27,795
What if there really is a hell
and this takes me there?

590
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,431
You're already in hell.
So is she.

591
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:37,004
What am I supposed to do?

592
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,407
Whichever's hardest.

593
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:51,152
Oh, thank you.

594
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:54,322
Drink up, Jane, and eat.

595
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:56,324
You must be famished.

596
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:10,838
Jane, don't you want to join us?

597
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:17,378
Oh, she's tired.

598
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,013
That's all right.

599
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:23,050
You go ahead, Martin,
like last time.

600
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:27,355
I don't know if I want to.

601
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:29,223
Remember when I took
you and your sister

602
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:31,993
to town for cinema?

603
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:33,828
Bought her that dress
she wanted.

604
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:35,096
Yes.
We're grateful.

605
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,165
When I was a boy,

606
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,734
I didn't have anyone
who thought about me.

607
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:43,905
I saw it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

608
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:46,541
I care about you, Martin.

609
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:50,511
Come on, in front of the camera.

610
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,951
Give me a smile.

611
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,853
Mm.

612
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:01,055
Oh, I have the best news.

613
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,958
I am so close
to figuring it all out.

614
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:06,394
Wild magic,

615
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:09,230
too strong to do
with human hands.

616
00:33:09,264 --> 00:33:10,765
I'd have to grow another finger.

617
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,135
Can you imagine?

618
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:15,937
Of course, there's
spellwork for that too,

619
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:17,572
if I can master it.

620
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:22,276
All right, you can go ahead
and take that off now.

621
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:42,530
Trousers too, darling.
All of it.

622
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:50,304
I think the solution
to all our problems

623
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:52,240
lies in Fillory.

624
00:33:52,274 --> 00:33:54,008
I need to go there with you.

625
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:55,476
- But--
- I know.

626
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:56,844
It's been for you kids.

627
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:59,847
But I think we could
find a way to go.

628
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:03,150
We could be together.

629
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,587
You're a lovely boy, Martin.

630
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:10,791
Now turn around.

631
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:17,632
They play like that
all the time.

632
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,467
A whole pile of naughty pictures

633
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:20,935
hidden in the dictionary.

634
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,170
Oh, no.
The mean lady.

635
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,607
- Little spy!
- I didn't see anything!

636
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:28,109
- I swear.
- May God punish you.

637
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:30,211
- My brother is a good man.
- No.

638
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,780
You all hound him.
It's your fault.

639
00:34:32,814 --> 00:34:34,882
Stop.
Leave him alone.

640
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:42,223
Hmm.

641
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:45,526
To the quiet place,

642
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,361
for the best.

643
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,995
- We should go back in there.
- Shh.

644
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:12,217
I'm trying to think,
and I'm out of cigarettes.

645
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:14,253
This is dire.

646
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:16,755
Oh, my God.
You're okay.

647
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:19,458
We're great.
We're both great, actually.

648
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,026
Where's Penny?

649
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,696
Knowing him, Disneyland by now.

650
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:27,132
What if he got to Fillory?

651
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,067
What did he do to Martin?

652
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:30,969
What are you talking about?

653
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,943
I saw something
in there--

654
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:39,578
who Plover really was,

655
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:42,614
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

656
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:46,251
What...was he doing?

657
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,622
Oh, God.

658
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:52,224
The poor kid, he was just trying

659
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:53,959
to get a button to Fillory,

660
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:56,762
you know, so he could escape
this monster, who, by the way,

661
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:59,398
generations of idiots like me
have been worshiping

662
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,733
like a literary god...

663
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,773
who was...learning magic

664
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:10,442
to get stronger, to travel,

665
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:14,746
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

666
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,782
Grow fingers?
Like--

667
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:18,650
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

668
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:21,420
What if he went there
because he had access

669
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:24,022
via these kids who he liked
to tell stories to

670
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:28,260
when he wasn't drugging
and raping them?

671
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:31,029
Jesus.

672
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:35,133
Well, I still have
the capacity to be surprised.

673
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:37,502
We thought you ditched us.

674
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:39,972
What happened to you?

675
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:42,174
Man, I traveled into
a fuck tree about a mile off,

676
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,377
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

677
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,714
Not so precise
with the travel, huh?

678
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,182
Shut up.

679
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:52,117
Wait, what do you mean, dungeon?

680
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,485
I mean some
dirt-floor basement

681
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,187
bitch calls the quiet place,

682
00:36:55,221 --> 00:36:56,788
'cause that's not
fuck psychotic.

683
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,724
There's a storm cellar
around the back.

684
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,325
That's where she took
the housekeeper's kid.

685
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,460
He's got the button
in his pocket.

686
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:03,395
- Let's go.
- Whoa.

687
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,731
That's a great idea if you want
Prudence to grab us immediately.

688
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,999
- Dislike.
- Okay.

689
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,800
I know what to do about her.

690
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:12,404
Give me a ten-minute head start,
and then head to the cellar.

691
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,980
What are you doing
out of the playroom?

692
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:23,882
This is going well.

693
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,350
- Where the hell's Quentin?
- He's coming.

694
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:27,085
You're all going
to the quiet place.

695
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,987
Hey, Prudence!

696
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:31,023
I heard the nastiest rumor

697
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:34,526
about your brother.

698
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,195
Okay, fine, but there are
about 48 more of those

699
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,164
that I just hid
all over the house.

700
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:40,494
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows exactly

701
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,730
what Christopher Plover did.

702
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,831
No.

703
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:45,708
Okay.

704
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:48,678
Well, that bought us
about ten minutes.

705
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,347
Let's go dig up a dead body.

706
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:57,886
It's done.

707
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,322
Richard and I,
we--

708
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:04,727
So this is what that's like.

709
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,758
Do you want me to stay?

710
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:08,460
So you're found
meditating in my room

711
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,582
next to my overdosed corpse?

712
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,469
Yeah, well, when you
put it like that...

713
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:24,281
Bye, Julia.

714
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:27,084
Have a good life.

715
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:40,865
We'd better go.

716
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:54,879
Quentin.

717
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,816
We have to go back.

718
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,919
- Come on.
- We have to go back, Quentin.

719
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:36,020
And do what, exactly?

720
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:38,389
Help those children.

721
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:42,059
You can't seriously be thinking
of leaving them there.

722
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:43,527
They were there
before we were born.

723
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,696
Trapped.

724
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,997
This is exactly
the kind of thing

725
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:49,166
that we should be able to fix.

726
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,268
There are ways
to clear a haunted house.

727
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:52,603
The house, yes.

728
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,371
It doesn't help with the ghosts.

729
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:56,707
There are rituals
in every civilization.

730
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:01,345
To prevent this, not reverse it.

731
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:02,713
We have to help them.

732
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,748
There has to be something.

733
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:07,184
Those kids--
they did nothing.

734
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:08,919
That is so unfair.

735
00:40:08,954 --> 00:40:11,221
- You don't say.
- You're not helping.

736
00:40:11,256 --> 00:40:12,690
I'm the only one helping.

737
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,693
Life ain't fair.

738
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:18,696
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

739
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,431
Thinking that you can
change anything--

740
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,967
it's such an act
of monumental ego.

741
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:25,803
I mean, who the fuck
do you think you really are?

742
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,705
I mean, you're just some
arrogant, little twat.

743
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,341
- So suck it up.
- Shut the fuck up.

744
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:39,049
Vix,

745
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:42,953
if we're gonna go, we got to go.

746
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:45,322
Okay.

747
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:47,458
Come on.

748
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:12,149
Thanks, but I'm okay.

749
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,418
No, you're not.

750
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:16,120
Okay, I'm not.

751
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,423
Are you okay?

752
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,427
No.

753
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:29,166
I've been freaked about The
Beast since that day, you know?

754
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,003
I've been worried about myself,

755
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:37,708
and now that we know
who he is, what he is,

756
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:42,012
what he did to those kids,
Martin, I just...

757
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,714
I want to kill him, you know?

758
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,349
I want to--I want to step
through the nearest clock,

759
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:47,017
and I want to wring his neck.

760
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:49,119
Okay.

761
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:51,655
Let's see this button.

762
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:01,331
It looks so ordinary.

763
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:04,868
No, I feel something
coming off of it...

764
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:07,137
hard.

765
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:15,479
You guys really don't feel that?

766
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:16,914
Maybe you should put it away.

767
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,982
Hey, don't talk to me
like I'm you.

768
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:20,918
Mayakovsky trained me himself.

769
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:25,522
I stay put until
I want to go, period.

770
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,096
Told him not to do that.

771
00:42:33,305 --> 00:42:39,545
