1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,285
QUENTIN: Previously
on The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,441
QUENTIN: <i>It is The Beast,
isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,851
<i>And he's from Fillory,
which is real.</i>

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,251
Want to know what
The Beast wants?

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,727
He wants control of Fillory and
all the doors that lead there.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,290
ELIZA: <i>I gave you</i>
a <i>book about it.</i>

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,091
Stuff they're saying I did,
I don't remember.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,009
Were you blacked
out when we met?

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,130
We need something or someone to lean
on that is bigger than ourselves.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,929
JULIA: <i>What was that?
RICHARD: Did it work?</i>

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,690
More energy than
I've ever felt.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,207
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,521
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,887
She is the only one who can
actually give me answers.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,246
There are no answers,

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,450
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,884
JULIA: Dear Q,

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,930
<i>I don't need to tell you how
fucking pissed at you I am.</i>

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,604
<i>Probably got
the message around the time</i>

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,648
<i>I incepted
the shit out of you.</i>

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,805
<i>I don't understand why we fell
apart after being friends forever.</i>

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,602
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part. I
never meant to really hurt you.</i>

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,287
<i>I put it down. I got help.</i>

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,641
<i>I know you're
not supposed to say</i>

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,563
<i>the other person
fucked up, too,</i>

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,961
<i>but you fucked up, too.</i>

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,123
<i>And it broke us, and I hate you for
that, because I really miss us, Q.</i>

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,128
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,326
<i>Jules.</i>

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,846
<i>QUENTIN: J, got your letter.</i>

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,523
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,044
<i>But I'm glad you're okay.
I really am.</i>

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,365
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,964
<i>RICHARD: It's not black
and white, Julia.</i>

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,926
It's all I thought about
all day when I was in there,

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,850
and it's all that I
think about now that I'm out.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,602
Well, there's this sometimes very
handy thing called "penance."

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,284
What, like 50 magic lashes?
(CHUCKLES)

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,010
That spell you used

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,889
to get inside your friend's
mind, do you remember it?

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,724
That's a perfect
example of something

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,969
that can be used to
help instead of hurt.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,610
If you’re not
afraid to do the work...

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,920
I'm not.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,681
Okay.)'-

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,847
Q?

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,565
You can't sleep?

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,046
I just, uh...

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,291
Eliza gave me the answer,
apparently, and I lost it.

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,005
<i>Fillory and Further, book six.</i>

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,368
lt was important,
and it just vanished.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,331
So did you look for it?

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,561
Yeah, of course.
Everywhere. I...

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,001
(SIGHS)

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,921
Fillory is always deciding
when to let the Chatwins go

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,610
and deciding when
to kick them out,

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,125
because Ember and Umber...

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,770
Right, twin gods of Fillory.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,683
They get mean and take
everything away, I know.

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,326
Essentially, yeah.
They have their reasons.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,681
But that's what happened
in the manuscript.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,644
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,446
It's a manuscript, not a
referendum on your character.

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,726
No. I...

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,531
In the books...
So you lost it.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,170
What do you do when
you lose something?

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,090
So you had it the whole time.

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,244
I don't know what you're
yapping about, <i>as</i> usual.

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,731
Book six.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,246
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,970
Like I said, it wasn't me.

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,361
(SCOFFS)

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,611
Want to get that
thing out of my face?

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,042
Fine. I took the stupid thing.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,411
I was bored. lt was there.

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,481
Now it's gone.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,005
"Gone?"
What do you mean, it's gone?

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,531
I mean I read it,

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,246
I spilled my beer on it,
I tossed it in the trash,

80
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,890
and then I went
and got another beer.

81
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,807
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,451
Wait. You said you read it.
Do you remember it?

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,447
Ish.

84
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,329
This is important.
Okay, I need you...

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,050
I need to punch
you in the throat

86
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,889
if you tell me
what I need to do.

87
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,405
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

88
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,965
You've got
the scars to prove it.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,846
I don't understand why we can't
just be basic allies. (CHUCKLES)

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,285
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,283
more than you want to live.
I...

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,727
What did Plover say
in the book? Come on.

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,283
First of all, what's-his-name
didn't write it.

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,404
Plover. Christopher Plover.

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,007
(CLEARS THROAT)
The girl did. Jane Chatwin.

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,803
Wrote book six? Holy shit.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,120
<i>Yeah,
she started off by saying</i>

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,167
<i>that the other
books were wrong,</i>

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,607
<i>and she wanted to go back
and clarify some shit.</i>

100
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,767
Wrong in what way?

101
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,810
Um, this was the summer
that the mom died,

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,568
and they were hanging out in
Plover's mansion, eating crumpets.

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,046
Right, um...

104
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,244
<i>Jane and Martin opened a closet,
and they went to Fillory.</i>

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,963
No. Martin didn't go.

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,290
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,725
"Forgetting him"?

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,325
Yeah. Martin was
crying like a little bitch

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,129
about Fillory not
wanting him anymore,

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,363
and Jane said, "Hang tight,"
and she'll find some way

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,886
that Martin can go back
to Fillory anytime he wanted.

112
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,849
<i>I dunno, there were, like,
creatures or something.</i>

113
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,126
Questing Creature.
If you catch one,

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,361
they're forced to
grant you a wish.

115
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,681
There's seven of them. There's
a, uh, uh, dog, a rabbit..

116
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,921
Stop!

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm literally becoming less
cool with every word you speak.

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,691
So, I assume she, uh,
had her enchanted bow,

119
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,603
uh, so that she could
actually get one.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,290
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,364
Yes, right. Yes.

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,040
Stop, or I'll shoot.

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,965
DOG: Hello, human child.

124
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,206
PENNY: lt was a <i>dog.</i>

125
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,129
I need a key to
unlock the door to Fillory.

126
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
I caught you,dog.

127
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,726
No, wait. Not a dog.

128
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,007
It was a pig.

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,440
By decree of Ember and Umber,
you must give me what I ask.

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,807
Wrong.
No. What was it? Back up.

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,120
For fuck's sake.

132
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,044
Hello, human child.

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,566
I caught you.
Give me what I ask.

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,881
Did it work?

135
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,686
As you wish, so shall it be.

136
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,287
ALICE: <i>Wait.</i>

137
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,005
So, the button is the key?

138
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,886
Well, this all makes sense.

139
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,246
It does?

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,563
In the last book, Martin, he's
obsessed with finding the lost button.

141
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,721
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,124
The message boards are insane,
urn, with different theories,

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,202
because the books... They just
say that the button's magic.

144
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,284
They don't...
Nothing specific about it.

145
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,964
This is huge.

146
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,605
Why is this huge?

147
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,731
Because it could still
be there at Plover's house.

148
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,166
Martin never found it.

149
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,407
We could...

150
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,723
You are talking about a direct
ticket to The fucking Beast.

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,564
Better than him
having one to us.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,446
Look, this is in
a manuscript

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,161
that you're probably the only
person to have ever read.

154
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,244
There's a chance
the button's still there.

155
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,363
I'm going, and like it or
not, Penny, you should come.

156
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,170
I'm coming, too.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,047
Okay.

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,168
So, what's
the quickest way to England?

159
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,005
Penny, do you...

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,407
Dick.

161
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,769
Uh, great. I'll pack.

162
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,171
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

163
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,366
ELIOT: To where?

164
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,681
Uh...

165
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,604
Scurry along, Ronald.

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,047
Raymond.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,726
Have a great day.

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,721
Um...

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,843
So, you seem good.

170
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,922
Could use a top-up.

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,050
So, where are you
flying off to, exactly?

172
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,481
Uh, England.

173
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,921
Oh?

174

There was an answer. I could feel it.
I couldn't get there.

No, uh, uh not a question,

The kids got there first,
Jane and Martin,

242
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,166

so understood children

258

He aided many

259

261
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,131
Not only did he
write for the Chatwins,

262
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,887
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

Fillory was born,

people were talking,

they stayed vanished,

Because Fillory
is actually real.

313

were missing,

already getting famous,

Well, I went to MIT, but I didn't
study a lick of magic in school.

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,641
(COUGHING)

527
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,687
How can we help her?

528
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,881
I don't think we can.

529
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,962
(COUGHING)

530
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,127
Well,
I guess we know how she died.

531
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,964
ALICE: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

532
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,086
It's okay. It's over. It's
been over for a long time.

533
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,289
No, no, no. Not for her. She just
keeps reliving it over and over.

534
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,567
We have to...
We have to go. We have to go.

535
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,923
MARTIN: It's not the same.
PLOVER: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

536
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,483
Here, have another.

537
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,729
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

538
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,121
Oh!

539
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,246
Shall we work a little?
I think that might be nice.

540
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,202
Do you think
that might be nice?

541
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,843
Martin, Mr. Plover,
I'm back. I was in Fillory.

542
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,524
JANE: Martin, I brought
you what you asked for.

543
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,921
You must have a look.
We'll be right back, sir.

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,128
She's tracking mud
all over the floor.

545
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,251
JANE: Stop that.
You're pinching me.

546
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,321
You've got it?

547
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,765
Yes. Let's go show Mr. Plover.

548
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,043
No, please.
Let's not. For me.

549
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,005
JANE: The button's a key.

550
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,251
I know you're here.
I know you're spying on us.

551
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,210
George, come out.

552
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,320
Take this.
It's a game, George.

553
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,084
How well can you
hide the button?

554
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,091
All right.

555
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,164
Well, I won’t
forget any of it, so...

556
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,930
I know you won't.

557
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,928
Can I give you
a little advice in return?

558
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,051
Yeah.
Forget that school.

559
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,010
The world never did help a smart girl.
Why would it?

560
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,764
We scare the shit
out of the world.

561
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,603
If the world goes after you,
take it as a compliment.

562
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,890
You know, I could come back.
We could do more.

563
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,361
This was really the big one.
No, I know.

564
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,011
I just... You know, I'm sure
you have more things...

565
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,366
I do need one other thing.

566
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,249
Yeah, sure. Anything.

567
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,446
Kill me.

568
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,201
That's crazy.

569
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,169
I'm allowed to be done.

570
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,566
No. I can't.

571
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,011
Well, I need you to.

572
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,847
(GASPS)

573
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,809
You knew.
You knew, and you did...

574
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,245
No,
I did not sign up for this.

575
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,685
Then what?
Pleasantries?

576
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,649
No,
how about not killing anyone?

577
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,723
What do you think
redemption looks like, Julia?

578
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,041
Being nice?
Donating shoes to Africa?

579
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,441
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

580
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,086
What if she's wrong?

581
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,811
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

582
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,081
What if there really is a hell
and this takes me there?

583
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,521
You're already in hell.
So is she.

584
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,491
What am I supposed to do?

585
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,170
Whichever's hardest.

586
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,561
(INHALES DEEPLY)

(OWL HOOTING)

588
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,851
Oh, thank you.

589
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,203
Drink up, Jane, and eat.
You must be famished.

590
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,201
Jane,
don't you want to join us?

591
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,840
Oh, she's tired.
That's all right.

592
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,330
You go ahead, Martin.
Like last time.

593
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,166
I don't know if I want to.

594
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,726
Remember when I took you and
your sister to town for cinema?

595
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,010
Bought her that dress
she wanted.

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,606
Yes. We're grateful.

597
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,526
When I was a boy, I didn't have
anyone who thought about me.

598
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,084
I swore it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

599
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,204
I care about you, Martin.

600
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,045
Come on,
in front of the camera.

601
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,282
Give me a smile.

602
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,561
(CAMERA CLICKS)

603
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,208
Oh, I have the best news. I am
so close to figuring it all out.

604
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,362
Wild magic. Too strong
to do with human hands.

605
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,565
I'll have to grow another finger.
(LAUGHS) Can you imagine?

606
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,003
Of course, there's spellwork for
that, too, if I can master it.

607
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,760
All right, you can go ahead
and take that off now.

608
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,963
Trousers, too, darling.
All of it.

609
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,761
(CAMERA CLICKS)

610
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,285
I think the solution to all of
our problems lies in Fillory.

611
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,404
I need to go there with you.

612
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,967
But... I know. It's
been for you kids,

613
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,281
but I think we
could find a way to go.

614
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,241
(CAMERA CLICKS)

615
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,643
We could be together.

616
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,969
You're a lovely boy, Martin.

617
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,890
Now turn around.

618
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,841
They play like that
all the time.

619
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,324
A whole pile of naughty pictures
hidden in the dictionary.

620
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,487
Oh, no. The mean lady.

621
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,124
Little spy!
I didn't see anything!

622
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,645
I swear.
May God punish you.

623
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,609
My brother is a good man.
No.

624
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,206
You all hound him.
It's your fault.

625
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,486
Stop. Leave him alone.

626
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,601
(EXHALES)

627
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,009
To the quiet place.

628
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,605
For the best.

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,210
(LIGHTS BUZZING)

630
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,410
ALICE: We should go back in there.
ELIOT: Shh...

631
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,690
I'm trying to think, and I'm out
of cigarettes. This is dire.

632
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,285
Oh, my God. You're okay.

633
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,761
We're great.
We're both great, actually.

634
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,881
Where's Penny?

635
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,124
Knowing him,
Disneyland by now.

636
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,450
What if he got to Fillory?
What did he do to Martin?

637
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,601
What are you talking about?

638
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,450
I saw something in there,

639
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,567
who Plover really was,

640
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,885
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

641
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,244
Well, what was he doing?

642
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,405
Oh, God.

643
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,925
QUENTIN: The poor kid, he was just
trying to get a button to Fillory,

644
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,164
you know, so he could escape
this monster, who, by the way,

645
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,450
generations of idiots like me have
been worshiping like a literary god,

646
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,245
who was learning magic...

647
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,285
To get stronger, to travel,

648
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,522
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

649
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,328
Grow fingers? Like...

650
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,765
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

651
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,607
What if he went there
because he had access

652
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,365
via these kids who he
liked to tell stories to

653
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,047
when he wasn't
drugging and raping them?

654
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,965
Jesus.

655
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,450
Well, I still have
the capacity to be surprised.

656
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,281
Thought you ditched us.

657
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,086
What happened to you?

658
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,728
Man, I traveled into a fucking
tree about a mile off,

659
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,690
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

660
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,083
Not so precise
with the travel?

661
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,489
Shut up. Wait, what do
you mean, “dungeon”?

662
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,325
I mean some dirt-floor basement
bitch calls "the quiet place,"

663
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,402
'cause that's not
fucking psychotic.

664
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,050
There's a storm
cellar around the back.

665
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,565
QUENTIN: That's where she took
the housekeeper's kid.

666
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,005
He's got the button in
his pocket. Let's go.

667
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,321
Whoa! That's a great
idea if you want

668
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,640
Prudence to grab
us immediately.

669
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,401
Dislike.

670
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,567
Okay.
I know what to do about her.

671
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,725
Uh, give me a 10-minute head start,
and then head to the cellar.

672
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,531
What are you doing
out of the playroom?

673
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,567
This is going well.

674
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,966
Where the hell's Quentin?
He's coming.

675
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,247
You're all going to
the quiet place...

676
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,321
QUENTIN: Hey, Prudence!

677
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,723
I heard the nastiest rumor
about your brother.

678
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,646
Okay, fine, but there are
about 48 more of those

679
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,449
that I just hid
all over the house.

680
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,046
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows
exactly what Christopher Plover did.

681
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,201
No.

682
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,526
Okay.

683
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,401
Well, that bought
us about 10 minutes.

684
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,168
Let's go dig up a dead body.

685
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,531
JULIA: It's done.

686
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,969
Richard and I, we...

687
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,043
So this is what that's like.

688
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,961
Do you want me to stay?

689
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,567
So you're found meditating in my
room next to my overdosed corpse?

690
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,285
Yeah, well,
when you put it like that...

691
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,441
(CHUCKLES)

692
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,086

693
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,730
Have a good life.

696
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,730
We'd better go.

(JULIA SOBBING)

698
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,001
Quentin.

699
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,168
ALICE: We have to go back.
Come on.

700
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,480
We have to go back, Quentin.

701
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,846
And do what, exactly?

702
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,844
Help those children.

703
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,726
You can't seriously be thinking
of leaving them there.

704
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,491
They were there
before we were born.

705
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,926
ALICE: Trapped.

706
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,968
This is exactly the kind of thing
that we should be able to fix.

707
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,202
There are ways to
clear a haunted house.

708
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,284
The house, yes. It doesn't
help with the ghosts.

709
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,647
There are rituals in
every civilization...

710
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,047
To prevent this,
not reverse it.

711
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,843
We have to help them.
There has to be something.

712
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,481
Those kids, they did nothing.
It is so unfair.

713
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,206
You don't say.

714
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,487
You're not helping.
I'm the only one helping.

715
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,887
(CHUCKLES)

716
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,610
Life ain't fair.

717
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,729
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

718
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,450
Thinking that you
can change anything,

719
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,841
it's such an act
of monumental ego.

720
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,764
I mean, who the fuck
do you think you really are?

721
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,524
I mean, you're just
some arrogant, little twat.

722
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,722
So suck it up.
Shut the fuck up.

723
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,686
Vix...

724
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,849
If we're gonna go,
we got to go.

725
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,810
Thanks, but I'm okay.

726
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,530
No, you're not.

727
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,885
Okay, I'm not.

728
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,686
Are you okay?

729
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,681
No.

730
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,241
Well...

731
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,010
I've been freaked about The
Beast since that day, you know?

732
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,242
And I've been worried
about myself.

733
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,727
And now that we know
who he is, what he is,

734
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,650
what he did to those kids,
Martin, I just...

735
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,527
I want to kill him, you know?

736
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,843
I want to step through the nearest
clock, and I want to wring his neck.

737
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,446
PENNY: Okay.

738
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,403
Let's see this button.

739
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,523
It looks so ordinary.

740
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,011
No, I feel something
coming off of it, hard.

741
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,849
You guys really
don't feel that?

742
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,970
I think
you should put it away.

743
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,491
Hey, don't talk
to me like I'm you.

744
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,729
Mayakovsky trained me himself.

745
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,246
I stay put until I want to go.

746
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,480
Period.

747
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,965
Told him not to do that.
