1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,320
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,790
<i>It is the beast, isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,020
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

4
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,760
You want to know
what the beast wants?

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,420
He wants control of Fillory and
all the doors that lead there.

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,360
<i>I gave you a book about it.</i>

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,080
<i>Stuff they're saying I did,
I don't remember.</i>

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,140
Were you blacked out
when we met?

9
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,670
We need something
or someone to lean on

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,370
<i>that is bigger than ourselves.</i>

11
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,010
<i>- What was that?
- Did it work?</i>

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,710
It was more energy
than I've ever felt.

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,350
Still the same, determined,
little Jane Chatwin.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,690
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,890
She's the only one who could
actually give me answers.

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,730
There are no answers,

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,000
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>Dear Q.,</i>

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,870
<i>I don't need to tell you
how pissed at you I am.</i>

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,540
<i>Probably got the message
around the time</i>

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,540
<i>I incepted the shit out of you.</i>

22
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,750
<i>I don't understand
why we fell apart</i>

23
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,880
<i>after being friends forever.</i>

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,150
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part.</i>

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,520
<i>I never meant
to really hurt you.</i>

26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,520
<i>I put it down.
I got help.</i>

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,820
<i>I know you're not
supposed to say</i>

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,530
<i>the other person fucked up too,</i>

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,500
<i>but you fucked up too,</i>

30
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,100
<i>and it broke us,
and I hate you for that,</i>

31
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,170
<i>because I really miss us, Q.</i>

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,340
<i>Jules.</i>

34
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,440
<i>J., got your letter.</i>

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,610
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,580
<i>But I'm glad you're okay.
I really am.</i>

37
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,450
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,060
<i>It's not black and white, Julia.</i>

39
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,430
It's all I thought about

40
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,290
all day when I was in there,

41
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,860
and it's all that I think about
now that I'm out.

42
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,700
Well, there's this sometimes
very handy thing called penance.

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,310
What, like 50 magic lashes?

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,970
That spell you used to get
inside your friend's mind,

45
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,880
do you remember it?

46
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,440
That's a perfect example

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,980
of something that can be used
to help instead of hurt.

48
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,650
If you're not afraid
to do the work--

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,090
I'm not.

50
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,290
Okay.

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,890
Q.?

52
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,430
You can't sleep?

53
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,230
I just, uh...

54
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,800
Eliza gave me the answer,

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,300
apparently, and I lost it.

56
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,070
"Fillory and Further,
Book Six."

57
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,410
And it was important,
and it just vanished.

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,280
So did you look for it?

59
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah, of course.
Everywhere. I...

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,290
Fillory is always deciding

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,460
when to let the Chatwins go

62
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,660
and deciding
when to kick them out,

63
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,190
because Ember and Umber--

64
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,830
Right, the twin gods of Fillory.

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,760
They get mean and
take everything away, I know.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,330
Essentially, yeah.

67
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,200
They have their reasons.

68
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,700
But that's what happened
to the manuscript.

69
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,710
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

70
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,510
It's a manuscript, not a
referendum on your character.

71
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,140
No. I--

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,610
- In the books--
- So you lost it.

73
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,210
What do you do
when you lose something?

74
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,140
So you had it the whole time.

75
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,180
I don't know what you're
yapping about, as usual.

76
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,880
"Book Six."

77
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,180
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

78
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,980
Like I said, it wasn't me.

79
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,690
Want to get that thing
out of my face?

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,260
Ugh, fine.
I took the stupid thing.

81
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,190
I was bored.
It was there.

82
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,560
Now it's gone.

83
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,160
Gone?
What do you mean, it's gone?

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,430
I mean I read it.

85
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,770
I spilled my beer on it.

86
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,270
I tossed it in the trash,

87
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,940
and then I went
and got another beer.

88
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,740
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

89
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,040
Wait.
You said you read it.

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,540
- Do you--do you remember it?
- Ish.

91
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,380
This is important.
Okay, I need you--

92
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,080
I need to punch you
in the throat

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,780
if you tell me
what I need to do.

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,620
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

95
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,350
You've got the scars
to prove it.

96
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,590
I don't understand why
we can't just be basic allies.

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,360
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

98
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,060
more than you want to live.
I--

99
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,030
What did Plover say in the book?
Come on.

100
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,200
First of all,
what's-his-name didn't write it.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,610
Plover.
Christopher Plover.

102
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,440
The girl did.

103
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,080
Jane Chatwin.

104
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,810
Wrote "Book Six"?
Holy shit.

105
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,110
<i>Yeah, she started off by saying</i>

106
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,820
<i>that the other books are wrong</i>

107
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,650
<i>and she wanted to go back
and clarify some shit.</i>

108
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,250
Wrong in what way?

109
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,890
Um, this--this was
the summer that the mom died,

110
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,160
and they were hanging out
in Plover's mansion,

111
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,560
eating crumpets.

112
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,660
Right. Um...

113
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,970
<i>Jane and Martin opened a closet,</i>

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,270
<i>and they went to Fillory.</i>

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,000
No. Martin didn't go.

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,310
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

117
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,140
- Forgetting him?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,440
Martin was crying
like a little bitch

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,140
about Fillory
not wanting him anymore,

120
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,280
and Jane said hang tight
and she'll find some way

121
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,920
that Martin can go back
to Fillory anytime he wanted.

122
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,850
<i>Yeah, and there were,
like, creatures or something.</i>

123
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,320
<i>Questing Creature--
if you catch one,</i>

124
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,090
they're forced
to grant you a wish.

125
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,760
There's seven of them.
There's a dog, a rabbit--

126
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,620
Stop!

127
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,130
I'm literally becoming less cool
with every word you speak.

128
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,860
<i>So I assume she had
her enchanted bow</i>

129
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,660
so that she could
actually get one.

130
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,530
Uh...

131
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,370
Yes, right. Yes.

132
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,440
Stop, or I'll shoot.

133
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,270
Hello, human child.

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,340
<i>It was a dog.</i>

135
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,810
I need a key
to unlock the door to Fillory.

136
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,980
- I caught you, dog.
<i>- No, wait.</i>

137
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,950
Not a dog.

138
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,050
It was a pig.

139
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,990
By decree of Ember and Umber,

140
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,520
you must give me what I ask.

141
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Wrong. No.
What was it?

142
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,220
- Back up.
- Ah, for fuck sake.

143
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,790
Hello, human child.

144
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,330
I caught you.

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,660
Give me what I ask.

146
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,860
Did it work?

147
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,800
As you wish, so shall it be.

148
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,070
Wait.
So the button is the key?

149
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,210
- Well, this all makes sense.
- It does?

150
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,750
In the last book,
Martin--

151
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,510
he's obsessed with finding
the lost button.

152
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,250
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

153
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,190
The message boards are insane,
um, with different theories,

154
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,320
because the books--they just say
that the button's magic.

155
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,190
They don't--they don't--
nothing specific about it.

156
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,730
- Oh, this is huge.
- Why is this huge?

157
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,730
Because it could still
be there at Plover's house.

158
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,900
Martin never found it.
We could--

159
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,440
Whoa, you are talking
about a direct ticket

160
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,770
to The fucking Beast.

161
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,570
Better than him
having one to us.

162
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,380
Look, this is in a manuscript
that you're probably

163
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,450
the only person
to have ever read.

164
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,350
There's a chance
the button's still there.

165
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,380
I'm going,

166
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
and like it or not,
Penny, you should come.

167
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm coming too.

168
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,890
Okay.

169
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,360
So what's the quickest way
to England?

170
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Ooh, Penny, do you--

171
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,370
Dick.

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,950
Great.
I'll--I'll pack.

173
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,820
- To where?
- Uh...

175
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,590
Scurry along, Ronald.

176
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,820
Raymond.

177
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,790
Raymond.
Have a great day.

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,930
Uh...
So you seem good.

179
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,630
Could use a top-up.

180
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,510
So where are you
flying off to, exactly?

181
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,240
Uh, England.

182
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,610
Oh, you don't need a plane.

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,150
Margo and I made a door directly
to our favorite pub.

184
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,320
You can get to where
you need to go from there.

185
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,120
I'll show you if you take me.

186
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,820
Margo's still in Ibiza.

187
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,520
Ronald gives terrible head.

188
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,790
It's not his fault.
TMJ.

189
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,530
I'm bored.

190
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,430
- You don't even know what--
- I'll catch up.

191
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,940
How are you today, Keira?
I brought a friend.

192
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,980
I've been working on
that thing we talked about.

193
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,950
Julia's here to help.
You want to lock the door?

194
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,890
Yeah.

195
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,630
Keira, I want you to think
of somewhere that you love.

196
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,200
We're going to create that place
together in your mind.

197
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,000
She can hear us, right?

198
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,740
Julia's gonna meet you there.

199
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,870
She's experienced
in mental projection.

200
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,140
I wouldn't call it a specialty.

201
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,380
If anything goes pear-shaped,
I'll pull you right back.

202
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,250
Richard?

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Keira?

204
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,790
Hello?

205
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,760
Richard, I'm stuck!
Someone get me out of here!

206
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,280
We screwed up.

207
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,550
Someone saw "Kill Bill."

208
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,050
Keira, Keira,

209
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,560
if you don't want me in here,
then just let me go.

210
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,260
I know shit Uma didn't know...

211
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,260
Like how to become
impervious to fire,

212
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,230
so I will walk
right out of here.

213
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,750
Are you Richard's friend?

214
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,320
What the hell was that?

215
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,660
Needed to see
if you were any good

216
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,090
before I let you near me.

217
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,730
What is it with Magicians
and tests?

218
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,730
Here.
You need a pen.

219
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,500
Did Richard tell you who I am?

220
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,240
Just that you're
extremely smart.

221
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,640
I can barely comprehend this.

222
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,740
Can you tell it doesn't work?

223
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,250
There was an answer.
I could feel it.

224
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,780
I couldn't get there.
Then my body turned on me.

225
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,250
- How long have you--
- Year.

226
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,320
But I still have this.

227
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,130
So I sat and did the rest of it.

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,000
You finished this in your mind?

229
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,300
I talk. You write.

230
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,300
And when you go back out,
remember what you wrote.

231
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,970
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Um...

233
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,110
Fire at will.

234
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay.
So we start pretty simply.

235
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,550
The framework from Popper 45.

236
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,780
Okay.

237
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,120
<i>This estate has been
in the Plover family</i>

238
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,860
<i>for five generations.</i>

239
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,290
Christopher Plover, already
a prolific and respected author,

240
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,460
was looking for inspiration
for his new book

241
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,070
when Jane Martin
and Rupert Chatwin

242
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,570
moved in next door.

243
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,370
- Not exactly.
- Excuse me?

244
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Question from the back.

245
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,910
No, not a question,
more of a correction.

246
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,580
The kids got there first,
Jane and Martin,

247
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,510
and then Rupert got injured.

248
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,980
Ah, we have ourselves an expert.

249
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,190
- Now--
- And Plover's previous work,

250
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,350
uh, he--well, he only got
rejections for it.

251
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,860
It just didn't really
show the depth

252
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,590
of the "Fillory and Further"
series.

253
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,430
Stay closer.

254
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,230
I'm not sure I can
do this tour without you.

255
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,200
Now we have some pictures
of the Plover family.

256
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,270
Plover's sister Prudence

257
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,070
cared for him until
his untimely death in 1952.

258
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,940
Stay with the group, please.

259
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,010
Not all rooms
are for public viewing.

260
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,080
Prudence said Christopher
so understood children

261
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,450
because of his own
tragic childhood.

262
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,750
He aided many families
in the area

263
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,060
and paid for the education
of his housekeeper's children,

264
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,090
George and Beatrix.

265
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,630
Not only did he write
for the Chatwins,

266
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,030
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

267
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,600
Legend has it Jane
walked through a closet

268
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,100
in this very house
to get to Fillory.

269
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,640
Follow me to the writing room.

270
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,290
This is where Fillory was born,

271
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,290
where Plover told tales
to Jane and Martin.

272
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,800
As Plover wrote,
"There is no substitute

273
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,000
for a childhood of adventure,

274
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,470
warmth, and love."

275
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,140
You will never be a man.

276
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,510
All right,
let's find this button

277
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,140
and get out of here.

278
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,920
Shall we proceed,
criminal element?

279
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,490
This is where he wrote it,

280
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,930
right here.

281
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,630
This desk saved my life.

282
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,170
So I liked the books
when I was a kid,

283
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,540
and my friend Julia and I,

284
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,840
we'd pretend to be
Jane and Martin and...

285
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,140
So I was 16 the first time
I was hospitalized.

286
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,810
I just--I couldn't get
out of bed, like, at all.

287
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,280
I didn't know that.

288
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,720
My brain breaks sometimes.

289
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,990
And my dad brought me the books,
and I read them,

290
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,660
and I felt enough
like me to at least

291
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,860
try to get back
in the game, you know?

292
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,360
Do you still feel like that?

293
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,560
Broken brain?

294
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,500
I feel like...

295
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,970
I don't feel
that it really fixes.

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,070
It just works better now

297
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,240
in its own screwed up way.

298
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,480
Hey, would you break up
with me if I told you

299
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,710
that I've never been happier
in my entire life?

300
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,320
Guys, stop lovebirding and look.

301
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,910
Boring, boring...

302
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,370
- Completely boring.
- Hey, this could be something.

303
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,020
It's a letter
from Prudence, his sister,

304
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,620
to their lawyer.

305
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,350
Plover died
of a heart attack in 1952,

306
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,290
but this is all about
how he's missing, not dead.

307
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,690
She wants a death
certificate issued.

308
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,930
Whoa.

309
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,100
Holy shit.
They lied.

310
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,600
Why would she lie if the--

311
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,030
Rumors about Plover.

312
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,240
He--there are these kids
that were missing--

313
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,640
kids that knew Plover,

314
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,140
and in his absence,
people were talking,

315
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,780
and the longer that
they stayed vanished,

316
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,910
the more people started
connecting them in a bad way.

317
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,220
No, I bet it's more
complicated than that, right?

318
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,250
Well, because--because
Fillory is actually real.

319
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,990
Exactly, and Plover was crushed

320
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,560
that the Chatwins were missing,

321
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,290
because he knew exactly
where they went.

322
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,890
I love a good cover-up.

323
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,630
And the books
were already getting famous,

324
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,630
so maybe it was easier
just to say he died, I guess.

325
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,800
So what happened to him?

326
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,500
I got a theory.

327
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,240
McCabe, Livingston, Ali, Popper.

328
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,510
Oh, my God.

329
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,580
- He was studying magic.
- Yeah.

330
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,450
I guess that never made it
to the message boards.

331
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,580
But check this out.

332
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,320
Kaminsky, Umar,

333
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,150
Aurora.

334
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,950
I've never even heard of those.

335
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,490
Of course, you haven't.
You're not a traveler.

336
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,990
It's the entire 101.

337
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,160
- Plover was a traveler?
- Or he wanted to be.

338
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,330
I mean, you go one inch wrong,

339
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,600
you're torn to shreds.

340
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,860
This is amazing.

341
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,200
- What if--
- Try this.

342
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,370
Plover's an idiot, like you,

343
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,870
who wanted to go
to Fillory, like you,

344
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,940
so he tries a spell
and gets blown up.

345
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,150
Or it worked.

346
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,350
Fantastic to idiots.

347
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,290
You want some?
It never empties.

348
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,220
Trapped here. Help us.

349
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,850
Trapped here.
Help us.

350
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,020
- Alice--
- Shh.

351
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,990
Don't you hear that?

352
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,730
What in God's name
are you doing?

353
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,200
You set off the alarms. You have
to get out of here this instant.

354
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,570
Okay. Look.

355
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,740
Is this something that
can be fixed with money?

356
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,040
But you're not listening.

357
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,170
Are you mad, or are you scared?

358
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,270
You shouldn't be here
at night, so please--

359
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,910
What really happened to Plover?

360
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,180
I don't know what
you're talking about.

361
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,850
Yes, you do.

362
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,110
Ugh, he's so panicked,

363
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,250
I can't make sense
of anything he's thinking.

364
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,990
Okay.
Enough of this.

365
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,390
I'm a super villain.

366
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,730
- Now talk.
- Okay.

367
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,260
But then we need to go.

368
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,700
Plover--what was
the real deal?

369
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,530
He was involved
in some dark things.

370
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,970
There's a book.
It's hidden in the writing room.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,150
Yeah.
I think we found it.

372
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,040
Prudence--she didn't
want anyone to know

373
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,370
the unnatural things
that her brother--

374
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,110
Oh, no!

375
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,040
- Oh, my God.
- Where did they go?

376
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,420
Whoa.

377
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,390
Okay, then.

378
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,230
Let's get the fuck out of here.

379
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,330
All in favor?

380
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,350
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

381
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,720
Penny.

382
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,020
Alice and Eliot.

383
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,890
Fuck me.

384
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,340
So where did Richard find you?

385
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,410
Brakebills?

386
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,340
Rehab.

387
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

388
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,750
I, uh...didn't go
to school for this.

389
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
You sound bitter.

390
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,520
You caught that.

391
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,080
You know, I didn't
go to school either.

392
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,850
Come on.

393
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,590
Well, I went to MIT,

394
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,490
but I didn't study
a lick of magic in school.

395
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,930
- This is brilliant.
- Magic is science.

396
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,760
Hard to crack on your own,

397
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,330
but far from impossible,
if you have the natural bent.

398
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,470
Yeah.

399
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,340
You know, sometimes,
I wonder if I do...

400
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,170
have it naturally.

401
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,540
What if it's all
just one big party trick

402
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,810
that never adds up to anything?

403
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,180
So?
What if it doesn't?

404
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,520
You know what I think
about when I'm in here?

405
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,990
This one day in this park
with my girlfriend.

406
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,390
We sat here in the rain

407
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,300
doing this dumb little spell
over and over,

408
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,900
making a rainbow
that lasted ten seconds.

409
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,240
Sounds lovely.

410
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,840
It was.

411
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,140
Best day of my life.

412
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,240
What's yours?

413
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,910
Here.

414
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,480
While you and Richard
are juicing me up, show me.

415
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,890
I was ten
with my friend Quentin.

416
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,230
No one bothered us under here.
It was like we were invisible.

417
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,000
We'd read "Fillory" books
for hours.

418
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,260
I loved those.

419
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,600
One day, we made this

420
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,670
like we were gonna go visit.

421
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,110
We were playing,
but it felt real.

422
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,350
See this.

423
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,350
Chase this.

424
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,220
It's the secret
to how to be you.

425
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,760
Okay. Back to the park.

426
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,860
Let's finish this puppy.

427
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,560
Alice?

428
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,430
Eliot?

429
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,900
- Alice!
- Chill, man.

430
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,270
They can handle themselves.

431
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,370
Shh, shh!

432
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,970
What the hell was that?

433
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,480
This house is haunted
as balls, is what that is.

434
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,750
Come in here, please.

435
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,130
Okay...

436
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,630
Hello?

437
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,800
Anyone or anything?

438
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,850
Okay, Jesus, we get it.

439
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,020
There are ghosts in here.

440
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,960
I tag you.

441
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,930
You're it.

442
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,370
What just happened?

443
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,470
I tag you.
You're it.

444
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,440
Do we go with this?

445
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,550
What other option do we have?

446
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,210
Okay, this is a little kinky,
even for me.

447
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,480
Would you care for refreshment?

448
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,410
Oh, um, okay, sure.
Sounds divine.

449
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,520
Mmm. Okay.

450
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,390
Thank you.

451
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,720
We must get these things
off our hands.

452
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,220
Do you know Popper 29 yet?

453
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,890
No magic in the house.

454
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,230
Be good, or she'll take you
to the quiet place.

455
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,000
We'll be good.
Right, Eliot?

456
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,600
Mm, yeah, you're the boss, kid.

457
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,840
She's coming.

458
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,750
Stop doing that.

459
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,360
My brother is too soft,

460
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,760
caring for you when he
needs peace to work.

461
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,240
He has no idea
how naughty you truly are.

462
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,470
Now drink your tea.

463
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,080
Drink it.

464
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,130
No.
I'm over here.

465
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,080
Holy shit,
that's Christopher Plover.

466
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,610
Is it just me,
or does it feel like

467
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,020
we're being shown something,
like how it was?

468
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,980
Yeah, the time slip.

469
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,750
You say that like,
"Yeah, a sunrise."

470
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,790
Sunderland talks
about it all the time.

471
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,360
She has a PhD in hauntings.

472
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,120
Her favorite thing
about a haunted house is,

473
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,660
you get these ghost movies
of the past running on a loop.

474
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,530
You see shit like it was.

475
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,830
I didn't know any of that.

476
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,160
Of course not.
You're an idiot.

477
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,100
Oh, my God, it's her.

478
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,840
It's a tiny chick in a beret.

479
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,940
Slow down, Jane.

480
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,040
That's Jane and Martin
from the books.

481
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,180
- Nerdgasm.
- This makes sense.

482
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,980
Plover took them in,
and they spent their days

483
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,550
playing with
the housekeeper's kids.

484
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,050
Martin--he was, like,
really sick that summer--

485
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,980
Martin, hurry!

486
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,150
Janey, wait for me.

487
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,450
Wait, no.
I'm coming with you.

488
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,530
Why won't you take me?

489
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Ember, Umber, why won't you
let me in anymore?

490
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,140
I try to be good.

491
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,840
Martin, are you all right?

492
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,180
Where's Jane?

493
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,140
Fillory.

494
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,350
What's wrong with me?

495
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,650
Nothing.

496
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,350
Some things just aren't fair.

497
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,050
We can't make sense of them.

498
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,690
Let's have tea, hmm?
Come on.

499
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,760
Us left-behinds
ought to stick together.

500
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,230
She's coming.
We need to hide.

501
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,830
Quentin?

502
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,770
Okay, I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

503
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,740
What did I tell you children

504
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,280
about disturbing
Mr. Plover?

505
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,520
Great.

506
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,690
No talking in the quiet place.

507
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,030
Lady, I don't know
who you think I am, but--

508
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,930
Insolent is what you are.

509
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,540
I've told you I'll sew it shut.

510
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,940
Alice.

511
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,290
Hey, hey, we need to hustle.

512
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,190
Mrs. Danvers could come back.

513
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,690
Oh, my God.

514
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,360
Do you know what this is?

515
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,760
A vaguely whimsical horror show?

516
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
She did this.

517
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,270
She really did this to
the children--Plover's sister.

518
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,600
She tied them up
and drugged them

519
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
so that they wouldn't
disturb his work.

520
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,810
Okay, well, maybe ghost girl
can tell us where the button is.

521
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,240
Hey, Beatrix?

522
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,410
Beatrix, hey.

523
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,580
My tummy feels bad.

524
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,980
Beatrix, it's okay.

525
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
- How can we help her?
- I don't think we can.

526
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,590
Well, I guess we know
how she died.

527
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,460
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

528
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,060
It's okay.
It's over.

529
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,470
It's been over for a long time.

530
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,930
No, no, no, no.
Not for her.

531
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,640
She just keeps reliving it
over and over.

532
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,670
- We have to--
- We have to go.

533
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,610
We have to go.

534
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,140
It's not the same.

535
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,410
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

536
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,650
Here, have another.

537
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,420
Hmm.

538
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,650
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

539
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,190
Oh, shall we work a little?

540
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,520
I think that might be nice.

541
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,760
Do you think that might be nice?

542
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,930
Martin, Mr. Plover,
I'm back.

543
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,300
I was in Fillory.

544
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,000
Martin, I brought you
what you asked for.

545
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,870
- You must have a look.
- We'll be right back, sir.

546
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,010
She's dragging mud
all over the floor.

547
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,680
Stop that.
You're pinching me.

548
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,180
- You've got it?
- Yes.

549
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,210
Let's go show Mr. Plover.

550
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,650
No, please.
Let's not.

551
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,020
For me.

552
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,550
The button's a key.

553
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,130
I know you're here.

554
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,690
I know you're spying on us.

555
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,160
George, come out.

556
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,740
Take this.

557
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,400
It's a game, George.

558
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,040
How well can you
hide the button?

559
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,650
All right.

560
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,020
Well, I--I won't forget
any of it, so...

561
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,090
I know you won't.

562
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,660
Can I give you a little
advice in return?

563
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,520
- Yeah.
- Forget that school.

564
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,990
The world never did help
a smart girl.

565
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,490
Why would it?

566
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,760
We scare the shit
out of the world.

567
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,870
If the world goes after you,
take it as a compliment.

568
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,210
You know, I could come back.
We could--we could do more.

569
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,850
- This was really the big one.
- No, I know.

570
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,510
I just--I just--you know,
I'm sure you have more things--

571
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,020
I do need one other thing.

572
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,080
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

573
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,590
Kill me.

574
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,560
That's--that's crazy.

575
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,290
I'm allowed to be done.

576
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,300
- No. I can't.
- Well, I need you to.

577
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,600
You knew.

578
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,240
You knew, and you did--

579
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,570
No, I did not sign up for this.

580
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,210
Then what?
Pleasantries?

581
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
No, how about
not killing anyone?

582
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,040
What do you think redemption
looks like, Julia?

583
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,410
Being nice?
Donating shoes to Africa?

584
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,150
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

585
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,890
What if she's wrong?

586
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,950
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

587
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,590
What if there really is a hell
and this takes me there?

588
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,230
You're already in hell.
So is she.

589
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,800
What am I supposed to do?

590
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,200
Whichever's hardest.

591
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,950
Oh, thank you.

592
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,120
Drink up, Jane, and eat.

593
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,120
You must be famished.

594
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,630
Jane, don't you want to join us?

595
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,170
Oh, she's tired.

596
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,810
That's all right.

597
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,850
You go ahead, Martin,
like last time.

598
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,150
I don't know if I want to.

599
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,020
Remember when I took
you and your sister

600
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,790
to town for cinema?

601
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,620
Bought her that dress
she wanted.

602
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,890
Yes.
We're grateful.

603
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,960
When I was a boy,

604
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,530
I didn't have anyone
who thought about me.

605
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,700
I saw it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

606
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,340
I care about you, Martin.

607
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,310
Come on, in front of the camera.

608
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,750
Give me a smile.

609
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,650
Mm.

610
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,850
Oh, I have the best news.

611
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,750
I am so close
to figuring it all out.

612
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,190
Wild magic,

613
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,030
too strong to do
with human hands.

614
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,560
I'd have to grow another finger.

615
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,930
Can you imagine?

616
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,730
Of course, there's
spellwork for that too,

617
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,370
if I can master it.

618
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,070
All right, you can go ahead
and take that off now.

619
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,330
Trousers too, darling.
All of it.

620
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,100
I think the solution
to all our problems

621
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,040
lies in Fillory.

622
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,800
I need to go there with you.

623
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,270
- But--
- I know.

624
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,640
It's been for you kids.

625
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,640
But I think we could
find a way to go.

626
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,950
We could be together.

627
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,380
You're a lovely boy, Martin.

628
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,590
Now turn around.

629
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,430
They play like that
all the time.

630
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,260
A whole pile of naughty pictures

631
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,730
hidden in the dictionary.

632
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,970
Oh, no.
The mean lady.

633
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,400
- Little spy!
- I didn't see anything!

634
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,900
- I swear.
- May God punish you.

635
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,010
- My brother is a good man.
- No.

636
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,580
You all hound him.
It's your fault.

637
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,680
Stop.
Leave him alone.

638
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,020
Hmm.

639
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,320
To the quiet place,

640
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,160
for the best.

641
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,790
- We should go back in there.
- Shh.

642
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,010
I'm trying to think,
and I'm out of cigarettes.

643
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,050
This is dire.

644
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,550
Oh, my God.
You're okay.

645
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,250
We're great.
We're both great, actually.

646
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,820
Where's Penny?

647
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,490
Knowing him, Disneyland by now.

648
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,930
What if he got to Fillory?

649
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,860
What did he do to Martin?

650
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,760
What are you talking about?

651
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,740
I saw something
in there--

652
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,370
who Plover really was,

653
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,410
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

654
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,050
What...was he doing?

655
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,420
Oh, God.

656
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,020
The poor kid, he was just trying

657
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,750
to get a button to Fillory,

658
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,560
you know, so he could escape
this monster, who, by the way,

659
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,190
generations of idiots like me
have been worshiping

660
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,530
like a literary god...

661
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,570
who was...learning magic

662
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,240
to get stronger, to travel,

663
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,540
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

664
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Grow fingers?
Like--

665
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,450
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

666
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,220
What if he went there
because he had access

667
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,820
via these kids who he liked
to tell stories to

668
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,060
when he wasn't drugging
and raping them?

669
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,820
Jesus.

670
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,930
Well, I still have
the capacity to be surprised.

671
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,300
We thought you ditched us.

672
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,770
What happened to you?

673
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,970
Man, I traveled into
a fuck tree about a mile off,

674
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,170
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

675
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,510
Not so precise
with the travel, huh?

676
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,980
Shut up.

677
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,910
Wait, what do you mean, dungeon?

678
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,280
I mean some
dirt-floor basement

679
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,980
bitch calls the quiet place,

680
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,580
'cause that's not
fuck psychotic.

681
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,520
There's a storm cellar
around the back.

682
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,120
That's where she took
the housekeeper's kid.

683
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,260
He's got the button
in his pocket.

684
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,190
- Let's go.
- Whoa.

685
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,530
That's a great idea if you want
Prudence to grab us immediately.

686
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,790
- Dislike.
- Okay.

687
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,600
I know what to do about her.

688
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,200
Give me a ten-minute head start,
and then head to the cellar.

689
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,780
What are you doing
out of the playroom?

690
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,680
This is going well.

691
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,150
- Where the hell's Quentin?
- He's coming.

692
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,880
You're all going
to the quiet place.

693
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,780
Hey, Prudence!

694
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,820
I heard the nastiest rumor

695
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,320
about your brother.

696
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,990
Okay, fine, but there are
about 48 more of those

697
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,960
that I just hid
all over the house.

698
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,290
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows exactly

699
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,530
what Christopher Plover did.

700
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,630
No.

701
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,500
Okay.

702
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,470
Well, that bought us
about ten minutes.

703
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,140
Let's go dig up a dead body.

704
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,080
It's done.

705
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,520
Richard and I,
we--

706
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,920
So this is what that's like.

707
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,950
Do you want me to stay?

708
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,660
So you're found
meditating in my room

709
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,780
next to my overdosed corpse?

710
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,660
Yeah, well, when you
put it like that...

711
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,480
Bye, Julia.

712
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,280
Have a good life.

713
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,060
We'd better go.

714
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,070
Quentin.

715
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,010
We have to go back.

716
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,110
- Come on.
- We have to go back, Quentin.

717
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,220
And do what, exactly?

718
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,580
Help those children.

719
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,250
You can't seriously be thinking
of leaving them there.

720
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,720
They were there
before we were born.

721
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,890
Trapped.

722
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,190
This is exactly
the kind of thing

723
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,360
that we should be able to fix.

724
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,460
There are ways
to clear a haunted house.

725
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,800
The house, yes.

726
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,570
It doesn't help with the ghosts.

727
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,900
There are rituals
in every civilization.

728
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,540
To prevent this, not reverse it.

729
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,910
We have to help them.

730
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
There has to be something.

731
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,380
Those kids--
they did nothing.

732
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,110
That is so unfair.

733
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,420
- You don't say.
- You're not helping.

734
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,890
I'm the only one helping.

735
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,890
Life ain't fair.

736
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,890
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

737
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,630
Thinking that you can
change anything--

738
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,160
it's such an act
of monumental ego.

739
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,000
I mean, who the fuck
do you think you really are?

740
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,900
I mean, you're just some
arrogant, little twat.

741
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,540
- So suck it up.
- Shut the fuck up.

742
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,240
Vix,

743
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,150
if we're gonna go, we got to go.

744
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,520
Okay.

745
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,650
Come on.

746
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:09,340
Thanks, but I'm okay.

747
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,610
No, you're not.

748
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,320
Okay, I'm not.

749
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,620
Are you okay?

750
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,620
No.

751
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,360
I've been freaked about The
Beast since that day, you know?

752
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,200
I've been worried about myself,

753
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,900
and now that we know
who he is, what he is,

754
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,210
what he did to those kids,
Martin, I just...

755
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,910
I want to kill him, you know?

756
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,540
I want to--I want to step
through the nearest clock,

757
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,210
and I want to wring his neck.

758
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,310
Okay.

759
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,850
Let's see this button.

760
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,530
It looks so ordinary.

761
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,060
No, I feel something
coming off of it...

762
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,330
hard.

763
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,670
You guys really don't feel that?

764
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,110
Maybe you should put it away.

765
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,180
Hey, don't talk to me
like I'm you.

766
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,110
Mayakovsky trained me himself.

767
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,720
I stay put until
I want to go, period.

768
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,290
Told him not to do that.
