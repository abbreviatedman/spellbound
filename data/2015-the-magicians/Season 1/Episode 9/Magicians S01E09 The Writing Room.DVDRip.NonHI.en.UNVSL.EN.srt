1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,412
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>It is The Beast, isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,981
<i>And he's from
Fillory, which is real.</i>

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,337
Want to know what
The Beast wants?

5
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,846
He wants control of Fillory
and all the doors that lead there.

6
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,310
<i>I gave you a book about it.</i>

7
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,174
Stuff they're saying I
did, I don't remember.

8
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,113
Were you blacked
out when we met?

9
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:19,176
We need something or someone to
lean on that is bigger than ourselves.

10
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,983
<i>- What was that?
- Did it work?</i>

11
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,750
More energy than I've ever felt.

12
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,260
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,627
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,932
She is the only one who
can actually give me answers.

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,336
There are no answers,

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,536
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,978
<i>Dear Q,</i>

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,019
<i>I don't need to tell you how
fucking pissed at you I am.</i>

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,678
<i>Probably got the
message around the time</i>

20
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>I incepted the shit out of you.</i>

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,885
<i>I don't understand why we fell
apart after being friends forever.</i>

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,660
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part.
I never meant to really hurt you.</i>

23
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,332
<i>I put it down. I got help.</i>

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,779
<i>I know you're not
supposed to say</i>

25
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,669
<i>the other person fucked up, too,</i>

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,003
<i>but you fucked up, too.</i>

27
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:19,169
<i>And it broke us, and I hate you
for that, because I really miss us, Q.</i>

28
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,209
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

29
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,409
<i>Jules.</i>

30
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,884
<i>J, got your letter.</i>

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,586
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

32
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,125
<i>But I'm glad you're
okay. I really am.</i>

33
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,417
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

34
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,031
<i>It's not black and white, Julia.</i>

35
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,004
It's all I thought about all
day when I was in there,

36
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,941
and it's all that I think
about now that I'm out.

37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,674
Well, there's this sometimes
very handy thing called "penance."

38
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,340
What, like 50 magic lashes?

39
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,086
That spell you used

40
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,232
to get inside your friend's
mind, do you remember it?

41
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,782
That's a perfect
example of something

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,019
that can be used to
help instead of hurt.

43
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,653
If you're not afraid
to do the work...

44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,992
I'm not.

45
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,724
Okay.

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,894
Q?

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,607
You can't sleep?

48
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,104
I just, uh...

49
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,347
Eliza gave me the answer,
apparently, and I lost it.

50
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,047
<i>Fillory and Further,</i> book six.

51
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,420
It was important,
and it just vanished.

52
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,386
So did you look for it?

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,655
Yeah, of course.
Everywhere. I...

54
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:46,997
Fillory is always deciding
when to let the Chatwins go

55
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,671
and deciding when
to kick them out,

56
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,205
because Ember and Umber...

57
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,831
Right, twin gods of Fillory.

58
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,747
They get mean and take
everything away, I know.

59
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,378
Essentially, yeah.
They have their reasons.

60
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,746
But that's what happened
in the manuscript.

61
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,713
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

62
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,512
It's a manuscript, not a
referendum on your character.

63
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,783
No. I...

64
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,590
In the books... So you lost it.

65
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,217
What do you do when
you lose something?

66
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,143
So you had it the whole time.

67
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,364
I don't know what you're
yapping about, as usual.

68
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,822
Book six.

69
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,290
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

70
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,020
Like I said, it wasn't me.

71
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,658
Want to get that
thing out of my face?

72
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,091
Fine. I took the stupid thing.

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,465
I was bored. It was there.

74
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,568
Now it's gone.

75
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,041
"Gone?" What do
you mean, it's gone?

76
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,610
I mean I read it,

77
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,307
I spilled my beer on it,
I tossed it in the trash,

78
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,939
and then I went
and got another beer.

79
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,883
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

80
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,478
Wait. You said you read
it. Do you remember it?

81
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,522
Ish.

82
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,388
This is important.
Okay, I need you...

83
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,120
I need to punch
you in the throat

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,956
if you tell me
what I need to do.

85
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,573
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

86
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,031
You've got the
scars to prove it.

87
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,933
I don't understand why
we can't just be basic allies.

88
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,379
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

89
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,338
more than you want to live.

90
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,807
What did Plover say
in the book? Come on.

91
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,341
First of all, what's-his-name
didn't write it.

92
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,482
Plover. Christopher Plover.

93
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:48,044
The girl did. Jane Chatwin.

94
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,850
Wrote book six? Holy shit.

95
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,188
<i>Yeah, she started off by saying</i>

96
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,303
<i>that the other books were wrong,</i>

97
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,660
<i>and she wanted to go
back and clarify some shit.</i>

98
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,822
Wrong in what way?

99
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,868
Um, this was the
summer that the mom died,

100
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:05,599
and they were hanging out in
Plover's mansion, eating crumpets.

101
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,136
Right, um...

102
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,269
<i>Jane and Martin opened a
closet, and they went to Fillory.</i>

103
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,012
No. Martin didn't go.

104
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,341
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

105
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,817
"Forgetting him"?

106
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,429
Yeah. Martin was
crying like a little bitch

107
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,183
about Fillory not
wanting him anymore,

108
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,453
and Jane said, "Hang tight,"
and she'll find some way

109
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,926
that Martin can go back to
Fillory anytime he wanted.

110
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,939
<i>I dunno, there were, like,
creatures or something.</i>

111
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,240
Questing Creature.
If you catch one,

112
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,508
they're forced to
grant you a wish.

113
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,777
There's seven of them.
There's a, uh, uh, dog, a rabbit...

114
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,962
Stop!

115
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,129
I'm literally becoming less
cool with every word you speak.

116
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,732
So, I assume she, uh,
had her enchanted bow,

117
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,674
uh, so that she
could actually get one.

118
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,302
Uh...

119
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,409
Yes, right. Yes.

120
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,107
Stop, or I'll shoot.

121
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,053
Hello, human child.

122
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,246
It <i>was a dog.</i>

123
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,186
I need a key to unlock
the door to Fillory.

124
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,254
I caught you, dog.

125
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,795
No, wait. Not a dog.

126
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,052
It was a pig.

127
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,489
By decree of Ember and Umber,
you must give me what I ask.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,865
Wrong. No. What was it? Back up.

129
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,198
For fuck's sake.

130
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,131
Hello, human child.

131
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,606
I caught you.
Give me what I ask.

132
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,934
Did it work?

133
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,735
As you wish, so shall it be.

134
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,317
<i>Wait.</i>

135
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,087
So, the button is the key?

136
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,986
Well, this all makes sense.

137
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,318
It does?

138
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,656
In the last book, Martin, he's
obsessed with finding the lost button.

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,837
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

140
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,196
The message boards are
insane, um, with different theories,

141
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,310
because the books... They
just say that the button's magic.

142
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,361
They don't... Nothing
specific about it.

143
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,996
This is huge.

144
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,664
Why is this huge?

145
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,770
Because it could still be
there at Plover's house.

146
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,207
Martin never found it.

147
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,469
We could...

148
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,778
You are talking about a direct
ticket to The fucking Beast.

149
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,614
Better than him
having one to us.

150
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,515
Look, this is in a manuscript

151
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,217
that you're probably the
only person to have ever read.

152
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,320
There's a chance
the button's still there.

153
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,392
I'm going, and like it or not,
Penny, you should come.

154
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,193
I'm coming, too.

155
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,093
Okay.

156
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,197
So, what's the quickest
way to England?

157
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,031
Penny, do you...

158
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,467
Dick.

159
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,820
Uh, great. I'll pack.

160
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,303
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

161
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,454
To where?

162
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,728
Uh...

163
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,660
Scurry along, Ronald.

164
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,858
Raymond.

165
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,126
Raymond.

166
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,794
Have a great day.

167
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,773
Um...

168
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,942
So, you seem good.

169
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,003
Could use a top-up.

170
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,080
So, where are you
flying off to, exactly?

171
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,545
Uh, England.

172
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:07,953
Oh?

173
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,615
You don't need a plane.

174
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,352
Margo and I made a door
directly to our favorite pub.

175
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,417
You can get to where
you need to go from there.

176
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,087
I'll show you, if you take me.

177
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,496
Margo's still in Ibiza,
Ronald gives terrible head.

178
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,729
It's not his fault. TMJ.

179
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm bored.

180
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,836
You don't even
know... I'll catch up.

181
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,984
How are you today, Kira?

182
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,813
I brought a friend.

183
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,513
I've been

184
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,492
working on that
thing we talked about.

185
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,756
Julia's here to help.

186
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,057
You want to lock the door?

187
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,221
Yeah.

188
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,432
Kira, I want you to think of
somewhere that you love.

189
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:02,170
We're going to create that
place together in your mind.

190
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,001
She can hear us, right?

191
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,741
Julia's gonna meet you there.

192
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,245
She's experienced
in mental projection.

193
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,111
I wouldn't call it a specialty.

194
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,385
Look, if anything goes
pear-shaped, I'll pull you right back.

195
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,120
Richard?

196
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,726
Kira?

197
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,989
Hello?

198
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,065
Richard!

199
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,830
I'm stuck! Someone
get me out of here!

200
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,128
We screwed up badly.

201
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,696
We screwed up badly.

202
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,979
Someone saw <i>Kill Bill.</i>

203
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,415
Kira. Kira, if you don't want
me in here, then just let me go.

204
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,054
I know shit Uma didn't know.

205
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,223
Like how to become
impervious to fire,

206
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,096
so I will walk
right out of here.

207
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,721
Are you Richard's friend?

208
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,257
What the hell was that?

209
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,987
Needed to see if you were any
good before I let you near me.

210
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,522
What is it with
Magicians and tests?

211
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,321
Here. You need a pen.

212
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,098
Did Richard tell you who I am?

213
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,433
Just that you're
extremely smart.

214
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,705
I can barely comprehend this.

215
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,609
Can you tell it doesn't work?

216
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,012
There was an answer. I
could feel it. I couldn't get there.

217
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,347
Then my body turned on me.

218
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,453
How long have you... Year.

219
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,325
But I still have this.

220
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,792
So I sat and did the rest of it.

221
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,194
You finished this in your mind?

222
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,193
I talk. You write.

223
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,227
And when you go back out,
remember what you wrote.

224
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,932
Yeah, yeah. Um.

225
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,000
Fire at will.

226
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:55,673
Okay. So we start pretty simply.
The framework from Popper 45.

227
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,772
Okay.

228
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:06,257
This estate has been in the
Plover family for five generations.

229
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:10,161
Now, Christopher Plover, already
a prolific and respected author,

230
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,324
was looking for
inspiration for his new book

231
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,327
when Jane, Martin and Rupert
Chatwin moved in next door.

232
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,303
Not exactly. Excuse me?

233
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,395
Question from the back.

234
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,639
No, uh, uh not a question,
more of a correction.

235
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,608
The kids got there
first, Jane and Martin,

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
and then Rupert got injured.

237
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,679
Oh, so we have
ourselves an expert.

238
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,119
And Plover's previous work,

239
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,648
well, he only got
rejections for it.

240
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,901
It just didn't really
show the depth

241
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,484
of the <i>Fillory and
Further</i> series.

242
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,994
Stay close, sir.

243
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,121
I'm not sure I can do
this tour without you.

244
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,565
Now we have some
pictures of the Plover family.

245
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,200
Plover's sister, Prudence,

246
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,203
cared for him until his
untimely death in 1952.

247
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,871
Stay with the group, please.

248
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,914
Not all rooms are
for public viewing.

249
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,051
Prudence said Christopher
so understood children

250
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,712
because of his own
tragic childhood.

251
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,720
He aided many
families in the area.

252
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,157
He paid for the education of
his housekeeper's children,

253
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,024
George and Beatrix.

254
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,191
Not only did he
write for the Chatwins,

255
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,931
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

256
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,437
Legend has it, Jane
walked through a closet

257
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,531
in this very house
to get to Fillory.

258
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,973
Follow me to the writing room.

259
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,018
This is where Fillory was born,

260
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,190
where Plover told
tales to Jane and Martin.

261
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,692
As Plover wrote,
"There is no substitute

262
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,828
"for a childhood of
adventure, warmth, and love."

263
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,005
You will never be a man.

264
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,109
All right, let's find this
button and get out of here.

265
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,813
Shall we proceed,
criminal element?

266
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,192
This is where he
wrote it. Right here.

267
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,261
This desk saved my life.

268
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,800
So, I liked the books when I was
a kid, and my friend, Julia, and I,

269
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,603
we'd pretend to be
Jane and Martin and...

270
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,969
So, I was 16 the first
time I was hospitalized.

271
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,845
I just couldn't get
out of bed, like, at all.

272
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,143
I didn't know that.

273
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,313
My brain breaks sometimes.

274
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,449
And my dad brought me the
books, and I read them, and I felt...

275
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,592
enough like me to at least try to
get back in the game, you know?

276
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,624
Do you still feel like that?

277
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,999
Broken brain?

278
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,168
I feel like...

279
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,012
I don't feel that
it really fixes.

280
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,803
It just works better now
in its own screwed-up way.

281
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,939
Hey, would you break up with me

282
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,607
if I told you that I've never
been happier in my entire life?

283
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,747
Guys, stop
love-birding and look.

284
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,435
Boring.

285
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,968
Boring.

286
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,065
Completely boring.

287
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,342
Wait, this could be something.

288
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,682
It's a letter from Prudence,
his sister, to their lawyer.

289
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,448
Plover died of a
heart attack in 1952,

290
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,958
but this is all about how
he's missing, not dead.

291
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,819
She wants a death
certificate issued.

292
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,563
Whoa!

293
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,296
Holy shit. They lied.

294
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,665
Why would she lie if the...

295
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,135
Rumors about Plover.

296
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,663
There are these kids that were
missing, kids that knew Plover.

297
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,936
And in his absence,
people were talking,

298
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,171
and the longer that
they stayed vanished,

299
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,841
the more people started
connecting them in a bad way.

300
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,475
No, I bet it's more
complicated than that, right?

301
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,843
Well, because...

302
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,354
Because Fillory
is actually real.

303
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,950
Exactly, and Plover was crushed

304
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,459
that the Chatwins were missing,

305
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,325
because he knew
exactly where they went.

306
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,829
I love a good cover-up.

307
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,559
And the books were
already getting famous,

308
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:43,569
so maybe it was easier
just to say he died, I guess.

309
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,070
So what happened to him?

310
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,235
I got a theory.

311
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,532
McCabe,

312
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,170
Livingston, Ali, Popper.

313
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,674
Oh, my God.

314
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,044
He was studying magic.

315
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,345
Yeah. I guess that never
made it to the message boards.

316
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,645
But check this out.

317
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:02,678
Kaminsky, Umar, Aurora.

318
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,462
I've never even heard of those.

319
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,435
Of course you haven't.
You're not a Traveler.

320
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,893
It's the entire 101.

321
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,227
Plover was a Traveler?

322
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,402
Or he wanted to be.

323
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,490
I mean, you go one inch
wrong, you're torn to shreds.

324
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,932
This is amazing.

325
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,128
What if... PENNY: Try this.

326
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,835
Plover's an idiot, like you, who
wanted to go to Fillory, like you,

327
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,342
so he tries a spell
and gets blown up.

328
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,603
Or it worked.

329
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,141
Fantastic, to idiots.

330
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,150
You want some? It never empties.

331
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,719
<i>Trapped here. Help us.</i>

332
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,121
<i>Trapped here.</i>

333
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,990
Alice.

334
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,204
Shh... Don't you hear that?

335
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,422
What in God's
name are you doing?

336
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,410
You set off the alarms. You
have to get out of here this instant.

337
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,868
Okay. Look.

338
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,729
Is this something that
can be fixed with money?

339
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,273
But you're not listening.

340
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,002
Are you mad, or are you scared?

341
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,169
You shouldn't be here
at night, so please...

342
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,483
What really happened to Plover?

343
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,689
I don't know what
you're talking about.

344
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,713
Yes, you do.

345
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,349
Ugh!

346
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,382
He's so panicked, I can't make
sense of anything he's thinking.

347
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,978
Okay. Enough of this.

348
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,117
I'm a super-villain.

349
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,593
Now talk. GUIDE: Okay.

350
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,185
But then, we need to go.

351
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,322
Plover, what was the real deal?

352
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,468
He was involved
in some dark things.

353
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,013
There's a book. It's
hidden in the writing room.

354
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,096
Yeah. I think we found it.

355
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,682
Prudence, she didn't
want anyone to know

356
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,150
the unnatural things
that her brother...

357
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,198
Oh, no!

358
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,106
Oh, my God. Where did they go?

359
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,691
Whoa!

360
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,690
Okay, then.

361
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,800
Let's get the fuck out
of here. All in favor?

362
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,025
Yeah.

363
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,206
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

364
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,479
Penny!

365
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,743
Alice and Eliot.

366
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,376
Fuck me.

367
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,125
So, where did Richard
find you? Brakebills?

368
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,459
Rehab.

369
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,326
Really?

370
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,464
Yeah. I didn't go
to school for this.

371
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:04,863
You sound bitter.

372
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,162
You caught that.

373
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,833
You know, I didn't
go to school, either.

374
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,802
Come on.

375
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,938
Well, I went to MIT, but I didn't
study a lick of magic in school.

376
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,908
This is brilliant.

377
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,610
Magic is science.

378
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:19,991
Hard to crack on your own,

379
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,056
but far from impossible, if
you have the natural bent.

380
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,283
Yeah.

381
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,625
You know, sometimes,
I wonder if I do.

382
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,220
Have it naturally.

383
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,264
What if it's all just
one big party trick

384
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,573
that never adds up to anything?

385
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,161
So? What if it doesn't?

386
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,099
You know what I think
about when I'm in here?

387
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,337
This one day in this
park with my girlfriend.

388
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,981
We sat here in the rain, doing
this dumb little spell over and over,

389
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,612
making a rainbow
that lasted 10 seconds.

390
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,985
Sounds lovely.

391
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,250
It was.

392
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,721
Best day of my life.

393
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,465
What's yours?

394
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,326
Here.

395
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,168
While you and Richard
are juicing me up, show me.

396
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,641
I was 10, with my
friend, Quentin.

397
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,273
No one bothered us under here.

398
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,717
It was like we were invisible.
We'd read <i>Fillory</i> books for hours.

399
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,947
I love those.

400
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,182
One day, we made this.

401
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,391
Like we were gonna go visit.

402
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,828
We were playing,
but it felt real.

403
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,601
See this.

404
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,805
Chase this.

405
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,937
It's the secret
to how to be you.

406
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,773
Okay. Back to the park.

407
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,546
Let's finish this puppy.

408
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,944
Alice?

409
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,852
Eliot?

410
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,155
Alice!

411
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,317
Chill, man. They can
handle themselves.

412
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,425
Shh...

413
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,190
The hell was that?

414
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,190
This house is haunted
as balls, is what that is.

415
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,895
<i>Come in here, please.</i>

416
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,382
Okay.

417
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,449
Hello?

418
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,179
Anyone or anything?

419
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,109
Okay, Jesus, we get it.
There are ghosts in here.

420
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,410
I tagged you. You're it.

421
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,021
What just happened?

422
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,959
I tag you. You're it.

423
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,159
Do we go with this?

424
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,935
What other option do we have?

425
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,923
Okay, this is a little
kinky, even for me.

426
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,556
Would you care for refreshment?

427
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,456
Oh.

428
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,129
Um, okay, sure. Sounds divine.

429
00:23:58,837 --> 00:23:59,861
Okay.

430
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,967
Thank you.

431
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,946
We must get these things off our
hands. Do you know Popper 29 yet?

432
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,413
No magic in the house.

433
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,940
Be good, or she'll take
you to the quiet place.

434
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,688
We'll be good. Right, Eliot?

435
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,451
I mean, yeah.
You're the boss, kid.

436
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,992
She's coming.

437
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,468
Stop doing that.

438
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,313
My brother is too soft.

439
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,515
Caring for you when
he needs peace to work.

440
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:52,081
He has no idea how
naughty you truly are.

441
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,061
Now drink your tea.

442
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,068
Drink it!

443
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,082
No. I'm over here.

444
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,762
Holy shit. That's
Christopher Plover.

445
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,546
Is it just me, or does it feel like
we're being shown something,

446
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,765
like how it was?

447
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,704
Yeah, the time slip.

448
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,673
You say that like,
"Yeah, a sunrise."

449
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,076
Sunderland talks about it all the
time. She has a PhD in hauntings.

450
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,523
Her favorite thing
about a haunted house is

451
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,039
you get these ghost movies
of the past running on a loop.

452
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,347
You see shit like it was.

453
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,682
I didn't know any of that.

454
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,118
Of course not. You're an idiot.

455
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,881
Oh, my God, it's her.

456
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,617
It's a tiny chick in a beret.

457
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,124
Slow down, Jane.

458
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,888
That's Jane and
Martin from the books.

459
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,898
Nerdgasm. This makes sense.

460
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,877
Uh, Plover took them in,
and they spent their days

461
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,111
playing with the
housekeeper's kids.

462
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,015
Martin, he was, like,
really sick that summer...

463
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,562
Martin, hurry!

464
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,420
Janey, wait for me.

465
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,177
Wait, no. I'm coming with you.

466
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,639
Why won't you take me?

467
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,317
Ember, Umber, why won't
you let me in anymore?

468
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,891
I try to be good.

469
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,386
Martin. Are you all right?

470
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,992
Where's Jane?

471
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,259
Fillory.

472
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,070
What's wrong with me?

473
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:49,532
Nothing. Some things just aren't
fair. We can't make sense of them.

474
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,607
Let's have tea, hmm? Come on.

475
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,078
Us left-behinds
ought to stick together.

476
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,845
She's coming. We need to hide.

477
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,513
Quentin?

478
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,990
Okay, I'm getting
the fuck out of...

479
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:13,632
What did I tell you children
about disturbing Mr. Plover?

480
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,147
Great.

481
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,316
No talking in the quiet place.

482
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,935
Lady, I don't know
who you think I am, but...

483
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,861
Insolent is what you are.

484
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:48,665
I've told you I'll sew it shut.

485
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,395
Alice.

486
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,652
Hey, hey, we need to hustle.

487
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,551
Mrs. Danvers could come back.

488
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,020
Oh, my God.

489
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,623
Do you know what this is?

490
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,392
A vaguely whimsical horror show?

491
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,460
She did this.

492
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,873
She really did this to the
children, Plover's sister.

493
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,041
She tied them up
and drugged them

494
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,442
so that they wouldn't
disturb his work.

495
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,368
Okay, well, maybe ghost girl
can tell us where the button is.

496
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,597
Hey, Beatrix?

497
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,163
Beatrix. Hey.

498
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,109
My tummy feels bad.

499
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,577
Beatrix, it's okay.

500
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,771
How can we help her?

501
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:37,974
I don't think we can.

502
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,222
Well, I guess we
know how she died.

503
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,055
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

504
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:52,196
It's okay. It's over. It's
been over for a long time.

505
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,393
No, no, no. Not for her. She
just keeps reliving it over and over.

506
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,663
We have to... We have
to go. We have to go.

507
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,000
- It's not the same.
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

508
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,573
Here, have another.

509
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,810
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

510
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,216
Oh!

511
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:16,352
Shall we work a little? I
think that might be nice.

512
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,314
Do you think that might be nice?

513
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,959
Martin, Mr. Plover, I'm
back. I was in Fillory.

514
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,674
Martin, I brought you
what you asked for.

515
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,031
You must have a look.
We'll be right back, sir.

516
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,195
She's tracking mud
all over the floor.

517
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,341
Stop that. You're pinching me.

518
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,433
You've got it?

519
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,910
Yes. Let's go show Mr. Plover.

520
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,107
No, please. Let's not. For me.

521
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,081
The button's a key.

522
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:53,357
I know you're here. I
know you're spying on us.

523
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,287
George, come out.

524
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,424
Take this. It's a game, George.

525
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,198
How well can you
hide the button?

526
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,144
All right.

527
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,239
Well, I won't
forget any of it, so...

528
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,974
I know you won't.

529
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,020
Can I give you a
little advice in return?

530
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,112
Yeah. Forget that school.

531
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,124
The world never did help
a smart girl. Why would it?

532
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,854
We scare the shit
out of the world.

533
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,656
If the world goes after
you, take it as a compliment.

534
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,005
You know, I could come
back. We could do more.

535
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,475
This was really the
big one. No, I know.

536
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,138
I just... You know, I'm
sure you have more things...

537
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,475
I do need one other thing.

538
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,311
Yeah, sure. Anything.

539
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,545
Kill me.

540
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,287
That's crazy.

541
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,256
I'm allowed to be done.

542
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:00,654
No. I can't.

543
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,090
Well, I need you to.

544
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,896
You knew. You
knew, and you did...

545
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,368
No, I did not sign up for this.

546
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,768
Then what? Pleasantries?

547
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,704
No, how about
not killing anyone?

548
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,813
What do you think
redemption looks like, Julia?

549
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,174
Being nice? Donating
shoes to Africa?

550
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,509
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

551
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,213
What if she's wrong?

552
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,911
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

553
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,220
What if there really is a
hell and this takes me there?

554
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,621
You're already
in hell. So is she.

555
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,596
What am I supposed to do?

556
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,232
Whichever's hardest.

557
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,909
Oh, thank you.

558
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:58,307
Drink up, Jane, and eat.
You must be famished.

559
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,261
Jane, don't you want to join us?

560
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,929
Oh, she's tired.
That's all right.

561
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,405
You go ahead,
Martin. Like last time.

562
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,236
I don't know if I want to.

563
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,779
Remember when I took you
and your sister to town for cinema?

564
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,087
Bought her that
dress she wanted.

565
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,682
Yes. We're grateful.

566
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:41,591
When I was a boy, I didn't have
anyone who thought about me.

567
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,194
I swore it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

568
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,295
I care about you, Martin.

569
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,136
Come on, in front of the camera.

570
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,369
Give me a smile.

571
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:06,278
Oh, I have the best news. I
am so close to figuring it all out.

572
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:11,449
Wild magic. Too strong
to do with human hands.

573
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,688
I'll have to grow another
finger. Can you imagine?

574
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,094
Of course, there's spellwork
for that, too, if I can master it.

575
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,835
All right, you can go
ahead and take that off now.

576
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,056
Trousers, too,
darling. All of it.

577
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:54,356
I think the solution to all of
our problems lies in Fillory.

578
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,493
I need to go there with you.

579
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,066
But... I know. It's
been for you kids,

580
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,402
but I think we could
find a way to go.

581
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,707
We could be together.

582
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,043
You're a lovely boy, Martin.

583
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,977
Now turn around.

584
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,954
They play like
that all the time.

585
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,385
A whole pile of naughty
pictures hidden in the dictionary.

586
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,588
Oh, no. The mean lady.

587
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,228
Little spy! I didn't
see anything!

588
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,769
I swear. May God punish you.

589
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,736
My brother is a good man. No.

590
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,296
You all hound
him. It's your fault.

591
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,602
Stop. Leave him alone.

592
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,082
To the quiet place.

593
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,685
For the best.

594
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,553
We should go back in there.
- Shh...

595
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,810
I'm trying to think, and I'm
out of cigarettes. This is dire.

596
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,379
Oh, my God. You're okay.

597
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,853
We're great. We're
both great, actually.

598
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,978
Where's Penny?

599
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,220
Knowing him, Disneyland by now.

600
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,520
What if he got to Fillory?
What did he do to Martin?

601
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,690
What are you talking about?

602
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,538
I saw something in there,

603
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,630
who Plover really was,

604
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,005
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

605
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,345
Well, what was he doing?

606
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,484
Oh, God.

607
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,017
The poor kid, he was just
trying to get a button to Fillory,

608
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,290
you know, so he could escape
this monster, who, by the way,

609
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,557
generations of idiots like me have
been worshiping like a literary god,

610
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,325
who was learning magic...

611
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,396
To get stronger, to travel,

612
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,602
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

613
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,412
Grow fingers? Like...

614
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,958
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

615
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,680
What if he went there
because he had access

616
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,446
via these kids who
he liked to tell stories to

617
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,115
when he wasn't
drugging and raping them?

618
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,055
Jesus.

619
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,554
Well, I still have the
capacity to be surprised.

620
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,390
Thought you ditched us.

621
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,159
What happened to you?

622
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,829
Man, I traveled into a
fucking tree about a mile off,

623
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,772
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

624
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,172
Not so precise with the travel?

625
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,574
Shut up. Wait, what do
you mean, "dungeon"?

626
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,412
I mean some dirt-floor basement
bitch calls "the quiet place,"

627
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,475
'cause that's not
fucking psychotic.

628
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,145
There's a storm
cellar around the back.

629
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,731
That's where she took
the housekeeper's kid.

630
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,166
He's got the button
in his pocket. Let's go.

631
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,421
Whoa! That's a
great idea if you want

632
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,772
Prudence to grab us immediately.

633
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,486
Dislike.

634
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,706
Okay. I know what
to do about her.

635
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,826
Uh, give me a 10-minute head
start, and then head to the cellar.

636
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,637
What are you doing
out of the playroom?

637
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,710
This is going well.

638
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,122
Where the hell's
Quentin? He's coming.

639
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,342
You're all going
to the quiet place...

640
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,439
Hey, Prudence!

641
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,814
I heard the nastiest
rumor about your brother.

642
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,749
Okay, fine, but there are
about 48 more of those

643
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,555
that I just hid all
over the house.

644
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,206
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows
exactly what Christopher Plover did.

645
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,254
No.

646
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,626
Okay.

647
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,814
Well, that bought
us about 10 minutes.

648
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,238
Let's go dig up a dead body.

649
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,610
It's done.

650
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,045
Richard and I, we...

651
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,119
So this is what that's like.

652
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,047
Do you want me to stay?

653
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,615
So you're found meditating in my
room next to my overdosed corpse?

654
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,586
Yeah, well, when
you put it like that...

655
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,200
Bye, Julia.

656
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,799
Have a good life.

657
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,813
We'd better go.

658
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,094
Quentin.

659
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,266
We have to go back. Come on.

660
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,571
We have to go back, Quentin.

661
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,939
And do what, exactly?

662
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,940
Help those children.

663
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,805
You can't seriously be
thinking of leaving them there.

664
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,684
They were there
before we were born.

665
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,017
Trapped.

666
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,089
This is exactly the kind of thing
that we should be able to fix.

667
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,285
There are ways to
clear a haunted house.

668
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,353
The house, yes. It doesn't
help with the ghosts.

669
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:00,728
There are rituals in
every civilization...

670
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,130
To prevent this, not reverse it.

671
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,935
We have to help them.
There has to be something.

672
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,569
Those kids, they did
nothing. It is so unfair.

673
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,309
You don't say.

674
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,610
You're not helping.
I'm the only one helping.

675
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,677
Life ain't fair.

676
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,811
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

677
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,515
Thinking that you
can change anything,

678
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,956
it's such an act of
monumental ego.

679
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,859
I mean, who the fuck do
you think you really are?

680
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,705
I mean, you're just
some arrogant, little twat.

681
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,823
So suck it up. Shut the fuck up.

682
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:40,764
Vix...

683
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,939
If we're gonna go, we got to go.

684
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,897
Thanks, but I'm okay.

685
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,608
No, you're not.

686
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,977
Okay, I'm not.

687
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,777
Are you okay?

688
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:26,776
No.

689
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,352
Well...

690
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,114
I've been freaked about The
Beast since that day, you know?

691
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,353
And I've been
worried about myself.

692
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,790
And now that we know
who he is, what he is,

693
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,736
what he did to those
kids, Martin, I just...

694
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,681
I want to kill him, you know?

695
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,937
I want to step through the nearest
clock, and I want to wring his neck.

696
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,537
Okay.

697
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,479
Let's see this button.

698
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,621
It looks so ordinary.

699
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:10,084
No, I feel something
coming off of it, hard.

700
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,931
You guys really don't feel that?

701

00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,344

00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,575
