1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,412
QUENTIN: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:03,546
QUENTIN: <i>It is
The Beast, isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,981
<i>And he's from
Fillory, which is real.</i>

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,337
Want to know what
The Beast wants?

5
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,846
He wants control of Fillory
and all the doors that lead there.

6
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,310
ELIZA: <i>I gave you
a book about it.</i>

7
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,174
Stuff they're saying I
did, I don't remember.

8
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,113
Were you blacked
out when we met?

9
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:19,176
We need something or someone to
lean on that is bigger than ourselves.

10
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,983
JULIA: <i>What was that?</i>
RICHARD: <i>Did it work?</i>

11
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,750
More energy than I've ever felt.

12
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,260
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,627
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,932
She is the only one who
can actually give me answers.

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,336
There are no answers,

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,536
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,978
JULIA: <i>Dear Q,</i>

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,019
<i>I don't need to tell you how
fucking pissed at you I am.</i>

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,678
<i>Probably got the
message around the time</i>

20
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>I incepted the shit out of you.</i>

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,885
<i>I don't understand why we fell
apart after being friends forever.</i>

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,660
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part.
I never meant to really hurt you.</i>

23
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,332
<i>I put it down. I got help.</i>

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,779
<i>I know you're not
supposed to say</i>

25
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,669
<i>the other person fucked up, too,</i>

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,003
<i>but you fucked up, too.</i>

27
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:19,169
<i>And it broke us, and I hate you
for that, because I really miss us, Q.</i>

28
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,209
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

29
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,409
<i>Jules.</i>

30
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,884
QUENTIN: <i>J, got your letter.</i>

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,586
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

32
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,125
<i>But I'm glad you're
okay. I really am.</i>

33
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,417
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

34
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,031
RICHARD: <i>It's not
black and white, Julia.</i>

35
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,004
It's all I thought about all
day when I was in there,

36
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,941
and it's all that I think
about now that I'm out.

37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,674
Well, there's this sometimes
very handy thing called "penance."

38
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,340
What, like 50 magic
lashes? (CHUCKLES)

39
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,086
That spell you used

40
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,232
to get inside your friend's
mind, do you remember it?

41
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,782
That's a perfect
example of something

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,019
that can be used to
help instead of hurt.

43
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,653
If you're not afraid
to do the work...

44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,992
I'm not.

45
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,724
Okay.

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,894
Q?

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,607
You can't sleep?

48
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,104
I just, uh...

49
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,347
Eliza gave me the answer,
apparently, and I lost it.

50
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,047
<i>Fillory and Further,</i> book six.

51
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,420
It was important,
and it just vanished.

52
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,386
So did you look for it?

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,655
Yeah, of course.
Everywhere. I...

54
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,059
(SIGHS)

55
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:46,997
Fillory is always deciding
when to let the Chatwins go

56
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,671
and deciding when
to kick them out,

57
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,205
because Ember and Umber...

58
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,831
Right, twin gods of Fillory.

59
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,747
They get mean and take
everything away, I know.

60
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,378
Essentially, yeah.
They have their reasons.

61
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,746
But that's what happened
in the manuscript.

62
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,713
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

63
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,512
It's a manuscript, not a
referendum on your character.

64
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,783
No. I...

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,590
In the books... So you lost it.

66
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,217
What do you do when
you lose something?

67
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,143
So you had it the whole time.

68
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,364
I don't know what you're
yapping about, as usual.

69
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,822
Book six.

70
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,290
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

71
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,020
Like I said, it wasn't me.

72
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,427
(SCOFFS)

73
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,658
Want to get that
thing out of my face?

74
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,091
Fine. I took the stupid thing.

75
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,465
I was bored. It was there.

76
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,568
Now it's gone.

77
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,041
"Gone?" What do
you mean, it's gone?

78
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,610
I mean I read it,

79
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,307
I spilled my beer on it,
I tossed it in the trash,

80
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,939
and then I went
and got another beer.

81
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,883
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

82
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,478
Wait. You said you read
it. Do you remember it?

83
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,522
Ish.

84
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,388
This is important.
Okay, I need you...

85
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,120
I need to punch
you in the throat

86
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,956
if you tell me
what I need to do.

87
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,573
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

88
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,031
You've got the
scars to prove it.

89
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,933
I don't understand why we can't
just be basic allies. (CHUCKLES)

90
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,379
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

91
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,338
more than you want to live.

92
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,807
What did Plover say
in the book? Come on.

93
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,341
First of all, what's-his-name
didn't write it.

94
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,482
Plover. Christopher Plover.

95
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:48,044
(CLEARS THROAT)
The girl did. Jane Chatwin.

96
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,850
Wrote book six? Holy shit.

97
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,188
<i>Yeah, she started off by saying</i>

98
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,303
<i>that the other books were wrong,</i>

99
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,660
<i>and she wanted to go
back and clarify some shit.</i>

100
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,822
Wrong in what way?

101
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,868
Um, this was the
summer that the mom died,

102
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:05,599
and they were hanging out in
Plover's mansion, eating crumpets.

103
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,136
Right, um...

104
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,269
<i>Jane and Martin opened a
closet, and they went to Fillory.</i>

105
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,012
No. Martin didn't go.

106
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,341
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

107
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,817
"Forgetting him"?

108
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,429
Yeah. Martin was
crying like a little bitch

109
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,183
about Fillory not
wanting him anymore,

110
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,453
and Jane said, "Hang tight,"
and she'll find some way

111
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,926
that Martin can go back to
Fillory anytime he wanted.

112
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,939
<i>I dunno, there were, like,
creatures or something.</i>

113
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,240
Questing Creature.
If you catch one,

114
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,508
they're forced to
grant you a wish.

115
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,777
There's seven of them.
There's a, uh, uh, dog, a rabbit...

116
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,962
Stop!

117
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,129
I'm literally becoming less
cool with every word you speak.

118
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,732
So, I assume she, uh,
had her enchanted bow,

119
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,674
uh, so that she
could actually get one.

120
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,302
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

121
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,409
Yes, right. Yes.

122
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,107
Stop, or I'll shoot.

123
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,053
DOG: Hello, human child.

124
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,246
PENNY: It <i>was a dog.</i>

125
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,186
I need a key to unlock
the door to Fillory.

126
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,254
I caught you, dog.

127
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,795
No, wait. Not a dog.

128
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,052
It was a pig.

129
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,489
By decree of Ember and Umber,
you must give me what I ask.

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,865
Wrong. No. What was it? Back up.

131
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,198
For fuck's sake.

132
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,131
Hello, human child.

133
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,606
I caught you.
Give me what I ask.

134
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,934
Did it work?

135
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,735
As you wish, so shall it be.

136
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,317
ALICE: <i>Wait.</i>

137
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,087
So, the button is the key?

138
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,986
Well, this all makes sense.

139
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,318
It does?

140
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,656
In the last book, Martin, he's
obsessed with finding the lost button.

141
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,837
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

142
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,196
The message boards are
insane, um, with different theories,

143
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,310
because the books... They
just say that the button's magic.

144
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,361
They don't... Nothing
specific about it.

145
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,996
This is huge.

146
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,664
Why is this huge?

147
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,770
Because it could still be
there at Plover's house.

148
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,207
Martin never found it.

149
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,469
We could...

150
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,778
You are talking about a direct
ticket to The fucking Beast.

151
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,614
Better than him
having one to us.

152
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,515
Look, this is in a manuscript

153
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,217
that you're probably the
only person to have ever read.

154
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,320
There's a chance
the button's still there.

155
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,392
I'm going, and like it or not,
Penny, you should come.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,193
I'm coming, too.

157
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,093
Okay.

158
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,197
So, what's the quickest
way to England?

159
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,031
Penny, do you...

160
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,467
Dick.

161
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,820
Uh, great. I'll pack.

162
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,303
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

163
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,454
ELIOT: To where?

164
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,728
Uh...

165
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,660
Scurry along, Ronald.

166
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,858
Raymond.

167
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,126
Raymond.

168
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,794
Have a great day.

169
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,773
Um...

170
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,942
So, you seem good.

171
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,003
Could use a top-up.

172
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,080
So, where are you
flying off to, exactly?

173
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,545
Uh, England.

174
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:07,953
Oh?

You don't need a plane.

176
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,352
Margo and I made a door
directly to our favorite pub.

are you today, Kira?

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,813

Yeah.

Kira, I want you to think of
somewhere that you love.

Did Richard tell you who I am?

220
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,433
Just that you're
extremely smart.

00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,609
Can you tell it doesn't work?

223
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,012
There was an answer. I
could feel it. I couldn't get there.

224
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,347

Now, Christopher Plover, already
a prolific and respected author,

237
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,324
was looking for
inspiration for his new book

238
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,327
when Jane, Martin and Rupert
Chatwin moved in next door.

239
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,303
Not exactly. Excuse me?

240

Question from the back.

241
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,639
No, uh, uh not a question,
more of a correction.

242
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,608
The kids got there
first, Jane and Martin,

243
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
and then Rupert got injured.

Oh, so we have ourselves
an expert. (LAUGHS)

And Plover's previous work,

246
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,648
well, he only got
rejections for it.

247
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,901
It just didn't really
show the depth

248

so understood children

258
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,712
because of his own
tragic childhood.

259
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,720
He aided many
families in the area.

260
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,157
He paid for the education of
his housekeeper's children,

261
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,024
George and Beatrix.

262
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,191
Not only did he
write for the Chatwins,

263
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,931
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

264

walked through a closet

265

to get to Fillory.

This is where Fillory was born,

268
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,190
where Plover told
tales to Jane and Martin.

Rumors about Plover.

307
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,663
There are these kids that were
missing, kids that knew Plover.

308
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,936
And in his absence,
people were talking,

309
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,171
and the longer that
they stayed vanished,

310
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,841
the more people started
connecting them in a bad way.

No, I bet it's more
complicated than that, right?

Well, because...

313
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,354
Because Fillory
is actually real.

314
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,950
Exactly, and Plover was crushed

315
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,459
that the Chatwins were missing,

316
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,325
because he knew
exactly where they went.

318

And the books were
already getting famous,

319
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:43,569
so maybe it was easier
just to say he died, I guess.

320
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,070

He was involved

go to school, either.

Come on.

388
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,938
Well, I went to MIT, but I didn't
study a lick of magic in school.

00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,908
This is brilliant.

390

Magic is science.

you have the natural bent.

Yeah.

I wonder if I do.

What if it's all just
one big party trick

397

This one day in this

this dumb little spell over and over,

Sounds lovely.

It was.

405

No one bothered us under here.

It was like we were invisible.
We'd read <i>Fillory</i> books for hours.

528
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,771
How can we help her?

529
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:37,974
I don't think we can.

530
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,042
(COUGHING)

531
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,222
Well, I guess we
know how she died.

532
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,055
ALICE: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

533
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:52,196
It's okay. It's over. It's
been over for a long time.

534
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,393
No, no, no. Not for her. She
just keeps reliving it over and over.

535
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,663
We have to... We have
to go. We have to go.

536
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,000
MARTIN: It's not the same.
PLOVER: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

537
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,573
Here, have another.

538
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,810
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

539
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,216
Oh!

540
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:16,352
Shall we work a little? I
think that might be nice.

541
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,314
Do you think that might be nice?

542
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,959
Martin, Mr. Plover, I'm
back. I was in Fillory.

543
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,674
JANE: Martin, I brought
you what you asked for.

544
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,031
You must have a look.
We'll be right back, sir.

545
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,195
She's tracking mud
all over the floor.

546
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,341
JANE: Stop that.
You're pinching me.

547
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,433
You've got it?

548
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,910
Yes. Let's go show Mr. Plover.

549
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,107
No, please. Let's not. For me.

550
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,081
JANE: The button's a key.

551
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:53,357
I know you're here. I
know you're spying on us.

552
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,287
George, come out.

553
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,424
Take this. It's a game, George.

554
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,198
How well can you
hide the button?

555
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,144
All right.

556
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,239
Well, I won't
forget any of it, so...

557
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,974
I know you won't.

558
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,020
Can I give you a
little advice in return?

559
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,112
Yeah. Forget that school.

560
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,124
The world never did help
a smart girl. Why would it?

561
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,854
We scare the shit
out of the world.

562
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,656
If the world goes after
you, take it as a compliment.

563
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,005
You know, I could come
back. We could do more.

564
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,475
This was really the
big one. No, I know.

565
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,138
I just... You know, I'm
sure you have more things...

566
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,475
I do need one other thing.

567
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,311
Yeah, sure. Anything.

568
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,545
Kill me.

569
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,287
That's crazy.

570
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,256
I'm allowed to be done.

571
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:00,654
No. I can't.

572
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,090
Well, I need you to.

573
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:03,928
(GASPS)

574
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,896
You knew. You
knew, and you did...

575
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,368
No, I did not sign up for this.

576
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,768
Then what? Pleasantries?

577
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,704
No, how about
not killing anyone?

578
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,813
What do you think
redemption looks like, Julia?

579
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,174
Being nice? Donating
shoes to Africa?

580
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,509
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

581
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,213
What if she's wrong?

582
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,911
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

583
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,220
What if there really is a
hell and this takes me there?

584
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,621
You're already
in hell. So is she.

585
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,596
What am I supposed to do?

586
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,232
Whichever's hardest.

587
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,669

589
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,909
Oh, thank you.

590
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:58,307
Drink up, Jane, and eat.
You must be famished.

591
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,261
Jane, don't you want to join us?

592
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,929
Oh, she's tired.
That's all right.

593
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,405
You go ahead,
Martin. Like last time.

594
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,236
I don't know if I want to.

595
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,779
Remember when I took you
and your sister to town for cinema?

596
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,087
Bought her that
dress she wanted.

597
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,682
Yes. We're grateful.

598
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:41,591
When I was a boy, I didn't have
anyone who thought about me.

599
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,194
I swore it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

600
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,295
I care about you, Martin.

601
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,136
Come on, in front of the camera.

602
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,369
Give me a smile.

603

(CAMERA CLICKS)

604
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:06,278
Oh, I have the best news. I
am so close to figuring it all out.

605
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:11,449
Wild magic. Too strong
to do with human hands.

606
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,688
I'll have to grow another finger.
(LAUGHS) Can you imagine?

607
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,094
Of course, there's spellwork
for that, too, if I can master it.

608
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,835
All right, you can go
ahead and take that off now.

609
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,056
Trousers, too,
darling. All of it.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

611
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:54,356
I think the solution to all of
our problems lies in Fillory.

612
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,493
I need to go there with you.

613
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,066
But... I know. It's
been for you kids,

614
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,402
but I think we could
find a way to go.

615

(CAMERA CLICKS)

616
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,707
We could be together.

You're a lovely boy, Martin.

618
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,977
Now turn around.

619
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,954
They play like
that all the time.

620
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,385
A whole pile of naughty
pictures hidden in the dictionary.

621
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,588
Oh, no. The mean lady.

622
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,228
Little spy! I didn't
see anything!

623
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,769
I swear. May God punish you.

624
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,736
My brother is a good man. No.

625
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,296
You all hound
him. It's your fault.

626
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,602
Stop. Leave him alone.

back in there. ELIOT: Shh...

632
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,810
I'm trying to think, and I'm
out of cigarettes. This is dire.

633

Oh, my God. You're okay.

634
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,853
We're great. We're
both great, actually.

635
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,978
Where's Penny?

636
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,220
Knowing him, Disneyland by now.

637
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,520
What if he got to Fillory?
What did he do to Martin?

638
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,690
What are you talking about?

639
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,538
I saw something in there,

640
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,630
who Plover really was,

641
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,005
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

642
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,345
Well, what was he doing?

643
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,484
Oh, God.

644
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,017
QUENTIN: The poor kid, he was
just trying to get a button to Fillory,

645
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,290
you know, so he could escape
this monster, who, by the way,

646
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,557
generations of idiots like me have
been worshiping like a literary god,

647
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,325
who was learning magic...

648
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,396
To get stronger, to travel,

649
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,602
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

650
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,412
Grow fingers? Like...

651
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,958
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

652
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,680
What if he went there
because he had access

653
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,446
via these kids who
he liked to tell stories to

654
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,115
when he wasn't
drugging and raping them?

655
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,055
Jesus.

656
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,554
Well, I still have the
capacity to be surprised.

657
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,390
Thought you ditched us.

658
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,159
What happened to you?

659
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,829
Man, I traveled into a
fucking tree about a mile off,

660
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,772
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

661
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,172
Not so precise with the travel?

662
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,574
Shut up. Wait, what do
you mean, "dungeon"?

663
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,412
I mean some dirt-floor basement
bitch calls "the quiet place,"

664
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,475
'cause that's not
fucking psychotic.

665
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,145
There's a storm
cellar around the back.

took the housekeeper's kid.

667
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,166
He's got the button
in his pocket. Let's go.

668
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,421
Whoa! That's a
great idea if you want

669
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,772
Prudence to grab us immediately.

670
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,486
Dislike.

671
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,706
Okay. I know what
to do about her.

672
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,826
Uh, give me a 10-minute head
start, and then head to the cellar.

out of the playroom?

678
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,814
I heard the nastiest
rumor about your brother.

679
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,749
Okay, fine, but there are
about 48 more of those

680
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,555
that I just hid all
over the house.

681
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,206
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows
exactly what Christopher Plover did.

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,254
No.

683
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,626
Okay.

684
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,814
Well, that bought
us about 10 minutes.

685

So this is what that's like.

00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,047
Do you want me to stay?

690
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,615
So you're found meditating in my
room next to my overdosed corpse?

691
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,586
Yeah, well, when
you put it like that...

00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,094
Quentin.

700
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,266
ALICE: We have to
go back. Come on.

701
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,571
We have to go back, Quentin.

702
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,939
And do what, exactly?

703
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,940
Help those children.

704
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,805
You can't seriously be
thinking of leaving them there.

705
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,684
They were there
before we were born.

706
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,017
ALICE: Trapped.

707
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,089
This is exactly the kind of thing
that we should be able to fix.

708
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,285
There are ways to
clear a haunted house.

709
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,353
The house, yes. It doesn't
help with the ghosts.

710
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:00,728
There are rituals in
every civilization...

711
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,130
To prevent this, not reverse it.

712
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,935
We have to help them.
There has to be something.

713
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,569
Those kids, they did
nothing. It is so unfair.

714
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,309
You don't say.

715
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,610
You're not helping.
I'm the only one helping.

716
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:17,972
(CHUCKLES)

717
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,677
Life ain't fair.

718
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,811
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

719
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,515
Thinking that you
can change anything,

720
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,956
it's such an act of
monumental ego.

721
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,859
I mean, who the fuck do
you think you really are?

722
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,705
I mean, you're just
some arrogant, little twat.

723
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,823
So suck it up. Shut the fuck up.

724
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:40,764
Vix...

725
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,939
If we're gonna go, we got to go.

726
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,897
Thanks, but I'm okay.

727
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,608
No, you're not.

728
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,977
Okay, I'm not.

729
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,777
Are you okay?

730
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:26,776
No.

731
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,352
Well...

732
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,114
I've been freaked about The
Beast since that day, you know?

733
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,353
And I've been
worried about myself.

734
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,790
And now that we know
who he is, what he is,

735
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,736
what he did to those
kids, Martin, I just...

736
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,681
I want to kill him, you know?

737
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,937
I want to step through the nearest
clock, and I want to wring his neck.

738
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,537
PENNY: Okay.

739
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,479
Let's see this button.

740
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,621
It looks so ordinary.

741
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:10,084
No, I feel something
coming off of it, hard.

742
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,931
You guys really don't feel that?

743
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,038
I think you should put it away.

744
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,606
Hey, don't talk
to me like I'm you.

745
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,841
Mayakovsky trained me himself.

746
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,344
I stay put until I want to go.

747
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,575
Period.

748
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,051
Told him not to do that.
