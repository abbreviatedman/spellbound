1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,274
QUENTIN: Previously
on The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,430
<i>QUENTIN: It is The Beast,
isn't it?</i>

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,840
<i>And he's from Fillory,
which is real.</i>

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,240
Want to know what
The Beast wants?

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,715
He wants control of Fillory
and all the doors
that lead there.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,279
ELIZA: <i>I gave you</i>
a <i>book about it.</i>

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,080
Stuff they're saying I did,
I don't remember.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,998
Were you blacked
out when we met?

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,119
We need something
or someone to lean on
that is bigger than ourselves.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,918
J U LIA: <i>What was that?
RICHARD: Did it work?</i>

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,678
More energy than
I've ever felt.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,196
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,510
<i>Eliza is dead.</i>

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,876
She is the only one
who can actually
give me answers.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,234
There are no answers,

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,439
because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,872
J U LIA: Dear Q,

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,918
<i>I don't need to tell you
how fucking
pissed at you I am.</i>

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,593
<i>Probably got
the message around the time</i>

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,637
<i>l incepted
the shit out of you.</i>

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,793
<i>I don't understand
why we fell apart
after being friends forever.</i>

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,590
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry for my part.
I never meant to
really hurt you.</i>

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,276
<i>I put it down. I got help.</i>

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,629
<i>I know you're
not supposed to say</i>

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,552
<i>the other person
fucked up, too,</i>

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,950
<i>but you fucked up, too.</i>

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,111
<i>And it broke us,
and I hate you for that,
because I really miss us, Q.</i>

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,116
<i>I'm working on forgiving you.</i>

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,315
<i>Jules.</i>

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>QUENTIN: J, got your letter.</i>

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,512
<i>I guess we're both still mad.</i>

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,033
<i>But I'm glad you're okay.
I really am.</i>

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,353
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,952
<i>RICHARD: It's not black
and white, Julia.</i>

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,914
It's all I thought about
all day when I was in there,

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,839
and it's all that I
think about now that I'm out.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,591
Well, there's this sometimes
very handy thing
called "penance."

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,273
What, like 50 magic lashes?
(CHUCKLES)

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,999
That spell you used

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,878
to get inside
your friend's mind,
do you remember it?

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,713
That's a perfect
example of something

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,958
that can be used to
help instead of hurt.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,599
If you're not
afraid to do the work...

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,909
I'm not.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,670
Okay-

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,835
Q?

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,553
You can't sleep?

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,034
I just, uh...

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Eliza gave me the answer,
apparently, and I lost it.

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,994
<i>FiIIory and Further, book six.</i>

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,357
It was important,
and it just vanished.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,320
So did you look for it?

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,550
Yeah, of course.
Everywhere. I...

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,990
(SIGHS)

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,910
Fillory is always deciding
when to let the Chatwins go

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,598
and deciding when
to kick them out,

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,114
because Ember and Umber...

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,759
Right, twin gods of Fillory.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,672
They get mean
and take everything away,
I know.

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,314
Essentially, yeah.
They have their reasons.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,670
But that's what happened
in the manuscript.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,633
For some reason,
I didn't deserve it.

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,434
It's a manuscript,
not a referendum
on your character.

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,715
No. I...

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,519
In the books...
So you lost it.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,159
What do you do when
you lose something?

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,079
So you had it the whole time.

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,232
I don't know
what you're yapping about,
as usual.

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,719
Book six.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,235
The day we met, you said
you had nothing to do with it.

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,958
Like I said, it wasn't me.

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,350
(SCOFFS)

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Want to get that
thing out of my face?

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,031
Fine. I took the stupid thing.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,400
I was bored. It was there.

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,469
Now it's gone.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,994
"Gone?"
What do you mean, it's gone?

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,519
I mean I read it,

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,234
I spilled my beer on it,
I tossed it in the trash,

80
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,879
and then I went
and got another beer.

81
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,795
Unbelievable.
That's unbelievable.

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,440
Wait. You said you read it.
Do you remember it?

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,436
lsh.

84
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,318
This is important.
Okay, I need you...

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,038
I need to punch
you in the throat

86
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,878
if you tell me
what I need to do.

87
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,394
The Beast is trying
to pick us both off.

88
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,954
You've got
the scars to prove it.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,834
I don't understand why
we can't just be basic allies.
(CHUCKLES)

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,274
You can't possibly
want to be a dick

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,271
more than you want to live.
I...

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,716
What did Plover say
in the book? Come on.

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,272
First of all, what's-his-name
didn't write it.

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,393
Plover. Christopher Plover.

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,996
(CLEARS THROAT)
The girl did. Jane Chatwin.

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,792
Wrote book six? Holy shit.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,109
<i>Yeah,
she started off by saying</i>

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,156
<i>that the other
books were wrong,</i>

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,595
<i>and she wanted to go back
and clarify some shit.</i>

100
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,755
Wrong in what way?

101
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,798
Um, this was the summer
that the mom died,

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,556
and they were hanging out
in Plover's mansion,
eating crumpets.

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,035
Right, um...

104
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,232
<i>Jane and Martin
opened a closet,
and they went to Fillory.</i>

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,952
No. Martin didn't go.

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,279
<i>Fillory kept forgetting him.</i>

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,714
"Forgetting him"?

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,313
Yeah. Martin was
crying like a little bitch

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,118
about Fillory not
wanting him anymore,

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,352
and Jane said, "Hang tight,"
and she'll find some way

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,875
that Martin can go back
to Fillory anytime he wanted.

112
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,838
<i>l dunno, there were, like,
creatures or something.</i>

113
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,115
Questing Creature.
If you catch one,

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,349
they're forced to
grant you a wish.

115
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,670
There's seven of them.
There's a, uh, uh,
dog, a rabbit...

116
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,909
Stop!

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,029
I'm literally
becoming less cool
with every word you speak.

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
So, I assume she, uh,
had her enchanted bow,

119
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,592
uh, so that she could
actually get one.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,279
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,352
Yes, right. Yes.

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,029
Stop, or I'll shoot.

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,954
DOG: Hello, human child.

124
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,195
PENNY: It was a dog-

125
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,118
I need a key to
unlock the door to Fillory.

126
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,189

caughtyou,dog.

127
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,715
No, wait. Not a dog.

128
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,995
It was a pig.

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,429
By decree of Ember and Umber,
you must give me what I ask.

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,796
Wrong.
No. What was it? Back up.

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,109
For fuck's sake.

132
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,033
Hello, human child.

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,555
lcaughtyou.
Give me what I ask.

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,870
Did it work?

135
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,674
As you wish, so shall it be.

136
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,275
ALICE: <i>Wait.</i>

137
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,994
So, the button is the key?

138
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,874
Well, this all makes sense.

139
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,234
ltdoes?

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,551
In the last book, Martin,
he's obsessed with
finding the lost button.

141
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,710
He's tearing
Plover's house apart.

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,112
The message boards are insane,
urn, with different theories,

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,191
because the books...
They just say that
the button's magic.

144
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,272
They don't...
Nothing specific about it.

145
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,953
This is huge.

146
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,593
Why is this huge?

147
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,720
Because it could still
be there at Plover's house.

148
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,154
Martin never found it.

149
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,395
We could...

150
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,711
You are talking
about a direct ticket
to The fucking Beast.

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,552
Better than him
having one to us.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,434
Look, this is in
a manuscript

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,150
that you're probably the only
person to have ever read.

154
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,233
There's a chance
the button's still there.

155
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,351
I'm going,
and like it or not,
Penny, you should come.

156
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,158
I'm coming, too.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,035
Okay-

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,157
So, what's
the quickest way to England?

159
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,993
Penny, do you...

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,395
Dick.

161
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,758
Uh, great. I'll pack.

162
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
I'm sure we can
find a direct flight.

163
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,355
ELIOT: To where?

164
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,670
Uh...

165
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,592
Scurry along, Ronald.

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,035
Raymond.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,715
Have a great day.

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,710
Um...

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,832
So, you seem good.

170
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,911
Could use a top-up.

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,039
So, where are you
flying off to, exactly?

172
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,470
Uh, England.

173
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,910

There was an answer.
I could feel it.
I couldn't get there.

No, uh, uh not a question,

The kids got there first,
Jane and Martin,

242
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,154
and then Rupert got injured.

so understood children

George and Beatrix.

261

Not only did he
write for the Chatwins,

262
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,875
but he took them in briefly
when their mother died.

tales to Jane and Martin.

people were talking,

they stayed vanished,

309

the more people
started connecting them

were missing,

And the books were
already getting famous,

just to say he died, I guess.

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,000
My tummy feels bad.
(GASPING)

525
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,479
Beatrix, it's okay.

526
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,630
(COUGHING)

527
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,675
How can we help her?

528
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,870
I don't think we can.

529
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,951
(COUGHING)

530
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,115
Well,
I guess we know how she died.

531
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,952
ALICE: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

532
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,074
It's okay. It's over.
It's been over
for a long time.

533
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,278
No, no, no. Not for her.
She just keeps
reliving it over and over.

534
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,556
We have to...
We have to go. We have to go.

535
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,912
MARTIN: It's not the same.
PLOVER: Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,472
Here, have another.

537
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,718
Let's spoil our dinner, hmm?

538
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,110
Oh!

539
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,234
Shall we work a little?
I think that might be nice.

540
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,191
Do you think
that might be nice?

541
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,831
Martin, Mr. Plover,
I'm back. I was in Fillory.

542
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,513
JANE: Martin, I brought
you what you asked for.

543
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,910
You must have a look.
We'll be right back, sir.

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,116
She's tracking mud
all over the floor.

545
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,239
JANE: Stop that.
You're pinching me.

546
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,310
You've got it?

547
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,754
Yes. Let's go show Mr. Plover.

548
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,032
No, please.
Let's not. For me.

549
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,994
JANE: The button's a key.

550
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,240
I know you're here.
I know you're spying on us.

551
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,198
George, come out.

552
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,309
Take this.
It's a game, George.

553
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,073
How well can you
hide the button?

554
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,079
All right.

555
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,153
Well, I won't
forget any of it, so...

556
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,918
I know you won't.

557
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,917
Can I give you
a little advice in return?

558
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,040
Yeah.
Forget that school.

559
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,999
The world never did
help a smart girl.
Why would it?

560
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,753
We scare the shit
out of the world.

561
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,592
If the world goes after you,
take it as a compliment.

562
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,879
You know, I could come back.
We could do more.

563
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,349
This was really the big one.
No, I know.

564
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,000
I just... You know,
I'm sure you
have more things...

565
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,354
I do need one other thing.

566
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,238
Yeah, sure. Anything.

567
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,435
Kill me.

568
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,190
That's crazy.

569
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,157
I'm allowed to be done.

570
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,554
No. I can't.

571
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,000
Well, I need you to.

572
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,835
(GASPS)

573
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,797
You knew.
You knew, and you did...

574
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,234
No,
I did not sign up for this.

575
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,674
Then what?
Pleasantries?

576
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,637
No,
how about not killing anyone?

577
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,712
What do you think
redemption looks like, Julia?

578
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,030
Being nice?
Donating shoes to Africa?

579
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,430
You think that really burns
the tumors off your soul?

580
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,074
What if she's wrong?

581
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,800
You know, what if a Magician
finds a cure tomorrow?

582
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,070
What if there really is a hell
and this takes me there?

583
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,510
You're already in hell.
So is she.

584
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,479
What am I supposed to do?

585
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,159
Whichever's hardest.

586
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,550
(INHALES DEEPLY)

587
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,990
(OWL HOOTING)

588
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,839
Oh, thank you.

589
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,191
Drink up, Jane, and eat.
You must be famished.

590
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,190
Jane,
don't you want to join us?

591
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,829
Oh, she's tired.
That's all right.

592
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,319
You go ahead, Martin.
Like last time.

593
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,154
I don't know if I want to.

594
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,715
Remember when I took
you and your sister
to town for cinema?

595
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,999
Bought her that dress
she wanted.

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,595
Yes. We're grateful.

597
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,514
When I was a boy,
I didn't have anyone
who thought about me.

598
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,073
I swore it wouldn't happen
to any child I cared about.

599
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,192
I care about you, Martin.

600
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,034
Come on,
in front of the camera.

601
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,271
Give me a smile.

602
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,550
(CAMERA CLICKS)

603
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,196
Oh, I have the best news.
I am so close
to figuring it all out.

604
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,351
Wild magic.
Too strong to do
with human hands.

605
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,554
I'll have to grow
another finger. (LAUGHS)
Can you imagine?

606
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,991
Of course, there's spellwork
for that, too,
if I can master it.

607
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,749
All right, you can go ahead
and take that off now.

608
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,951
Trousers, too, darling.
All of it.

609
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,750
(CAMERA CLICKS)

610
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,274
I think the solution
to all of our problems
lies in Fillory.

611
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,393
I need to go there with you.

612
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,956
But...
I know. It's been
for you kids,

613
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,270
but I think we
could find a way to go.

614
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,230
(CAMERA CLICKS)

615
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,632
We could be together.

616
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,958
You're a lovely boy, Martin.

617
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,878
Now turn around.

618
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,830
They play like that
all the time.

619
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,312
A whole pile
of naughty pictures hidden
in the dictionary.

620
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,475
Oh, no. The mean lady.

621
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,113
Little spy!
I didn't see anything!

622
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,634
I swear.
May God punish you.

623
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,597
My brother is a good man.
No.

624
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,194
You all hound him.
It's your fault.

625
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,475
Stop. Leave him alone.

626
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,590
(EXHALES)

627
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,997
To the quiet place.

628
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,594
For the best.

629
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,198
(LIGHTS BUZZING)

630
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,399
ALICE: We should go
back in there.
ELIOT: Shh...

631
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,678
I'm trying to think,
and I'm out of cigarettes.
This is dire.

632
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,274
Oh, my God. You're okay.

633
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,749
We're great.
We're both great, actually.

634
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,870
Where's Penny?

635
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,112
Knowing him,
Disneyland by now.

636
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,439
What if he got to Fillory?
What did he do to Martin?

637
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,590
What are you talking about?

638
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,439
I saw something in there,

639
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,555
who Plover really was,

640
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,874
what he was doing
to Martin Chatwin.

641
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,233
Well, what was he doing?

642
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,394
Oh, God.

643
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,913
QUENTIN: The poor kid,
he was just trying
to get a button to Fillory,

644
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,153
you know, so he could
escape this monster,
who, by the way,

645
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,438
generations of idiots like me
have been worshiping
like a literary god,

646
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,234
who was learning magic...

647
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,273
To get stronger, to travel,

648
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,510
who was wanting to grow
extra fingers for spells.

649
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,317
Grow fingers? Like...

650
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,754
What if The Beast
wasn't from Fillory?

651
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,595
What if he went there
because he had access

652
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,354
via these kids who he
liked to tell stories to

653
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,035
when he wasn't
drugging and raping them?

654
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,954
Jesus.

655
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,439
Well, I still have
the capacity to be surprised.

656
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,270
Thought you ditched us.

657
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,075
What happened to you?

658
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,716
Man, I traveled into
a fucking tree
about a mile off,

659
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,679
getting away from that
crazy Prudence's dungeon.

660
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,072
Not so precise
with the travel?

661
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,477
Shut up.
Wait, what do you mean,
"dungeon"?

662
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,313
I mean some
dirt-floor basement
bitch calls "the quiet place,"

663
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,391
'cause that's not
fucking psychotic.

664
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,039
There's a storm
cellar around the back.

665
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,554
QUENTIN: That's where she took
the housekeeper's kid.

666
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,994
He's got the button in
his pocket. Let's go.

667
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,310
Whoa! That's a great
idea if you want

668
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,629
Prudence to grab
us immediately.

669
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,390
Dislike.

670
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,555
Okay.
I know what to do about her.

671
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,713
Uh, give me
a 10-minute head start,
and then head to the cellar.

672
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,520
What are you doing
out of the playroom?

673
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,556
This is going well.

674
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,954
Where the hell's Quentin?
He's coming.

675
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,236
You're all going to
the quiet place...

676
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,310
QUENTIN: Hey, Prudence!

677
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,712
I heard the nastiest rumor
about your brother.

678
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,634
Okay,
fine, but there are about
48 more of those

679
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,438
that I just hid
all over the house.

680
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,034
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows exactly what
Christopher Plover did.

681
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,190
No.

682
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,515
Okay-

683
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,389
Well, that bought
us about 10 minutes.

684
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,157
Let's go dig up a dead body.

685
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,520
JULIA: It's done.

686
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,958
Richard and I, we...

687
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,031
So this is what that's like.

688
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,950
Do you want me to stay?

689
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,556
So you're found
meditating in my room
next to my overdosed corpse?

690
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,274
Yeah, well,
when you put it like that...

691
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,430
(CHUCKLES)

692
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,075
Bye,JuHa.

693
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,719
Have a good life.

695
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,790
(SOBBING)

696
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,719
We'd better go.

697
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,354
(JULIA SOBBING)

698
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,990
Quentin.

699
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,157
ALICE: We have to go back.
Come on.

700
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,469
We have to go back, Quentin.

701
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,835
And do what, exactly?

702
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,833
Help those children.

703
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,714
You can't seriously
be thinking of leaving them
there.

704
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,480
They were there
before we were born.

705
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,914
ALICE: Trapped.

706
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,956
This is exactly
the kind of thing
that we should be able to fix.

707
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,190
There are ways to
clear a haunted house.

708
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,272
The house, yes.
It doesn't help
with the ghosts.

709
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,636
There are rituals in
every civilization...

710
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,036
To prevent this,
not reverse it.

711
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,831
We have to help them.
There has to be something.

712
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,470
Those kids, they did nothing.
It is so unfair.

713
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,194
You don't say.

714
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,476
You're not helping.
I'm the only one helping.

715
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,875
(CHUCKLES)

716
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,598
Life ain't fair.

717
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,718
Why in the high, holy fuck
should death be any different?

718
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,438
Thinking that you
can change anything,

719
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,830
it's such an act
of monumental ego.

720
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,753
I mean, who the fuck
do you think you really are?

721
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,513
I mean, you're just
some arrogant, little twat.

722
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,711
So suck it up.
Shut the fuck up.

723
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,675
Vix...

724
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,838
If we're gonna go,
we got to go.

725
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,799
Thanks, but I'm okay.

726
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,519
No, you're not.

727
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,874
Okay, I'm not.

728
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,674
Are you okay?

729
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,670
No.

730
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,230
Well...

731
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,998
I've been freaked
about The Beast
since that day, you know?

732
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,230
And I've been worried
about myself.

733
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,715
And now that we know
who he is, what he is,

734
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,638
what he did to those kids,
Martin, I just...

735
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,515
I want to kill him, you know?

736
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,831
I want to step
through the nearest clock,
and I want to wring his neck.

737
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,435
PENNY: Okay.

738
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,391
Let's see this button.

739
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,511
It looks so ordinary.

740
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,999
No, I feel something
coming off of it, hard.

741
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,838
You guys really
don't feel that?

742
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,959
I think
you should put it away.

743
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,479
Hey, don't talk
to me like I'm you.

744
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,717
Mayakovsky trained me himself.

745
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,235
I stay put until I want to go.

746
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,469
Peﬂod.

747
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,954
Told him not to do that.
