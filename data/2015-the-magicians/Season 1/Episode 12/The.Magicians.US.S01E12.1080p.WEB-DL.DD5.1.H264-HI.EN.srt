00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,297
I did.

365
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,398
The answer is yes, you can stay,

366
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,930
with a few caveats.

367
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,225
Here it comes.

368
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,296
One, no harm comes to the books.

369
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,806
Yeah, we get that.

370
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,738
Two, no food, drinks,
or any other intoxicants

371
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,013
are allowed in the library
at any time.

372
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,028
That includes emotion bottles.

373
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,427
Damage always ensues.

374
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,829
[glass shattering]

375
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,799
[all inhale and groan]

376
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,830
You understand, of course.

377
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,166
[all groaning and moaning]

378
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,311
I planned my whole outfit
around that bottle!

379
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,749
[indistinct chatter]

380
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,621
Could you get
to the point, Quentin?

381
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,278
I have a trustees meeting.

382
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,486
You know something about
what's been happening here...

383
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,057
The Beast, Eliza.

384
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,858
I would like to know
what is really going on here.

385
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,296
I know you would,
but we are done.

386
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,630
- How did you lose your virginity?
- I was 24 years old.

387
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,235
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

388
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,167
She was considerably
older than I

389
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,641
and, oh, much, much
more experienced.

390
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,310
But...

391
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,579
Fuck!

392
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,080
You've managed to dose me,
haven't you?

393
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,352
In my tea.
You little shit.

394
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,356
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

395
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,017
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

396
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,385
you would have done so already,
but you haven't.

397
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,230
Eliza...
who is she?

398
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,398
Eliza's real name
is Jane Chatwin.

399
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,069
Oh...

400
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,307
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one. Uh...

401
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,080
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

402
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:17,048
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book

403
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,549
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

404
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,688
Uh, yeah, Ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

405
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:28,225
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time on a cosmic scale,

406
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,957
and Jane used it
to create a time loop.

407
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,025
When she'd fail to stop The Beast,
she'd restart the loop.

408
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:40,871
A time loop.
Okay. Uh...

409
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,142
So what do we have to do
with The Beast?

410
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,712
You just keep getting involved.

411
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,581
I don't keep doing anything.

412
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,110
Can you imagine, Quentin,

413
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,952
how many times we've had
this exact conversation?

414
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,553
You've managed to slip
truth serum to me 27 times,

415
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,386
27 ways, and I'm quite sick of it.

416
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,232
So, what, this is just some giant,
blood-soaked "Groundhog Day"?

417
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,729
You always bring up
that fucking movie.

418
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,461
I still haven't seen it.

419
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,566
[chuckles]

420
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,327
Now it's a point of pride.

421
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,736
Answer my question.

422
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:16,739
In each loop,
Jane alters something

423
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,642
to see if it'll
change the outcome.

424
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,475
The sigil that appeared
on your hand,

425
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,147
brought you to Alice...

426
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,248
that was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

427
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,921
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

428
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,490
and we all know how well
that particular great idea

429
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:32,957
worked out, don't we?

430
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,758
So has anything actually helped?

431
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,860
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

432
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,463
How many times have I died?

433
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,925
39.

434
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,933
39 times.

435
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,795
And if you die a 40th,

436
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,203
at least I won't
have to hear you

437
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,865
ask me this question ever again.

438
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,776
Jane's dead, Quentin.

439
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,277
The loop's done.

440
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,509
There's no one to reset it.

441
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,345
So this is it?

442
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,018
This isn't my problem.

443
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,019
My problem is that
I'm strong enough

444
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,121
to discern a time loop

445
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,893
but not strong enough
to change it.

446
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:07,558
We better hope and pray

447
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,459
that Jane altered the right
thing this time around.

448
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,662
Anything else, Quentin?

449
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,595
What's different this time?

450
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,138
Please, no books on the floor.

451
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,047
I love this one.

452
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,917
Photos from places
I can't imagine.

453
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,748
I know you hate it now,

454
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,756
but travelers wrote
our most precious books.

455
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,687
The library is what it is
because of them.

456
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,662
You make it sound
so simple and fun.

457
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,166
No. But it is valuable.

458
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,727
And in my observation,

459
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,535
master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

460
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,376
I was looking
for any technical info

461
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,237
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but...

462
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,906
The books you seek
are in another branch.

463
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,876
Of course they are.

464
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,045
Look, could you...
could you expedite that shit?

465
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,785
I don't have much time,

466
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,890
and I really need to know
how to take people with me.

467
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,393
I'll put in a request.

468
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,456
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

469
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,465
Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote "The Trial"

470
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,936
after spending a week
in the library.

471
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:29,367
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

472
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,635
you will get a handle on it.

473
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,580
I promise.

474
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,648
If?

475
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,419
Say that in my book?

476
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,491
No spoilers.

Hi.

481
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,123
- I was at Brakebills?
- You were supposed to be.

482
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,460
Or you were, like, 39 times.

483
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,261
You were the thing they changed.

484
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,433
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

485
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:28,472
and you would get stronger,
and...

486

I should have

You're taking this a lot

It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

I can barely believe it.

Wha... what?

514
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,991
Some friends and I got into

- Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Who did this magic?

00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,926
I told you.
She did.

I mean, it was crazy.

was defragging.

I mean, she...
she touched all of us.

She granted every petition.

She cured Menolly's

539

she sent Richard

542
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,950
Not regular magic.

543
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,387
Look, I can't lie, okay?

544
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,618
It was shitty going
for a while there,

545
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,015
not being in Brakebills,

546
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,486
but I can't sit here now

547
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,525
and think it was
anything but fate.

548
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,167
Right, or just the right
random combination.

549
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,598
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

550
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,776
I need your help.

551
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,511
I don't know how to get back,

552
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,812
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

553
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,015
and I just... I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

554
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,178
and I have to find a way, um...

555
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,516
Let me get this straight.

556
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,991
You want me to come
to Fillory with you.

557
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,032
Uh, yeah.

558
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,556
Come here.

559
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,396
Holy shit.
This is our table.

560
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,873
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

561
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,692
We kind of have, huh?

562
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:31,342
Our Lady gave me a mission to...

563
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,543
I sound like a nutjob.

564
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,575
- Kind of.
- [chuckles]

565
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,680
What's the mission?

566
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,719
She said it was my destiny

567
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,120
to basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

568
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,293
You know, she said
it was something

569
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:51,796
that couldn't be given.
It had to be found.

570
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:55,966
So we have to find it.

571
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,767
And I bet you it's here.

572
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,799
So I guess we're off
to see the Wizard.

573
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,466
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

574
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:08,212
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,
and then their mom dies, 1941.

575
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,882
Q, where are you
going with this?

576
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:12,781
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

577
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,453
but we do know when they open...

578
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,787
every time the Chatwins go.

579
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,418
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

580
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,591
then we could follow 'em in.

581
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,126
Uh...

582
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:26,097
Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

583
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,258
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

584
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,066
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

585
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,969
Wait, but that would put us
in past Fillory, right?

586
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,140
Fillory is magic.

587
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,809
Remember,
Jane falls in that swamp,

588
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,580
and then she comes out
20 years later.

589
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:44,678
She strikes a deal with
the Watcherwoman to send her back.

590
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:49,153
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

591
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,821
I have an idea,

592
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,552
something Richard told me,

593
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:55,092
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

594
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,861
Brakebills.

595
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,192
Okay.

596
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,926
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

597
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,299
in order to get
through the wards.

598
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,468
Alumni key.

599
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,039
Richard gave it to me.

600
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,268
This place is impossible.
How does anyone find anything?

601
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,876
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

602
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,547
What have you got?
Anything?

603
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,478
"The Book of Mike McCormick."

604
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,483
Novella, really.

605
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,623
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

606
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,458
But the worst part?

607
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,527
His life was happy.

608
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,958
Eliot, he's gone.

609
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,732
Why are you torturing yourself?

610
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:36,167
Because he's gone
and it's my fault.

611
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,868
And of all the people
in the world

612
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,839
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

613
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,344
- What are you doing?
- Putting the past behind me.

614
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,643
[gasps]
No, stop!

615
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,976
Look, he's had
a really bad week.

616
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,580
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

617
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,582
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

618
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,645
It's one book.

619
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,721
No, it's a life.

620
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,522
They're irreplaceable.

621
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,659
No, wait!

622
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,330
What did you do?

623
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,371
Let's go.

624
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,004
<i>"Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

625
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,936
"Bridge to the Cretaceous period."

626
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,544
Oh, hey, here's one.

627
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,045
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

628
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,548
[laughs]
Voyage of the "Titanic."

629
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,250
Oh, fun.

630
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,892
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

631
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:31,017
to one specific
point in time and...

632
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,860
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

633
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:36,028
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

634
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,287
All got used up by the '70s.

635
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,796
Wait a minute.

636
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,866
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

637
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,567
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

638
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,739
"Operation Die Fuehrer."
[scoffs]

639
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,870
Guess no one told 'em Hitler was

640
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,405
a pretty serious
battle Magician?

641
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,909
Yeah.

642
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,979
Uh, yep, and Hitler killed them.

643
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,480
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

644
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,217
Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

645
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,918
April 19th.

646
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,751
Yeah.

647
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,656
You remember the, uh...
yeah, "The Flying Forest."

648
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,111
Yeah, uh,
Jane's going into town.

649
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,833
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

650
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:17,601
April 21, 1942.

651
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,702
Two days after this time bridge.

652
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,474
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

653
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,743
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

654
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:27,811
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

655
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,352
Yeah.

656
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,849
Earth fountain's blocked off.

657
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,320
- I told you it would be.
- It was worth a shot.

658
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,222
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

659
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,623
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

660
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,164
of the library
in the first place?

661
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,327
All right, let's keep moving.

662
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,928
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

663
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,700
We're highly trained
Earth magicians.

664
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,169
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from Brakebills?

665
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,137
Dude, Josh Hoberman,
class of '16.

666
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,308
Come with me
if you want to live.

667
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,307
I've always wanted to say that.

668
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,639
[chuckles]

669
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,852
But seriously, um, we should go.

670
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:05,947
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

671
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,498
Welcome to <i>Chez Hoberman</i>.

672
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:12,456
[electricity buzzing]

673
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,387
You're welcome to whatever.

674
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,992
Just don't eat the carrots.

675
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,163
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

676
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,333
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

677
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,735
Holy shit.
This tastes like pizza.

678
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,237
Yeah, I know, right?

679
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,668
How long have you
been down here?

680
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,173
A few weeks.

681
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,565
Just been camped out,

682
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,036
waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

683
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,178
Anyone else?

684
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,679
From my class.

685
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
Look, don't freak,
but back at Brakebills,

686
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,052
nobody knows what happened
to you guys.

687
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:41,680
And it's sort of been two years.

688
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,146
Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

689
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,655
Victoria warned me about that.

690
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,426
Victoria?
You know her?

691
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,387
She's the only reason I'm alive.

692
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,126
Look are you gonna tell us

693
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,931
what the fuck happened
to your class, or what?

694
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,033
Where'd you guys go?

695
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,068
To Fillory for spring break.

696
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,771
V's amazing.

697
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,873
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

698
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,376
<i>Teachers put this tattoo
on her to stop her.</i>

699
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,246
She just cut it off herself.

700
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,607
- Joshy.
- What?

701
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,905
- You're not gonna believe it.
- What?

702
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,276
I did it.
I found Fillory.

703
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,845
- What?
- I found Fillory!

704
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,422
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo! We're going to Fillory!

705
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,962
- We're going to Fillory?
- [laughs] Uh-huh!

706
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,687
<i>So we decided to plan a trip.</i>

707
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,532
<i>You know, party,
smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

708
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,427
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

709
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,929
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first year class,</i>

710
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,731
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

711
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,202
<i>Luckily, V was so good,</i>

712
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:32,141
<i>she was able
to take them all with.</i>

713
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,267
<i>It was magical.</i>

714
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:38,142
<i>[chuckles] I mean,
more magical than Brakebills,</i>

715
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:41,412
<i>like going from black and white
