1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,312
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,360
What does that mean?

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:04,948
<i>Jesus, we could
not have screwed up</i>

4
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,416
<i>that spell worse, and
we can't take it back.</i>

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,851
You showed up with
that sigil on your hand.

6
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,915
<i>It appeared when I
was dreaming of Fillory.</i>

7
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,644
<i>It came from Jane.</i>

8
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,675
Who are you? I'm a
member of The Order,

9
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,592
the keepers of the
libraries of the Neitherlands.

10
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,793
Any idea who the motherfuckers

11
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,261
in the hoods are that
are trying to kill me?

12
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,330
They've been thoroughly cursed,
so they can't use the fountains,

13
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,674
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment.

14
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:23,823
The Beast?

15
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,951
We are the best
Magicians we know.

16
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,923
But Menolly is dying.

17
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,706
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

18
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,754
And you?

19
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,663
Eight years ago, I
was a drug addict,

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,296
and I left my son in a hot car.

21
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,681
We're not learning anything new.

22
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,968
The Beast always kills us.

23
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,008
There was one time we didn't
all die. When we went to Fillory.

24
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,787
<i>Point is, we need some
serious battle magic.</i>

25
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,473
Bottling our emotions.

26
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,747
<i>And when the feelings come
back, it's extremely intense.</i>

27
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,953
<i>Near the bridge,</i>

28
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,623
there's a man who has
served me 1,000 years.

29
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,093
Bring him three gifts.

30
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,496
He'll show you the way.

31
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,898
Huh. Not what I expected.

32
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,030
Yeah.

33
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,936
Die, fucker!

34
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,177
Well, that sucked ass.

35
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,881
Julia, Kady!

36
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,114
Finally.

37
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,122
Are we interrupting?

38
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,352
Ah, no, no, no. Just
passing the time.

39
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,062
So... Uh, yeah, um...

40
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,989
We bring forsythia. Mmm-hmm.

41
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,666
And honeycomb.

42
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,772
Hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm.

43
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,037
Two down.

44
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,269
Where's the platinum?

45
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,245
We didn't bring that. Too bad.

46
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,396
Exit through the gift shop.

47
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,045
But we did bring something

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,713
of great and shining worth.

49
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,887
Just say it.

50
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,558
If you're wrong, you're wrong.

51
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,825
We brought you our faith.

52
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,763
Ooh.

53
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,273
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

54
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,665
I like it.

55
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,705
But to be honest, I'm sensing

56
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,338
more skepticism than faith here.

57
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,211
Look, I'm trying.

58
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,249
She's the one that
had the dream, okay?

59
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,526
Kady, your mother
used your faith,

60
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,086
but she isn't your true mother.

61
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,234
Our Lady feels you
require a miracle.

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,709
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,009
What...

64
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,308
What did he do?

65
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,153
I don't know. I've
had this tightness

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,850
ever since my
mom, but it's gone.

67
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,758
There it is.

68
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,321
Faith.

69
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,503
Okay, so...

70
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,300
Let's get to brass.

71
00:03:58,872 --> 00:03:59,965
You're here, why?

72
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,607
We seek an audience
with Our Lady Underground.

73
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,810
Yeah, no shit.

74
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,274
Why do you think you
deserve to see her?

75
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,911
It's okay.

76
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,321
Why should she waste
her time with you?

77
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,451
I am privileged, and I
have done some stupid shit,

78
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,392
and I have been through nothing

79
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,896
compared to some of my friends.

80
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,432
So you wish to help them?

81
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,365
Heal them? Is that it?

82
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,869
Yes, that is exactly
what I want to do.

83
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,030
No.

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,441
No, no, no.

85
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,005
Magicians...

86
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,072
That's all you ever
want, power, every time.

87
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,844
You know what?

88
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,278
For the longest time,
that is all I wanted.

89
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,958
But now, I just want to do

90
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,789
whatever the fuck
it is I'm supposed to.

91
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,993
And if she's around,
if she gives a shit,

92
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,093
I have to believe she
wants her daughters

93
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,965
to show a little ambition.

94
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,999
So, you tell her

95
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:10,442
that I am trying to
reach something higher.

96
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,942
<i>Nuestra Se√±ora</i> sits and waits,

97
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,208
and no one asks.

98
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,652
She watches.

99
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,520
She weeps.

100
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,160
But today, she's
grinning like a fool.

101
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,927
Here's the invocation.

102
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,459
May her blessings be with you.

103
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,726
Thank you.

104
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,861
And one more piece
of advice for the chosen.

105
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,098
You can't unring a bell,

106
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,636
so, be certain
when you call, Julia.

107
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,091
Okay.

108
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,137
Look.

109
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,439
All of y'all look like you
did a crime last night.

110
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,088
According to all
the probability shit,

111
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,488
we don't have time to wait.

112
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:36,322
One or another super shitty
ending is coming within days,

113
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,058
if we don't at least
try to go get the knife.

114
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,659
So...

115
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,128
Oh, God.

116
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,164
The Neitherlands is Grand
Central for the multiverse.

117
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,903
<i>The button will bring you in,</i>

118
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,343
and once you're there...
Yes, the fountains are portals.

119
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,005
Can I say this?

120
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,440
For your interest?

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,209
As far as I know,

122
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,420
you don't need a button or
anything to ride the fountains,

123
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,178
so don't fall in.

124
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,481
Don't get lost.

125
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,456
The whole place is crawling with

126
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,687
<i>battle magic motherfuckers
with hoods on.</i>

127
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,585
<i>We get separated,</i>

128
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,063
you're dead.

129
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,526
Seriously,

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,692
what the fuck is going
on with you people?

131
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,738
Nothing. We're
fine, aren't we, El?

132
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,280
We're phenomenal.

133
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,712
Fine, okay. We're not okay.

134
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,945
Forget it. We just need to...

135
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,010
We're going to...

136
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,214
It's over!

137
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,548
I need a minute.

138
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,256
Alice is just a little
bit sensitive right now.

139
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,839
Would you just shut
the fuck up, Margo?

140
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,627
Are you seriously
mad at me right now?

141
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,059
What the fuck
did I just walk into?

142
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,624
My life. Welcome.

143
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,295
It's not funny,
and it's not a joke.

144
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,963
But it truly is, Quentin.

145
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,836
You people need
to stow your shit!

146
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,217
We get it! Would
you just, please,

147
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,234
give us a goddamn minute?

148
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,125
<i>I just want to dance
all over the room</i>

149
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,320
<i>All I wanted to do
All I wanted to do</i>

150
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,262
<i>Just celebrate</i>

151
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,563
<i>Party with my
friends or all by myself</i>

152
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,761
How you doing?

153
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,367
Come on.

154
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,699
Stop worrying.

155
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,702
So, the hermit was creepy.

156
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,972
Super creepy.

157
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,014
You didn't feel what I felt.

158
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,747
I don't know. Whatever
he was channeling,

159
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,344
it was the real deal.

160
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,381
She's just nervous.

161
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,816
There's always some creepy guy

162
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,566
when you're about to
blow the patriarchy's

163
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,990
head out of their ass.

164
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,123
Everything is, um...

165
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,755
About to change.

166
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,456
Everything.

167
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,728
Finally.

168
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,337
Yeah. Cheers.

169
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,672
What?

170
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,977
Okay, you are the least crazy.

171
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,648
Tell me what's going on.

172
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,547
It... Nothing. Just forget it.

173
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,829
What the hell are you drinking?

174
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,351
I don't know.

175
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,485
Triple sec?

176
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,327
What did Quentin do?

177
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,596
I don't want to talk about it.

178
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,791
Fair enough.

179
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,893
Can I get some?

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,104
It's good.

181
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,647
It's not good.

182
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,978
No, it's not good.

183
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,050
Yeah.

184
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,011
Let you in on a
little secret, though.

185
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,754
I used to drink
Midori in high school.

186
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,290
It's like melon,

187
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,090
crossed with perfume,

188
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,357
crossed with ass.

189
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,898
Yum.

190
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,558
Fuck did I know?

191
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,196
I was trying to get
the voices to go away.

192
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:09,009
Point is, I'm not judging
anyone for triple sec.

193
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,072
And...

194
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,901
I can tell when someone's
trying to make something go away.

195
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,522
So, Midori, huh?

196
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,319
Does it work?

197
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,925
Nothing works forever.

198
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,824
But, you know,

199
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,963
if you stop worrying
about forever,

200
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,410
there's plenty of shit that can
get you through the next hour.

201
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,747
Is what he said
still bugging you?

202
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,584
He looked at me like
he could see through me.

203
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,520
And Kady doesn't seem
to share your reservation.

204
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,996
She seems better.

205
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah.

206
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,460
I don't know why
I feel this way.

207
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,203
Our Lady came to me in a dream.

208
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,764
Shouldn't that remove all doubt?

209
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,375
Look, something like
this is about intention,

210
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,835
what we bring into it.

211
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,947
Our intentions are pure.

212
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,478
So just stop worrying?

213
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,616
Yeah.

214
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,804
Just like...

215
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,511
For now.

216
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,350
Tomorrow you can
worry all you want

217
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,823
about Our Lady Underground.

218
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,291
Tonight...

219
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,257
Tonight should
be about Dionysus.

220
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,024
Whoo, ooh.

221
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,566
Dionysus, okay.

222
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,495
You, uh...

223
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,696
You bang a lot of
undergrads with that one?

224
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:45,962
Fewer than I'd hoped.

225
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,391
So...

226
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,095
Hmm? Say it works.

227
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,168
And that means what for you?

228
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,270
You asking if I'm coming back?

229
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,175
Kind of, yeah.

230
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,435
I hadn't much
planned for it, really.

231
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,471
I just want to get there,

232
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,714
and I'll stay, or go
somewhere quiet.

233
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,218
If Our Lady has
other plans, hmm.

234
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,647
I'll do that.

235
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,616
I'll miss you.

236
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,321
I'll miss you, too.

237
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,192
To think you were so crabby in
rehab, we almost never spoke.

238
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:51,796
Hey.

239
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,537
God, you are really
something, Julia.

240
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,086
I bet you say
that to all the girls

241
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,840
you slept with
three minutes ago.

242
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,979
That's funny. Hmm.

243
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,676
But I mean it. I do.

244
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,741
That bite, that...

245
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,730
That thing in you that wants
to puzzle everything out,

246
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,949
that is gold.

247
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,019
No matter how
crabby it makes me?

248
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,690
I think especially when
it makes you crabby.

249
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,697
I think that us angry,

250
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,601
questioning people
sometimes shut up too fast,

251
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,665
and that is probably part
of why the gods took off.

252
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:32,908
No one around with the fire
to keep yelling their names.

253
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,917
This is gonna sound
corny, but don't lose that fire.

254
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,047
Well, it sounds like
you're saying goodbye.

255
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,289
I'm saying thank you.

256
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,594
So, this is a little
hitch in our adventure.

257
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,291
Are we just gonna
act like children now?

258
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,767
Now, now, Bambi. He's
got a right to be mad.

259
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,894
No, he doesn't.

260
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,113
People don't get to be mad at me

261
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,257
because I had sex with them.

262
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,805
You're welcome, both of you.

263
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,898
Oh, come on.

264
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,674
We were all messed
up on emotion magic.

265
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,069
We deserve a pass.

266
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,239
I don't need a pass.

267
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,612
You two have ruined my life.

268
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,036
No offense, Quentin, but I
think you did that all yourself.

269
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,395
Can we just cut to the part

270
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,682
where we go to another world,

271
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,723
and skip the whole guilt

272
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,951
and recriminations bit, please?

273
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,085
You would like
that, wouldn't you?

274
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,954
Is it wrong that I'm starting
to side with The Beast?

275
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,061
All right.

276
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,513
Didn't think you
had that in you.

277
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,784
You don't get to shame me.

278
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,827
You slept with two other
people. We broke up.

279
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,163
I was out of my mind.

280
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,269
I made a mistake, and
you aimed a weapon.

281
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,269
I'm glad it hurt.
It should hurt.

282
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,830
Boys and girls,

283
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,843
I hate to cut into what
is clearly a moment,

284
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,438
but the fact is,

285
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,776
according to the best
and only magic we have,

286
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,180
we have to go or
The Beast will kill us.

287
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,273
End of story.

288
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,179
Take out your emotions.

289
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,578
You can fight later.

290
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,380
Sound good?

291
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,903
All right, if you
guys are using those

292
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,156
emotion bottles,

293
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,352
let's go.

294
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,489
How I was feeling about Quentin

295
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,390
would have got us all killed.

296
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,362
I was very angry a moment ago,

297
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,395
but I have to be honest.

298
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,262
You two would
make a cute couple.

299
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,601
Join hands, everyone.

300
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,649
Let's move, fast.

301
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,517
The map says...

302
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,150
Got it.

303
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,456
Quentin?

304
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,430
We've been waiting.

305
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,302
Come on! Hurry!

306
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,632
Run!

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,173
Shit.

308
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,246
Okay.

309
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,655
We certainly lost that fight.

310
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,783
How'd you find this place?

311
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,883
I got lucky last time.

312
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,019
Quentin had the map.

313
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,563
Shit. MARGO: No map,

314
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,189
evil mercenary
assholes everywhere,

315
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,563
stuck in a library.

316
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,659
This is not how we
decided this would go.

317
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,928
Penny, you know this place.

318
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,066
There must be
somebody we can talk to.

319
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,203
Yeah, there might be.

320
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,570
Follow me.

321
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,819
Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet,

322
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:10,889
you are all late.

323
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,614
Actually, it's Margo.

324
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,725
This time.

325
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,400
Look, we need your help,

326
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,160
though, you probably
already knew that.

327
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,431
I did.

328
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,400
The answer is yes, you
can stay, with a few caveats.

329
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,492
Here it comes.

330
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,869
One, no harm comes to the books.

331
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,134
Yeah, we get that. Two,

332
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,301
no food, drinks, or
any other intoxicants

333
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,436
are allowed in the
library at any time.

334
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,626
That includes emotion bottles.

335
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,922
Damage always ensues.

336
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,502
You understand, of course.

337
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,939
I planned my whole
outfit around that bottle!

338
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,278
Could you get to
the point, Quentin?

339
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,711
I have a trustees meeting.

340
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,085
You know something about
what's been happening here.

341
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,088
The Beast, Eliza.

342
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,551
I would like to know what
is really going on here.

343
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,856
I know you would,

344
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,796
but we are done.

345
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,032
How did you lose your virginity?

346
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,792
I was 24 years old.

347
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,075
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

348
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,867
She was considerably
older than I,

349
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,136
and much, much more experienced.

350
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,468
But...

351
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,605
Fuck!

352
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,678
You've managed to
dose me, haven't you?

353
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,642
In my tea. You little shit.

354
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,920
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

355
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,734
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

356
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,057
you would have done so
already, but you haven't.

357
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:56,922
Eliza,

358
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,863
who is she?

359
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:02,829
Eliza's real name
is Jane Chatwin.

360
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,602
Oh.

361
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,617
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

362
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,641
Uh...

363
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,746
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

364
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,715
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book,

365
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,774
<i>The Girl Who Told Time?</i>

366
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,051
Uh, yeah, Ember gave
her a watch and a locket.

367
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,286
Ember gave her the
ability to fuck with time,

368
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,587
on a cosmic scale,

369
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,619
and Jane used it to
create a time loop.

370
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,459
When she'd fail
to stop The Beast,

371
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,727
she'd restart the loop.

372
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,093
A time loop.

373
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,459
Okay.

374
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,671
Uh...

375
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,671
So, what do we have
to do with The Beast?

376
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,211
You just keep getting involved.

377
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,109
I don't keep doing anything.

378
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,647
Can you imagine, Quentin,

379
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,945
how many times we've had this

380
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,609
exact conversation?

381
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,547
You've managed
to slip truth serum

382
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,556
to me 27 times,

383
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,956
27 ways, and
I'm quite sick of it.

384
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,857
So, what, this is just some giant,
blood-soaked <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

385
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,496
You always bring
up that fucking movie.

386
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,061
I still haven't seen it.

387
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,965
Now it's a point of pride.

388
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,264
Answer my question.

389
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,532
In each loop,

390
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,570
Jane alters something

391
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,234
to see if it'll change
the outcome.

392
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,312
The sigil that
appeared on your hand,

393
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,741
brought you to Alice.

394
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,115
That was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

395
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,278
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

396
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,297
and we all know how
well that particular

397
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,187
great idea worked out, don't we?

398
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,550
So, has anything
actually helped?

399
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,357
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

400
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,065
How many times
have I died? Thirty-nine.

401
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,901
Thirty-nine times.

402
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,436
And if you die a 40th,

403
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,935
at least I won't
have to hear you

404
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,633
ask me this question ever again.

405
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,440
Jane's dead, Quentin.

406
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,770
The loop's done.

407
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,577
There's no one to reset it.

408
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,641
So, this is it?

409
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,412
This isn't my problem.

410
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,848
My problem is that
I'm strong enough

411
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,617
to discern a time loop,

412
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,787
but not strong
enough to change it.

413
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,158
We better hope and pray

414
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,559
that Jane altered the
right thing this time around.

415
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,692
Anything else, Quentin?

416
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,031
What's different this time?

417
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,803
Please, no books on the floor.

418
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:27,970
I love this one.

419
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,407
Photos from places
I can't imagine.

420
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,347
I know you hate it now,

421
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,116
but Travelers wrote
our most precious books.

422
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,256
The library is what
it is because of them.

423
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,891
You make it sound
so simple and fun.

424
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,157
No.

425
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,760
But it is valuable.

426
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,666
And in my observation,

427
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,432
master Travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

428
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,269
I was looking for
any technical info

429
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,904
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but...

430
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,744
The books you seek
are in another branch.

431
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,345
Of course they are.

432
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,654
Look, could you... Could
you expedite that shit?

433
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,382
I don't have much
time, and I really

434
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,459
need to know how to
take people with me.

435
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,925
I'll put in a request.

436
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,920
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

437
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,129
Probably because Franz
Kafka wrote <i>The Trial</i>

438
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
after spending a
week in the library.

439
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,932
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

440
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,709
you will get a handle on it.

441
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,838
I promise.

442
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,707
If?

443
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,577
Say that in my book?

444
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,117
No spoilers.

445
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,148
Hi.

446
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,291
I was at Brakebills?
You were supposed to be.

447
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,826
Or you were, like, 39 times.

448
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,129
You were the thing they changed.

449
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,408
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

450
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,458
and you would
get stronger, and...

451
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,593
So, I was right.

452
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,795
The whole time, I was right.

453
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,267
I don't know what
to say, Jules. I...

454
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,920
I should have
believed you, Jules.

455
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,708
I should have known, and I'm...

456
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,514
Um...

457
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,379
Look, that doesn't make
up for what I did to you,

458
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,385
which was stupid,

459
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,126
and vindictive,

460
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,228
and really dangerous.

461
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,064
I'm so sorry, Q.

462
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,602
Thank you.

463
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,306
So, how do we
fix it? I don't know.

464
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,589
I just know that I'm
gonna get killed soon,

465
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,548
and I don't really want to die

466
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,083
being mad at my oldest friend.

467
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,281
I really fucking missed you.

468
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,280
Yeah, me, too, actually.

469
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,727
You smell the same.

470
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,398
Okay, all right.

471
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,736
Uh...

472
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,637
So...

473
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,144
Big conspiracy.

474
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,473
Wheels within wheels.

475
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,645
Julia doesn't go
to Brakebills, and?

476
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,145
You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

477
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,488
It's because there is bigger,

478
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,047
better magic in the world.

479
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,265
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

480
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,158
I can barely believe it.

481
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,464
What?

482
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,801
Some friends and I got
into some pretty eclectic shit.

483
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,396
You and Kady?

484
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,165
Where is she?

485
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,200
On a mission.

486
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,070
They all are.

487
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,706
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

488
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,074
From?

489
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,442
A goddess.

490
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,551
We summoned, and she came.

491
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,585
You mean, um, here?

492
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,621
To your loft?

493
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,628
You don't believe me.
Shit, I wouldn't, either.

494
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,792
That is why she gave me proof.

495
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,565
Is that milk? Yeah.

496
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,008
Cool,

497
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,441
useless, kind of gross.

498
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,141
But look under the hood.

499
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:02,980
Oh, my God.

500
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,690
Who did this magic?

501
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,694
I told you. She did.

502
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,853
I mean, it was crazy.

503
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,024
It was like being on a
massive dose of ecstasy.

504
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,761
When she touched me,

505
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,166
it was like my psyche
was defragging.

506
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,535
I mean, she... She
touched all of us.

507
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,336
She granted every petition.

508
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,167
She cured Menolly's
breast cancer,

509
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,214
she sent Richard to
where he wanted to go.

510
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,073
I watched this.

511
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,050
I thought magic
couldn't cure cancer.

512
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,779
Not regular magic.

513
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,148
Look, I can't lie, okay?

514
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,658
It was shitty going
for a while there,

515
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:40,951
not being in Brakebills,

516
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,757
but I can't sit here now,

517
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,627
and think it was
anything but fate.

518
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,000
Right, or just the right
random combination.

519
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,502
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

520
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,333
I need your help.

521
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,140
I don't know how to
get back, and, um...

522
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,958
My friends, we got separated,

523
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,060
and I just... I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

524
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,746
and I have to find a way...

525
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,346
Let me get this straight.

526
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,755
You want me to come
to Fillory with you?

527
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,855
Yeah.

528
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:19,923
Come here.

529
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,264
Holy shit. This is our table.

530
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,984
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

531
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,439
We kind of have, huh?

532
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,803
Our Lady gave me a mission to...

533
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,039
I sound like a nut-job.

534
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,005
Kind of.

535
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,040
What's the mission?

536
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,816
She said it was my destiny

537
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,150
to basically find

538
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,588
a whole new kind of magic.

539
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,183
You know, she said
it was something

540
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,489
that couldn't be given.

541
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,893
It had to be found.

542
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,224
So, we have to find it.

543
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,102
And I bet you it's here.

544
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,668
So, I guess we're
off to see the Wizard.

545
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,306
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

546
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,867
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,

547
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,277
and then their mom dies, 1941.

548
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,781
Q, where are you
going with this?

549
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,784
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

550
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,843
but we do know when they open...

551
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,464
Every time the Chatwins go.

552
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,166
So, if we could just
find a way to get there,

553
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,455
then we could follow them in.

554
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,922
Look, all I know is time magic

555
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,158
is apparently a thing,

556
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,243
a thing that's been dicking
with us for the past 39 lifetimes.

557
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,964
So, I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

558
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,069
Wait, but that would put
us in past Fillory, right?

559
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,034
Fillory is magic.

560
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,234
Remember, Jane
falls in that swamp,

561
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,403
and then she comes
out 20 years later.

562
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,773
She strikes a deal with the
Watcher Woman to send her back.

563
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,951
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

564
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,581
I have an idea,

565
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,349
something Richard told me,

566
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,416
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

567
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,653
Brakebills.

568
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,119
Okay.

569
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,907
Uh, you just have to
be a registered student

570
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,524
in order to get
through the wards.

571
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,162
Alumni key.

572
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,762
Richard gave it to me.

573
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,304
This place is impossible.

574
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,104
How does anyone find anything?

575
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,536
There's a whole
wing on cat paintings.

576
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,244
What have you got? Anything?

577
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,382
The Book of Mike McCormick.

578
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,280
Novella, really.

579
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,584
He was actually a
Republican. Can you believe it?

580
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,287
But the worst part?

581
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,321
His life was happy.

582
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,722
Eliot, he's gone.

583
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,629
Why are you torturing yourself?

584
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,857
Because he's gone
and it's my fault.

585
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,735
And of all the
people in the world

586
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,705
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

587
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,436
What are you doing?

588
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,602
Putting the past behind me.

589
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,111
No, stop!

590
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,778
Look, he's had a
really bad week.

591
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,145
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

592
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,413
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library, forever.

593
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,349
It's one book.

594
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,551
No, it's a life.

595
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,456
They're irreplaceable.

596
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,058
No, wait!

597
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,197
What did you do?

598
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,323
Let's go.

599
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,835
"Bridge to ancient Rome."

600
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,035
"Bridge to the
Cretaceous Period."

601
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,602
Oh, hey, here's one. Uh...

602
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,781
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

603
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,480
Voyage of the <i>Titanic?</i>

604
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,376
Oh. Fun.

605
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,092
So, we're pretty sure
these things only go

606
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,755
to one specific
point in time and...

607
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,342
Once you lock a
date in, you're locked.

608
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,425
I mean, they use some tiny piece

609
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,859
of an incredibly rare element.

610
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,220
All got used up by the '70s.

611
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,956
Wait a minute.
Wait. Here's a thesis.

612
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,531
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

613
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,897
"Operation Die Fuehrer."

614
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,817
Guess no one
told them Hitler was

615
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,275
a pretty serious
battle Magician.

616
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,402
Yeah.

617
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,809
Yep, and Hitler killed them.

618
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,613
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

619
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,412
Uh, it's April 19th, 1942.

620
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,813
April 19th.

621
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:03,948
Yeah.

622
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,415
You remember the, uh...
Yeah, "The Flying Forest"?

623
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,824
Yeah, uh, Jane's
going into town.

624
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,626
She's looking for a
present for Martin.

625
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,325
April 21st, 1942.

626
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,662
Two days after this time bridge.

627
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:20,915
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

628
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,019
I never thought I'd say
it, but thank God for Hitler.

629
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,242
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

630
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:28,913
Yeah.

631
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,646
Earth fountain's blocked off.

632
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,978
I told you it would be.

633
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,513
It was worth a shot.

634
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,920
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

635
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,434
I don't know. How about
not get us kicked out

636
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,778
of the library in
the first place?

637
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,359
All right, let's keep moving.

638
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,720
Hey. Not one more step.

639
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,437
We're highly trained
Earth Magicians.

640
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,098
Hold up. Hold up. You
guys are from Brakebills?

641
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,263
Dude, Josh
Hoberman, class of '16.

642
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,952
Come with me if
you want to live.

643
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,547
I've always wanted to say that.

644
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,643
But seriously, um, we should go.

645
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,381
Welcome to <i>Chez</i> Hoberman.

646
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,490
You're welcome to whatever.

647
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,087
Just don't eat the carrots.

648
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,290
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

649
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,300
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

650
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,826
Holy shit.

651
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,965
This tastes like pizza.

652
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,503
Yeah, I know, right?

653
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,086
How long have you
been down here?

654
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,369
A few weeks.

655
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,769
Just been camped out,

656
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,454
waiting to see if
anyone else will show up.

657
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,379
Anyone else? From my class.

658
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,879
Look, don't freak,

659
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,428
but back at Brakebills, nobody
knows what happened to you guys.

660
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,047
And it's sort of been two years.

661
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,554
Oh, shit. Right, the
whole time thing.

662
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,463
Victoria warned me about that.
- Victoria?

663
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,959
You know her?

664
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,794
She's the only reason I'm alive.

665
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,708
Look, are you gonna
tell us what the fuck

666
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,166
happened to your class, or what?

667
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,197
Where'd you guys go? To Fillory.

668
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:58,829
For spring break.

669
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,939
V's amazing.

670
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,133
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

671
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,803
<i>Teachers put this
tattoo on her to stop her.</i>

672
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,142
She just cut it off herself.

673
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,307
Joshy. What?

674
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,702
You're not gonna
believe it. What?

675
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,476
I did it. I found Fillory.

676
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,210
What? I found Fillory!

677
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,120
Oh, my God! We're
going to Fillory!

678
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,213
We're going to Fillory?

679
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,491
<i>So, we decided to plan a trip.</i>

680
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,494
<i>You know, party, smoke
out with the centaurs,</i>

681
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,462
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

682
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,294
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first-year class,</i>

683
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,061
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

684
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,830
<i>Luckily, V was so good, she
was able to take them all with.</i>

685
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,496
<i>It was magical.</i>

686
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,199
<i>I mean, more magical
than Brakebills,</i>

687
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,507
<i>like going from black
and white to color.</i>

688
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:44,342
V and I had a
threesome with a naiad.

689
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,716
This guy Donnie, he had
sex with a talking horse.

690
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,187
I mean, it's not
exactly taboo in Fillory,

691
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,615
since the animals
can give consent,

692
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,256
but we were all still
a bit squicked out.

693
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,089
We get it. You
fucked some animals.

694
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,156
How'd you end up here?

695
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,997
Got roped into this quest.

696
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,568
Ended up being
a trap for Victoria.

697
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,034
This dude, Mothra,
I've been calling him...

698
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,335
Yeah, we know that clown.

699
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,802
It was a bloodbath.

700
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,768
V zapped me here, and
then she went back in.

701
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,111
Told me to stay put, so
I have just been waiting.

702
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,318
V should have been here by now.

703
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,288
He caught her.

704
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:26,851
But she's still alive.

705
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,751
How do you know
that? I'm like her.

706
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,454
It's why I'm here.

707
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,494
We can all go, rescue Victoria.

708
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,590
You can take us.

709
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,529
Haven't exactly cracked

710
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,269
the whole ride-along, yet.

711
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,872
Okay, forget traveling.

712
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,435
Uh, we'll just take a fountain.

713
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,543
Except we don't know
where the Fillory fountain is.

714
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,682
That's easy.

715
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,494
It's three squares
up, one square left.

716
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,454
The problem is all the
battle magic dick buckets

717
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,921
waiting to vaporize us.

718
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,114
Discuss.

719
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,330
It's in the closet.

720
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,427
El and Margo made a door
to their favorite pub in London.

721
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,464
They look like fun.

722
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,717
Look, you were
supposed to be here.

723
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,085
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

724
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,634
No, you know, I
think Jane was right.

725
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,689
Had I been here living it up,

726
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:22,857
I would have never felt the need

727
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,611
to figure out what
magic is actually for.

728
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,809
Okay, so what's
magic actually for, then?

729
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,013
For fixing things, dummy.

730
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:33,850
Trust me.

731
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,518
I, uh, made a lot of mistakes

732
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,687
before I figured that one out.

733
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,997
Yeah, everything I've been
able to fix doesn't matter,

734
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,264
just minor mendings
and bullshit.

735
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,570
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

736
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,265
everyone would do it.

737
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,467
Come on.

738
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,171
Alice.

739
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,610
Get some sleep.

740
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,417
I know.

741
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,086
I might as well.

742
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,583
I'll never figure this out.

743
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,049
Trying to think of how to get
us all to the Fillory fountain

744
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,389
without getting us killed.

745
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,559
Need a hand?

746
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,665
Look, Penny,

747
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,639
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea, but...

748
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,198
Stop.

749
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,942
It was fun, okay?

750
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,379
You're one of the few
people I actually respect.

751
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,510
Uh, yeah, you're right, right.

752
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,915
I'm just making this weird, huh?

753
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,616
Eh, it's weird.

754
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,118
We're weird. So, what?

755
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,455
We're friends, right?

756
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,595
I just keep thinking
about Quentin.

757
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,598
Look, I know.

758
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,613
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

759
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,641
if, out of all of us,

760
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,701
he was the one who
didn't get to see Fillory.

761
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,642
And then I remember
that I hate him.

762
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,248
Fuck, why am I such an idiot?

763
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,545
Okay.

764
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,545
Quentin is irrelevant.

765
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,420
Just another excuse for
that thing you always do.

766
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,320
What thing? "I
should just give up.

767
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,395
"I'll never figure it out."

768
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,890
Shit got real.

769
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,360
If you're gonna
drop that bullshit,

770
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,593
now's the time.

771
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,331
<i>Phosphoromancy.</i>

772
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,069
I can bend light around us, all
of us, the whole group, I think,

773
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,000
make us invisible.

774
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,644
It'll be difficult with the
two suns but not impossible.

775
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,589
We'll have to move in
a pretty tight formation.

776
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,613
When should we leave?

777
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,842
As soon as possible.

778
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,475
The suns are just
about in position.

779
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,152
It has begun!

780
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,053
Sorry.

781
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,680
Penny, Eliot, you're both tall,

782
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,134
so, you'll have to duck down
and stay close to me, okay?

783
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,558
Or they'll see you. Got it.

784
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,755
We got it, right?

785
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,763
Mmm-hmm.

786
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,830
Eliot, are you coming?

787
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,429
Right behind you, Bambi.

788
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,440
Let's do this.

789
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,278
Okay.

790
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,392
Holy shit.

791
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,556
Is that an air raid siren?

792
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,659
Okay.

793
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,368
1942.

794
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,170
We need to get out of here.

795
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,668
Yeah.

796
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,640
Go to the right.

797
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,457
Is everything all right, Eliot?

798
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,626
Everything's amazing.

799
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,464
Go left. Go left.

800
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,814
Yeah, I brought a gun.

801
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,251
"Thanks, Margo."

802
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,723
You're welcome.
Why didn't you move?

803
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,059
Acid carrots.

804
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,400
Margo, you saved my actual life.

805
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,128
Hooray, you live to
drink another day.

806
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,682
Shit, guys, they see us.

807
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,368
Shit! Go! Go!

808
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,809
Oh, my God.

809
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,474
She looks so young.

810
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,279
Yeah, she's got no
idea what's coming.

811
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,778
Hey.

812
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,946
That's gotta be it, right?

813
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,765
Across the street,
the door to Fillory?

814
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,984
Yeah.

815
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,422
Here she comes.

816
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:43,993
You ready, Janey?

817
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,502
Why, yes, Martin, I think I am.

818
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,924
Oh, my God.

819
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,093
Q.

820
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,562
Look.
