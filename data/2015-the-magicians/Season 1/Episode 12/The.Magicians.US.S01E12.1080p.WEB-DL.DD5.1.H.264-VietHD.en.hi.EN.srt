00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,554
          You've managed to slip
     truth serum to me 27 times,

454
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,390
                        27 ways,
       and I'm quite sick of it.

455
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,592
- So, what,
this is just some

456
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,227
giant, blood-soaked
"Groundhog Day"?

457
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,729
           - You always bring up
             that fu**ing movie.

458
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,464
        I still haven't seen it.

459
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,565
                      [chuckles]

460
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,334
      Now it's a point of pride.

461
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,735
- Answer my question.

462
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,337
                 - In each loop,

463
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,740
           Jane alters something

464
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,643
                 to see if it'll
             change the outcome.

465
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,478
         The sigil that appeared
                   on your hand,

466
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,146
          brought you to Alice--

467
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,249
            that was Jane trying
        to get the ball rolling,

468
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,918
           trying to get you all
         together, working fast,

469
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,187
        and we all know how well
      that particular great idea

470
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,956
           worked out, don't we?

471
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,758
- So has anything
actually helped?

472
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,861
         - So far, all the loops
              end in your death.

473
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,463
- How many times
have I died?

474
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,931
                           - 39.

475
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,933
- 39 times.

476
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,801
        - And if you die a 40th,

477
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,203
                at least I won't
                have to hear you

478
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,872
            ask me this question
                     ever again.

479
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,775
           Jane's dead, Quentin.

480
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,277
                The loop's done.

481
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,513
                  There's no one
                    to reset it.

482
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,348
- So this is it?

483
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,017
        - This isn't my problem.

484
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,019
              My problem is that
               I'm strong enough

485
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,121
          to discern a time loop

486
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,889
           but not strong enough
                   to change it.

487
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,557
         We better hope and pray

488
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,460
     that Jane altered the right
         thing this time around.

489
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,663
         Anything else, Quentin?

490
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,598
- What's different this time?

491
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,138
- Please, no books
on the floor.

492
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,046
I love this one.

493
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,916
Photos from places
I can't imagine.

494
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,752
I know you hate it now,

495
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,755
but travelers wrote
our most precious books.

496
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,692
The library is what it is
because of them.

497
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,661
             - You make it sound
              so simple and fun.

498
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,430
- No.

499
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,165
But it is valuable.

500
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,733
And in my observation,

501
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,537
master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

502
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,375
                 - I was looking
          for any technical info

503
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,244
      that would get me anywhere
         close to mastery, but--

504
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,914
- The books you seek
are in another branch.

505
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,883
           - Of course they are.

506
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,053
               Look, could you--
   could you expedite that shit?

507
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,788
         I don't have much time,

508
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,891
       and I really need to know
     how to take people with me.

509
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,394
- I'll put in a request.

510
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,463
          - Why am I not feeling
                     optimistic?

511
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,465
- Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote "The Trial"

512
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,935
after spending a week
in the library.

513
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:29,373
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

514
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,642
you will get
a handle on it.

515
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,579
I promise.

516
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,647
             - If?

517
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,417
            Say that in my book?

518
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,488
- No spoilers.

523
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,122

524
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,459
Or you were,
like, 39 times.

525

You were the thing
they changed.

526

Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

527
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,465
and you would get stronger,

better than I would have.

Where is she?

- From?

                    We summoned,
                   and she came.

00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,822
- You mean, um, here?

570
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,625
To your loft?

571
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,128

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,431
                     That is why

00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,822
             Who did this magic?

581
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,925
- I told you.
She did.

582
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,794
I mean, it was crazy.

583
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,664
It was like being
on a massive dose of ecstasy.

584
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,299
When she touched me,

585
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,535
it was like my psyche
was defragging.

00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,704
I mean, she--
she touched all of us.

She granted every petition.

She cured Menolly's

she sent Richard

590
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,280
I watched this.

591
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,148
               - I thought magic
           couldn't cure cancer.

592
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,950
- Not regular magic.

593
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,386
Look, I can't lie, okay?

594
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,623
It was shitty going

        not being in Brakebills,

596

              anything but fate.

598
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,166
- Right, or just the right
random combination.

599
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,602
          - Okay, suit yourself,

00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,310
I don't know
how to get back,

602
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,813
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

603
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,016
and I just--I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

604
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,184
and I have to find
a way, um--

605
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,519
     - Let me get this straight.

606
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,990
             You want me to come
            to Fillory with you.

607
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,026
- Uh, yeah.

608
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,564
                    - Come here.

609
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,401
- Holy shit.
This is our table.

610
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,870
         - Kind of been planning
   this trip since we were nine.

611
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,571
- We kind of have, huh?

612
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,341
              - Our Lady gave me
                  a mission to--

613
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,543
          I sound like a nutjob.

614
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,578
           - Kind of.
          - [chuckles]

615
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,682
- What's the mission?

616
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,718
                      - She said
               it was my destiny

617
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,121
               to basically find
      a whole new kind of magic.

618
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,290
              You know, she said
                it was something

619
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,459
         that couldn't be given.

620
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,795
             It had to be found.

621
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:55,965
          So we have to find it.

622
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,767
        And I bet you it's here.

623
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,804
     - So I guess we're off
       to see the Wizard.

624
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,473
  - Have you given any thought
 to how we're gonna get there?

625
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,942
- Start of the London Blitz,
1940,

626
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,211
and then their mom dies,
1941.

627
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,879
              - Q, where are you
                going with this?

628
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,782
- Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

629
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,452
but we do know
when they open--

630
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,786
every time
the Chatwins go.

631
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,421
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

632
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,590
then we could
follow 'em in.

633
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,125
                         - Uh...

634
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:26,096
- Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

635
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,264
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

636
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,067
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

637
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,970
   - Wait, but that would put us
         in past Fillory, right?

638
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,139
- Fillory is magic.

639
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,808
Remember,
Jane falls in that swamp,

640
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,577
and then she comes out
20 years later.

641
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,746
She strikes a deal
with the Watcherwoman

642
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,681
to send her back.

643
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:49,152
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

644
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,820
               - I have an idea,

645
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,422
      something Richard told me,

646
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,091
               but we have to go
            somewhere to get it.

647
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,860
                     Brakebills.

648
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,194
- Okay.

649
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,929
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

650
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,298
in order to get
through the wards.

651
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,467
                   - Alumni key.

652
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,036
          Richard gave it to me.

653
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,506
  - This place is impossible.

654
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,274
        How does anyone
         find anything?

655
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,877
      There's a whole wing
       on cat paintings.

656
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,546
What have you got?
Anything?

657
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,481
- "The Book of
Mike McCormick."

658
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,483
                Novella, really.

659
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,622
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

660
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,457
             But the worst part?

661
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,526
His life was happy.

662
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,960
- Eliot, he's gone.

663
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,729
Why are you
torturing yourself?

664
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:36,166
      - Because he's gone
       and it's my fault.

665
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,867
           And of all the people
                    in the world

666
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,837
     who don't understand,
   somehow you top the list.

667
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,341
     - What are you doing?
 - Putting the past behind me.

668
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,644
- [gasps]
No, stop!

669
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,978
- Look, he's had
a really bad week.

670
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,580
      We'll pay the fine,
           whatever.

671
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,583
    - Nope, no, you are banished
       from the library forever.

672
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,652
                - It's one book.

673
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,720
              - No, it's a life.

674
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,522
They're irreplaceable.

675
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,658
                     - No, wait!

676
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,329
- What did you do?

677
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,365
          - Let's go.

678
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,004
  <i> - "Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

679
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,942
           "Bridge to
    the Cretaceous period."

680
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,543
            Oh, hey, here's one.

681
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,046
          "Southampton, England,
                          1912"?

682
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,548
- [laughs]
Voyage of the "Titanic."

683
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,250
                      - Oh, fun.

684
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,885
            So we're pretty sure
            these things only go

685
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,020
                 to one specific
             point in time and--

686
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,856
- Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

687
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:36,025
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

688
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,294
All got used up
by the '70s.

689
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,796
Wait a minute.

690
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,865
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

691
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,568
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

692
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,738
      - "Operation Die Fuehrer."
                        [scoffs]

693
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,873
           Guess no one told 'em
                      Hitler was

694
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,407
                a pretty serious
                battle Magician?

695
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,909
- Yeah.

696
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,978
Uh, yep,
and Hitler killed them.

697
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,479
         - Wait, what's the date
             on the time bridge?

698
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,216
- Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

699
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,919
                   - April 19th.

700
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,754
- Yeah.

701
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,658
        - You remember the, uh--
      yeah, "The Flying Forest."

702
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,994
                       Yeah, uh,
         Jane's going into town.

703
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,830
               She's looking for
           a present for Martin.

704
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,600
                 April 21, 1942.

705
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,602
- Two days after
this time bridge.

706
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,471
Holy shit, Q,
this could work.

707
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,740
   - I never thought I'd say it,
       but thank God for Hitler.

708
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:27,810
- Yeah, no, that
still sounds bad.

709
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,345
                         - Yeah.

710
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,850
- Earth fountain's
blocked off.

711
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,118
   - I told you it would be.

712
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,319
- It was worth a shot.

713
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,021
       I mean, what else
        are we gonna do?

714
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,622
- I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

715
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,157
of the library
in the first place?

716
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,326
                    - All right,
              let's keep moving.

717
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,929
              Hey.
   Don't walk one more step.

718
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,697
            We're highly trained
                Earth magicians.

719
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,166
      - Hold up. Hold up.
 You guys are from Brakebills?

720
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,136
      Dude, Josh Hoberman,
         class of '16.

721
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,305
          Come with me
      if you want to live.

722
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,307
       I've always wanted
          to say that.

723
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,641
                      [chuckles]

724
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,845
       But seriously, um,
         we should go.

725
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,949
        <i> [dramatic music]</i>

726
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,455
     [electricity buzzing]

727
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,390
You're welcome to whatever.

728
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,992
Just don't eat the carrots.

729
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,162
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

730
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,332
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

731
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,033
          - Holy shit.

732
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,735
    This tastes like pizza.

733
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,236
- Yeah, I know, right?

734
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,671
             - How long have you
                 been down here?

735
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,173
- A few weeks.

736
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,574
Just been camped out,

737
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,042
waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

738
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,177
                  - Anyone else?

739
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,678
- From my class.

740
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
            - Look, don't freak,
         but back at Brakebills,

741
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,048
      nobody knows what happened
                    to you guys.

742
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,684
- And it's sort of
been two years.

743
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,153
- Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

744
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,655
Victoria warned me
about that.

745
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,425
                     - Victoria?
                   You know her?

746
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,394
- She's the only reason
I'm alive.
