<i>Jesus, we could not</i>

4

<i>That spell worse,</i>
<i>and we can't take it back.</i>

5
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,530
<i>- It's just you showed up</i>
<i>with that sigil on your hand.</i>

6
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:08,932
<i>- It appeared when i was</i>

7
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,934
<i>It came from jane.</i>
Who are you?

8
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,369
I'm a member of the order,

9
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:14,137
The keepers of the libraries
of the neitherlands.

10
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:15,538
Any idea who the motherfu**ers
in the hoods are,

11
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:16,740
<i>Trying to kill me?</i>

12
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:17,941
They've been
thoroughly cursed,

13
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,743
So they can't
use the fountains,

14
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:21,211
But that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment.

15
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,779
The beast?

16
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,614
We are the best magicians
we know,

17
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,316
But menolly is dying.

18
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:27,984
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

19
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,052
And you?

20
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,120
Eight years ago,

21
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,454
I was a drug addict,

22
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,092
And i left my son
in a hot car.

23
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,227
We're not learning
anything new.

24
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:38,561
Beast always kills us.

25
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,397
There was one time
we didn't all die--

26
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:42,065
When we went to fillory.

27
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>Point is, we need</i>
<i>some serious battle magic.</i>

28
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,235
Bottling our emotions...

29
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,103

Bring him three gifts.
He'll show you the way.

34
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,727

Yeah.

40

Die, fu**er!

41
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,070
Well, that sucked ass.

42
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:57,173
Julia, kady!

43

Finally.
<i>Bienvenidas.</i>

44

45
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:04,147
Oh, no, no, no.
Just passing the time.

46
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,315
So...

47
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,517
Uh, yeah, um...

48

We bring forsythia...

49
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,421
Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:14,257
And honeycomb.

51
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,092
Hmm.

52
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,228
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

53
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,396
<i>Muy bien, chicas.</i>

54
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,931
<i>Muy bien.</i>

55

56
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,668
Where's the platinum?

57
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,036
We didn't bring that.

58
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,339
Too bad.
Exit through the gift shop.

59
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:34,210
But we did bring something
of great and shining worth.

60
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,513
Just say it.

61
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,581
If you're wrong,
you're wrong.

62
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:45,688
We brought you our faith.

63
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,690
Ooh.

64
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:48,925
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,695
Tricky, tricky,
tricky, tricky.

66
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,264
I like it.

67
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,267
But to be honest,
i'm sensing more skepticism

68
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,203
Than faith here.

69
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,571


70
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:04,974
Look, um, i'm trying.

71
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,743
She's the one
that had the dream, okay?

72
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,811
Hey.

73
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:12,815
Kady, your mother
used your faith,

74
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,819
But she isn't
your true mother.

75
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:19,889
Our lady feels
you require a miracle.

76
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,665


77
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:33,836
Oh, my god.

78
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:35,572
Wha--what ha--

79
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:36,940
What did he do?

80
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:37,941
I don't--
i don't know.

81
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,309
I've had this tightness

82
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,279
Ever since my mom,
but it's gone.

83
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:46,849
Ah, there it is.

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,720
Faith.

85
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,257
Okay, so...

86
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,926
Let's get to brass.

87
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,295
You're here why?

88
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:02,098
We seek an audience
with our lady underground.

89
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,200
Yeah, no shit.

90
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:07,337
Why do you think
you deserve to see her?

91
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,874
Hmm?
It's okay.

92
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,944
Why should she waste
her time with you?

93
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,347
I am privileged,

94
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,048
And i have done
some stupid shit,

95
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,850
And i have been
through nothing

96
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,452
Compared to some
of my friends.

97
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,120
So you wish
to help them?

98
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:26,022
Heal them?
Is that it?

99
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,325
Yes, that is exactly
what i want to do.

100
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:31,661
No.

101
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:32,895
No, no, no.

102
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,233
Magicians...

103
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,902
That's all you ever want,
power, every time.

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,573
You know what?

105
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,375
For the longest time,

106
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,811
That is all i wanted.

107
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,380
But now i just want to do

108
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,548
Whatever the fu** it is
i'm supposed to.

109
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,718
And if she's around,
if she gives a shit,

110
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,488
I have to believe
she wants her daughters

111
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,824
To show a little ambition.

112
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,230
So you tell her
that i am trying

113
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,666
To reach something higher.

114
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:14,003
<i> Nuestra seÃ±ora</i>
sits and waits,

115

She watches.

117
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:22,111
She weeps.

118
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:26,849
But today, she's
grinning like a fool.

119
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:29,252
Here's the invocation.

00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,221

be with you.

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,586
About to change...

186
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:52,889
Everything,

187
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,457
Finally.

188
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:58,160
Yeah.
Cheers.

189
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:06,836
what?

190
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:08,604
Okay, you are
the least crazy.

191
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,506
Tell me what's going on.

192
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,209
It--nothing.
Just forget it.

193
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,245
What the hell
are you drinking?

194
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,014
I don't know.

195
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,082
Triple sec?

196
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:21,951
What did quentin do?

197
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:23,352
I don't want
to talk about it.

198
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:25,688
Fair enough.

199
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:28,391
Can i get some?

200
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,669
It's good.

201
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,703
It's not good.

202
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:42,371
No, it's not good.

203
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,707
Yeah.

204
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,542
Let you in on
a little secret, though.

205
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:50,279
I used to drink midori
in high school.

206
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:54,383
It's like melon
crossed with perfume

207
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,186
Crossed with ass.

208
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,287
Yum.

209
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:00,323
Fu** did i know?

210
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:03,793
I was trying to get
the voices to go away.

211
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:08,197
Point is, i'm not judging
anyone for triple sec.

212
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:12,802
And...

213
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:16,205
I can tell when someone's trying
to make something go away.

214
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:23,045
So midori, hmm?

215
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,047
Does it work?

216
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,918
Nothing works forever.

217
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:31,253
But, you know,

218
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:35,257
If you stop worrying
about forever,

219
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,760
There's plenty of shit that can
get you through the next hour.

220
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,231

and indistinct chatter]

Is what he said
still bugging you?

223
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,546
He looked at me like
he could see through me.

224
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,783
And kady doesn't seem
to share your reservation.

225
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:04,387
She seems better.

226
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,888
Yeah.

227
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:09,258
I don't know why
i feel this way.

228
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,427
Our lady came to me
in a dream.

229
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,596
Shouldn't that
remove all doubt?

230
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,465
Look, something like this
is about intention,

231
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,567
What we bring into it.

232
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,736
Our intentions are pure.

233
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,238
So just stop worrying?

234
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,305
Yeah.

235
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,740
Just like...

236
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,909
For now.

237
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,878
Tomorrow you can worry
all you want

238
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,279
About our lady underground.

239
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,914
Tonight...

240
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,716
Tonight should be
about dionysus.

241
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,117
Whoo, ooh.

242
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,454
dionysus, okay.

243
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,056
You, uh...

244
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,925
You bang a lot of undergrads
with that one?

245
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Fewer than i'd hoped.

246
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:56,172

247
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,955
Hmm?
Say it works.

248
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,591
And that means
what for you?

249
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:17,193
You asking
if i'm coming back?

250
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:20,062
Kind of, yeah.

251
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,332
I hadn't much
planned for it really.

252
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,368
I just want
to get there,

253
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:29,839
And i'll stay
or go somewhere quiet.

254
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,142
If our lady
has other plans, hmm,

255
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,111
I'll do that.

256
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,346
I'll miss you.

257
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,615
I'll miss you too.

258
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:45,555
To think you were
so crabby in rehab,

259
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,190
We almost never spoke.

260
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:49,859
Hey.

261
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,162
God, you are really
something, julia.

262
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:54,864
I bet you say that
to all the girls

263
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,999
You slept with
three minutes ago.

264
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,835
That's funny.
Hmm.

265
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,571
But i mean it.
I do.

266
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,406
That bite, that--

267
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:05,541
That thing in you that wants
to puzzle everything out,

268
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,311
That is gold.

269
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,915
No matter how crabby
it makes me?

270
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,718
I think especially
when it makes you crabby.

271
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,521
I think that us angry,

272
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:21,424
Questioning people
sometimes shut up too fast,

273
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,395
And that is probably part
of why the gods took off.

274
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,065
No one around with the fire

275
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,235
To keep yelling their names.

276
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,504
This is gonna sound corny,

277
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:37,240
But don't lose that fire.

278
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,009
Well, it sounds like
you're saying good-bye.

279
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,178
I'm saying thank you.

280
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,051
So this is a little hitch
in our adventure.

281
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:51,120
Are we just gonna act
like children now?

282
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:53,389
Now, now, bambi.
He's got a right to be mad.

283
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:54,690
No, he doesn't.

284
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:56,025
People don't get
to be mad at me

285
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,560
Because i had sex
with them.

286
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,896
You're welcome,
both of you.

287
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,197
Oh, come on.

288
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,432
We were all messed up
on emotion magic.

289
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,934
We deserve a pass.

290
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,202
I don't need a pass.

291
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:07,637
You two have
ruined my life.

292
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:08,938
No offense, quentin,

293
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,573
But i think you did that
all yourself.

294
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,708
Can we just cut to the part
where we go to another world

295
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:16,913
And skip the whole guilt
and recriminations bit, please?

296
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:19,782
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

297
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,952
Is it wrong that i'm starting
to side with the beast?

Didn't think
you had that in you.

You don't get
to shame me.

308
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,784
You slept with two other people.
We broke up.

309

I was out of my mind.

310
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,723
I made a mistake,

311
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,157
And you aimed a weapon.

I'm glad it hurt.
It should hurt.

But the fact is,

316
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,635
According to the best
and only magic we have,

317
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,870
We have to go
or the beast will kill us.

00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,972
You understand,
of course.

370
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,411
I planned my whole outfit
around that bottle!

371
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,754
Could you get
to the point, quentin?

372
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,423
I have a trustees meeting.

373
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,625
You know something about
what's been happening here--

374
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,194
The beast, eliza.

375
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,997
I would like to know
what is really going on here.

376
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,632
I know you would,

377
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,434
But we are done.

378
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:24,636
How did you lose
your virginity?

379
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:26,771
I was 24 years old.

380
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,373
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

381
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,308
She was considerably
older than i

382
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:33,778
And, oh, much, much
more experienced.

383
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,448
But...

384
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,717
Fu**!

385
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,219
You've managed to dose me,
haven't you?

386
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:44,489
In my tea.
You little shit.

387
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:48,493
Truth serum is toxic,
quentin, and banned.

388
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,161
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

389
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:52,531
You would have done so already,
but you haven't.

390
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,966
Eliza...

391
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,368
Who is she?

392
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,405
Eliza's real name
is jane chatwin.

393
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,208
Oh...

394
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,243
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

395
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,847
Uh...

396
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:11,216
Okay, what does jane
have to do with the beast?

397
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,185
Do you remember the gift
that jane was given in the book

398
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,688
"the girl who told time"?

399
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:20,825
Uh, yeah, ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

400
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,762
Ember gave her the ability
to fu** with time

401
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,363
On a cosmic scale,

402
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,099
And jane used it
to create a time loop.

403
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,602
When she'd fail
to stop the beast,

404
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:32,170
She'd restart the loop.

405
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:33,705
A time loop.

406
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,007
Okay.

407
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:38,009
Uh...

408
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:41,279
So what do we have to do
with the beast?

409
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,847
You just keep
getting involved.

410
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,716
I don't keep doing anything.

411
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,251
Can you imagine,
quentin,

412
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:51,089
How many times we've had
this exact conversation?

413
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,693
You've managed to slip
truth serum to me 27 times,

414
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,529
27 ways,
and i'm quite sick of it.

415
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:58,730
So, what,
this is just some

416
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,365
Giant, blood-soaked
"groundhog day"?

417
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,867
You always bring up
that fu**ing movie.

418
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,603
I still haven't seen it.

419
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,472
Now it's a point of pride.

420
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:08,873
Answer my question.

421
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,475
In each loop,

422
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,878
Jane alters something

423
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,781
To see if it'll
change the outcome.

424
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,617
The sigil that appeared
on your hand,

425
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,285
Brought you to alice--

426
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,387
That was jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

427
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:25,056
Trying to get you all
together, working fast,

428
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,325
And we all know how well
that particular great idea

429
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:30,095
Worked out, don't we?

430
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,896
So has anything
actually helped?

431
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:35,000
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

432
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:36,601
How many times
have i died?

433
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:38,069
39.

434
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:40,071
39 times.

435
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,940
And if you die a 40th,

436
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,341
At least i won't
have to hear you

437
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:46,011
Ask me this question
ever again.

438
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:48,913
Jane's dead, quentin.

439
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,415
The loop's done.

440
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,652
There's no one
to reset it.

441
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,487
So this is it?

442
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,155
This isn't my problem.

443
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,157
My problem is that
i'm strong enough

444
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,259
To discern a time loop

445
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:03,028
But not strong enough
to change it.

446
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:04,696
We better hope and pray

447
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:07,599
That jane altered the right
thing this time around.

448
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:09,801
Anything else, quentin?

449
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,703
What's different this time?

450
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,243
Please, no books
on the floor.

451
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:26,184
I love this one.

452
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:30,055
Photos from places
i can't imagine.

453
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,891
I know you hate it now,

454
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:35,894
But travelers wrote
our most precious books.

455
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,830
The library is what it is
because of them.

456
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,800
You make it sound
so simple and fun.

457
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,568
No.

458
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:45,303
But it is valuable.

459
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:46,871
And in my observation,

460
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,642
Master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

461
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,513
I was looking
for any technical info

462
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,383
That would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but--

463
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,052
The books you seek
are in another branch.

464
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,022
Of course they are.

465
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:07,192
Look, could you--
could you expedite that shit?

466
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:08,927
I don't have much time,

467
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:12,030
And i really need to know
how to take people with me.

468
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,532
I'll put in a request.

469
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:16,601
Why am i not feeling
optimistic?

470
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,603
Probably because
franz kafka wrote "the trial"

471
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:22,073
After spending a week
in the library.

472
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,511
But, penny, if you can
survive long enough,

473
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:29,781
You will get
a handle on it.

474
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:32,717
I promise.

475
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:34,786
If?

476
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,522
Say that in my book?

477
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,593
No spoilers.

478
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,800
<i></i>

479
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:07,685
Hi.

480
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,601
You were supposed to be.

481
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,938
Or you were,
like, 39 times.

482
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:20,740
You were the thing
they changed.

483
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,909
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

484
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:24,944
And you would get stronger,
and--

485
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,280
So i was right.

486
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,415
The whole time,
i was right.

487
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,317
I don't know
what to say, jules.

488
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,886
I...

489
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:35,288
I should have
believed you, jules.

490
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:38,958
I should have known,
and i'm--i'm...

491
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:41,127
Um...

492
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:44,964
Look, that doesn't make up
for what i did to you,

493
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:49,001
Which was stupid

494
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:52,305
And vindictive

495
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,209
And really dangerous.

496
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,812
I'm so sorry, q.

497
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,347
Thank you.

498
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:06,052
So how do we fix it?

499
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,222
I don't know.

500
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,957
I just know that
i'm gonna get killed soon,

501
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,959
And i don't
really want to die

502
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:17,196
Being mad
at my oldest friend.

503
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,998
I really fu**ing
missed you.

504
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,933
Yeah, me, too, actually.

505
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:31,878
You smell the same.

506
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,917
Okay, all right.

507
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,318
Uh...

508
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,921
So...

509
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,756
Big conspiracy.

510
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,158
Wheels within wheels.

511
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:47,660
Julia doesn't go
to brakebills, and?

512
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:51,898
You're taking this a lot
better than i would have.

513
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:56,169
It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

514
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,838
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit i've seen.

515
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:01,507
I can barely believe it.

516
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:05,378
Wha--what?

517
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:08,281
Some friends and i got into
some pretty eclectic shit.

518
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,082
You and kady?

519
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,118
Where is she?

520
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,053
On a mission.

521
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:16,856
They all are.

522
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:19,058
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

523
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:20,726
From?

524
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:23,629
A goddess.

525
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,433
We summoned,
and she came.

526
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,302
You mean, um, here?

527
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,104
To your loft?

528
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,607
You don't believe me.
Shit, i wouldn't either.

529
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:37,877
That is why
she gave me proof.

530
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,418
Is that milk?

531
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:46,419
Yeah.

532
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,720
Cool,

533
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:48,788
Useless,

534
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,122
Kind of gross.

535
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:53,726
But look under the hood.

536
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,600
Oh, my god.

537
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,301
Who did this magic?

538
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:05,404
I told you.
She did.

539
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,273
I mean, it was crazy.

540
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:11,143
It was like being
on a massive dose of ecstasy.

541
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,778
When she touched me,

542
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,014
It was like my psyche
was defragging.

543
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,183
I mean, she--
she touched all of us.

544
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,418
She granted every petition.

545
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,687
She cured menolly's
breast cancer;

546
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,191
She sent richard
to where he wanted to go.

547
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,759
I watched this.

548
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,628
I thought magic
couldn't cure cancer.

549
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:30,429
Not regular magic.

550
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,865
Look, i can't lie, okay?

551
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,102
It was shitty going
for a while there,

552
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,503
Not being in brakebills,

553
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,972
But i can't sit here now

554
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:43,009
And think it was
anything but fate.

555
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:46,646
Right, or just the right
random combination.

556
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,048
Okay, suit yourself,
nihilist.

557
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:54,954
I need your help.

558
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:56,789
I don't know
how to get back,

559
00:27:56,824 --> 00:28:00,293
And, um, my friends,
we got separated,

560
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:02,495
And i just--i can't let them
fight the beast on their own,

561
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,664
And i have to find
a way, um--

562
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:05,998
Let me get this straight.

563
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:10,469
You want me to come
to fillory with you.

564
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,471
Uh, yeah.

565
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:18,044
Come here.

566
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,880
Holy shit.
This is our table.

567
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:23,349
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

568
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:25,051
We kind of have, huh?

569
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:27,820
Our lady gave me
a mission to--

570
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:30,022
I sound like a nutjob.

571
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,058
Kind of.

572
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:35,161
What's the mission?

573
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:38,197
She said
it was my destiny

574
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:41,601
To basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

575
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,769
You know, she said
it was something

576
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,938
That couldn't be given.

577
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,274
It had to be found.

578
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,445
So we have to find it.

579
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,246
And i bet you it's here.

580
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:57,283
So i guess we're off
to see the wizard.

581
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,952
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

582
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,421
Start of the london blitz,
1940,

583
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,690
And then their mom dies,
1941.

584
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:06,359
Q, where are you
going with this?

585
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:09,261
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to fillory,

586
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,931
But we do know
when they open--

587
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:13,265
Every time
the chatwins go.

588
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:14,900
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

589
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:17,069
Then we could
follow 'em in.

590
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,604
Uh...

591
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,575
Look, all i know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

592
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,744
A thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

593
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,546
So i say we find a way
to make it work for us.

594
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:30,449
Wait, but that would put us
in past fillory, right?

595
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,618
Fillory is magic.

596
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:35,287
Remember,
jane falls in that swamp,

597
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,056
And then she comes out
20 years later.

598
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,225
She strikes a deal
with the watcherwoman

599
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,160
To send her back.

600
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:45,631
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

601
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,299
I have an idea,

602
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:48,901
Something richard told me,

603
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,570
But we have to go
somewhere to get it.

604
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,339
Brakebills.

605
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,674
Okay.

606
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,409
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

607
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,778
In order to get
through the wards.

608
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,946
Alumni key.

609
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:03,482
Richard gave it to me.

610
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:05,985
This place is impossible.

611
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,753
How does anyone
find anything?

612
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:10,356
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

613
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,025
What have you got?
Anything?

614
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,960
"the book of
mike mccormick."

615
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,929
Novella, really.

616
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,101
He was actually a republican.
Can you believe it?

617
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:23,936
But the worst part?

618
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:26,005
His life was happy.

619
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,440
Eliot, he's gone.

620
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,208
Why are you
torturing yourself?

621
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:32,645
Because he's gone
and it's my fault.

622
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,346
And of all the people
in the world

623
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:37,283
Who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

624
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,821
What are you doing?
Putting the past behind me.

625
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,123
no, stop!

626
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:45,458
Look, he's had
a really bad week.

627
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,059
We'll pay the fine,
whatever.

628
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,062
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

629
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,131
It's one book.

630
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,200
No, it's a life.

631
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:55,968
They're irreplaceable.

632
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,104
No, wait!

633
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,808
What did you do?

634
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,811
Let's go.

635
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:11,484
<i>- "bridge to ancient rome."</i>

636
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,421
"bridge to
the cretaceous period."

637
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,022
Oh, hey, here's one.

638
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,525
"southampton, england,
1912"?

639
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,027
voyage of the "titanic."

640
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:23,729
Oh, fun.

641
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,364
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

642
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,500
To one specific
point in time and--

643
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:29,335
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

644
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,505
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

645
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,774
All got used up
by the '70s.

646
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,275
Wait a minute.

647
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,344
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

648
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:42,047
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill hitler.

649
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:45,217
"operation die fuehrer."

650
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:46,352
Guess no one told 'em
hitler was

651
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:47,887
A pretty serious
battle magician?

652
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:49,388
Yeah.

653
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:51,457
Uh, yep,
and hitler killed them.

654
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,958
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

655
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,695
Uh, it's april 19, 1942.

656
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,398
April 19th.

657
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,233
Yeah.

658
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:05,137
You remember the, uh--
yeah, "the flying forest."

659
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,473
Yeah, uh,
jane's going into town.

660
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,309
She's looking for
a present for martin.

661
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:14,079
April 21, 1942.

662
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,081
Two days after
this time bridge.

663
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:17,950
Holy shit, q,
this could work.

664
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:20,219
I never thought i'd say it,
but thank god for hitler.

665
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:24,290
Yeah, no, that
still sounds bad.

666
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:25,791
Yeah.

667
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,329
Earth fountain's
blocked off.

668
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,597
I told you it would be.

669
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:32,798
It was worth a shot.

670
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,500
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

671
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,101
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

672
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:37,636
Of the library
in the first place?

673
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,805
All right,
let's keep moving.

674
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:42,408
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

675
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,176
We're highly trained
earth magicians.

676
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,645
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from brakebills?

677
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,615
Dude, josh hoberman,
class of '16.

678
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,784
Come with me
if you want to live.

679
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,786
I've always wanted
to say that.

680
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,325
But seriously, um,
we should go.

681
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,394
<i></i>

682
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,678
You're welcome to whatever.

683
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,280
Just don't eat the carrots.

684
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:15,450
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

685
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:18,620
Circumstances in the
neitherlands are super weird.

686
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,321
Holy shit.

687
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:22,023
This tastes like pizza.

688
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,524
Yeah, i know, right?

689
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,959
How long have you
been down here?

690
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:26,461
A few weeks.

691
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,862
Just been camped out,

692
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:29,330
Waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

693
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:30,465
Anyone else?

694
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,966
From my class.

695
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,768
Look, don't freak,
but back at brakebills,

696
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,336
Nobody knows what happened
to you guys.

697
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:37,972
And it's sort of
been two years.

698
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:40,441
Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

699
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,943
Victoria warned me
about that.

700
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,713
Victoria?
You know her?

701
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:47,682
She's the only reason
i'm alive.

702
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:49,417
Look are you
gonna tell us

703
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:51,219
What the fu** happened
to your class, or what?

704
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:52,320
Where'd you guys go?

705
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:53,554
To fillory

706
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,357
For spring break.

707
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:58,059
V's amazing.

708
00:33:58,094 --> 00:34:01,162
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

709
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:03,665
<i>Teachers put this tattoo</i>
<i>on her to stop her.</i>

710
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,533
She just cut it off herself.

711
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,901
Joshy.
What?

712
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,202
You're not gonna believe it.
What?

713
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:10,571
I did it.
I found fillory.

714
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:12,140
What?
I found fillory!

715
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,708
Oh, my god!
Whoo! We're going to fillory!

716
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:15,243
We're going to fillory?
uh-huh!

717
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:16,978
<i>- So we decided</i>
<i>to plan a trip.</i>

718
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,813
<i>You know, party,</i>
<i>smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

719
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,715
<i>Be back in time</i>
<i>for classes,</i>

720
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,217
<i>But word got out to practically</i>
<i>the whole first year class,</i>

721
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,019
<i>Except for a couple losers.</i>

722
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:26,487
<i>Luckily, v was so good,</i>

723
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,423
<i>She was able</i>
<i>to take them all with.</i>

724
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:30,558
<i>It was magical.</i>

725
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:32,860
<i></i>
<i>i mean, more magical</i>

726
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:34,429
<i>Than brakebills,</i>

727
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:37,699
<i>Like going from black and white</i>
<i>to color.</i>

728
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:40,101
V and i had a threesome
with a naiad.

729
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:43,771
This guy donnie, he had sex
with a talking horse.

730
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:46,040
I mean, it's not exactly
taboo in fillory

731
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:47,675
Since the animals
can give consent,

732
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,410
But we were all still
a bit squicked out.

733
00:34:49,446 --> 00:34:51,679
We get it.
You fu**ed some animals.

734
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,016
How'd you end up here?

735
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,251
Got roped
into this quest.

736
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:00,888
Ended up being a trap
for victoria.

737
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:04,025
This dude--mothra,
i've been calling him--

738
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,393
Yeah, we know that clown.

739
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:07,462
It was a bloodbath.

740
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:09,597
V zapped me here,
and then she went back in.

741
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:10,898
Told me to stay put,

742
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:14,235
So i have just been waiting.

743
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,438
V should have
been here by now.

744
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:21,776
He caught her.

745
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:22,977
But she's still alive.

746
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,579
How do you know that?

747
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:27,949
I'm like her.
It's why i'm here.

748
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:30,385
We can all go,
rescue victoria.

749
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,619
You can take us.

750
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:34,655
I...

751
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:37,558
Haven't exactly cracked

752
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,428
The whole ride-along yet.

753
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:41,829
Okay, forget traveling.

754
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,598
Uh, we'll just
take a fountain.

755
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:46,801
Except we don't know
where the fillory fountain is.

756
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:48,236
That's easy.

757
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,804
It's three squares up,
one square left.

758
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,273
The problem is all the
battle magic dick buckets

759
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,108
Waiting to vaporize us.

760
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:56,177
Discuss.

761
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:04,318
It's in the closet.

762
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:08,823
El and margo made a door
to their favorite pub in london.

763
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,159
They look like fun.

764
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,660
Look, you were supposed
to be here.

765
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:14,162
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

766
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:16,030
No, you know,
i think jane was right.

767
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:17,498
Had i been here
living it up,

768
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:19,100
I would have never
felt the need to figure out

769
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,668
What magic
is actually for.

770
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:23,037
Okay, so what's magic
actually for, then?

771
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:27,208
For fixing things, dummy.

772
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:29,944
Trust me.

773
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,546
I, uh, made
a lot of mistakes

774
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:33,815
Before i figured
that one out.

775
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,151
Yeah, everything i've been
able to fix doesn't matter,

776
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:40,321
Just minor mendings
and bullshit.

777
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:42,857
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

778
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:45,026
Everyone would do it.

779
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:47,095
Come on.

780
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,300
Alice.

781
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,136
Get some sleep.

782
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,804
I know.

783
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,306
I might as well.

784
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,975
I'll never figure this out.

785
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,978
Trying to think of how to get us
all to the fillory fountain

786
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,446
Without getting us killed.

787
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:12,220
Need a hand?

788
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:15,723
Look, penny,

789
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:18,659
I'm sorry if i gave you
the wrong idea, but--

790
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,028
Whoa, stop.

791
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:24,866
It was fun, okay?

792
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:28,236
You're one of the few people
i actually respect.

793
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:31,005
Uh, yeah,
you're right, right.

794
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm just making this
weird, huh?

795
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,042
Eh, it's weird.

796
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:38,312
We're weird.
So what?

797
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,517
We're friends, right?

798
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:48,890
I just keep thinking
about quentin.

799
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:50,591
Look, i know.

800
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:52,426
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

801
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,128
If, out of all of us,
he was the one

802
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:56,430
Who didn't get
to see fillory.

803
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:59,467
And then i remember
that i hate him.

804
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:01,369
Fu**, why am i
such an idiot?

805
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,770
Okay.

806
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:06,574
Quentin is irrelevant.

807
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,577
Just another excuse
for that thing you always do.

808
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:10,611
What thing?

809
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:11,779
"i should just give up.

810
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:13,414
I'll never figure it out."

811
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,249
Shit got real.

812
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:17,151
If you're gonna drop
that bullshit,

813
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:19,754
Now's the time.

814
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,422
<i>- Phosphoromancy.</i>

815
00:38:21,457 --> 00:38:23,824
I can bend light around us,
all of us,

816
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,326
The whole group, i think,

817
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,128
Make us invisible.

818
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:28,563
It'll be difficult
with the two suns

819
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,131
But not impossible.

820
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,566
We'll have to move
in a pretty tight formation.

821
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,667
When should we leave?

822
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:33,935
As soon as possible.

823
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,469
The suns are just about
in position.

824
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:37,672
It has begun!

825
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:39,106
Sorry.

826
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:40,975
Penny, eliot,
you're both tall,

827
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,944
So you'll have to duck down
and stay close to me, okay?

828
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:44,845
Or they'll see you.
Got it.

829
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:46,847
We got it, right?

830
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,185
Eliot, are you coming?

831
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:54,922
Right behind you,
bambi.

832
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,385
Let's do this.

833
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,387
Okay.

834
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,529
Holy shit.

835
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,901
Is that an air raid siren?

836
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,569
Okay.

837
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:27,972
1942.

838
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:29,407
We need to get
out of here.

839
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:30,408
Yeah.

840
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:39,050

Thanks, margo.

You're welcome.
Why didn't you move?

849
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:26,931
Acid carrots.

Margo, you saved
my actual life.
