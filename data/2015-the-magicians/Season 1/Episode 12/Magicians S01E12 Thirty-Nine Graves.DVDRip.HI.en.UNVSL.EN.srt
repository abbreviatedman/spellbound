anyone for triple sec.

And...

208
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,901
I can tell when someone's
trying to make something go away.

209
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,522

210

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,922
Damage always ensues.

366
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,529
(GLASS SHATTERING)

367
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,358
(ALL INHALE AND GROAN)

368
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,502
You understand, of course.

369
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,567
(ALL GROANING AND MOANING)

370
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,939
I planned my whole
outfit around that bottle!

371
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,278
Could you get to
the point, Quentin?

372
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,711
I have a trustees meeting.

373
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,085
You know something about
what's been happening here.

374
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,088
The Beast, Eliza.

375
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,551
I would like to know what
is really going on here.

376
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,856
I know you would,

377
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,796
but we are done.

378
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,032
How did you lose your virginity?

379
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,792
I was 24 years old.

380
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,075
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

381
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,867
She was considerably
older than I,

382
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,136
and much, much more experienced.

383
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,468
But...

384
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,605
Fuck!

385
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,678
You've managed to
dose me, haven't you?

386
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,642
In my tea. You little shit.

387
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,920
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

388
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,734
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

389
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,057
you would have done so
already, but you haven't.

390
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:56,922
Eliza,

391
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,863
who is she?

392
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:02,829
Eliza's real name
is Jane Chatwin.

393
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,602
Oh.

394
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,617
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

395
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,641
Uh...

396
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,746
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

397
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,715
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book,

398
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,774
<i>The Girl Who Told Time?</i>

399
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,051
Uh, yeah, Ember gave
her a watch and a locket.

400
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,286
Ember gave her the
ability to fuck with time,

401
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,587
on a cosmic scale,

402
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,619
and Jane used it to
create a time loop.

403
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,459
When she'd fail
to stop The Beast,

404
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,727
she'd restart the loop.

405
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,093
A time loop.

406
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,459
Okay.

407
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,671
Uh...

408
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,671
So, what do we have
to do with The Beast?

409
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,211
You just keep getting involved.

410
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,109
I don't keep doing anything.

411
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,647
Can you imagine, Quentin,

412
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,945
how many times we've had this

413
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,609
exact conversation?

414
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,547
You've managed
to slip truth serum

415
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,556
to me 27 times,

416
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,956
27 ways, and
I'm quite sick of it.

417
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,857
So, what, this is just some giant,
blood-soaked <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

418
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,496
You always bring
up that fucking movie.

419
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,061
I still haven't seen it.

420
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,965
(LAUGHS) Now
it's a point of pride.

421
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,264
Answer my question.

422
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,532
In each loop,

423
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,570
Jane alters something

424
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,234
to see if it'll change
the outcome.

425
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,312
The sigil that
appeared on your hand,

426
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,741
brought you to Alice.

427
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,115
That was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

428
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,278
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

429
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,297
and we all know how
well that particular

430
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,187
great idea worked out, don't we?

431
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,550
So, has anything
actually helped?

432
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,357
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

433
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,065
How many times
have I died? Thirty-nine.

434
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,901
Thirty-nine times.

435
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,436
And if you die a 40th,

436
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,935
at least I won't
have to hear you

437
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,633
ask me this question ever again.

438
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,440
Jane's dead, Quentin.

439
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,770
The loop's done.

440
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,577
There's no one to reset it.

441
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,641
So, this is it?

442
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,412
This isn't my problem.

443
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,848
My problem is that
I'm strong enough

444
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,617
to discern a time loop,

445
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,787
but not strong
enough to change it.

446
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,158
We better hope and pray

447
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,559
that Jane altered the
right thing this time around.

448
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,692
Anything else, Quentin?

449
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,031
What's different this time?

450
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,803
Please, no books on the floor.

451
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:27,970
I love this one.

452
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,407
Photos from places
I can't imagine.

453
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,347
I know you hate it now,

454
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,116
but Travelers wrote
our most precious books.

455
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,256
The library is what
it is because of them.

456
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,891
You make it sound
so simple and fun.

457
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,157
No.

458
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,760
But it is valuable.

459
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,666
And in my observation,

460
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,432
master Travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

461
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,269
I was looking for
any technical info

462
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,904
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but...

463
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,744
The books you seek
are in another branch.

464
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,345
Of course they are.

465
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,654
Look, could you... Could
you expedite that shit?

466
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,382
I don't have much
time, and I really

467
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,459
need to know how to
take people with me.

468
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,925
I'll put in a request.

469
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,920
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

470
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,129
Probably because Franz
Kafka wrote <i>The Trial</i>

471
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
after spending a
week in the library.

472
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,932
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

473
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,709
you will get a handle on it.

474
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,838
I promise.

475
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,707
If?

476
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,577
Say that in my book?

477
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,117
No spoilers.

478
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,229
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

479
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,148
Hi.

480
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,291
I was at Brakebills?
You were supposed to be.

481
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,826
Or you were, like, 39 times.

482
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,129
You were the thing they changed.

483
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,408
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

484
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,458
and you would
get stronger, and...

485
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,593
So, I was right.

486
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,795
The whole time, I was right.

487
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,267
I don't know what
to say, Jules. I...

488
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,920
I should have
believed you, Jules.

489
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,708
I should have known, and I'm...

490
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,514
Um...

491
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,379
Look, that doesn't make
up for what I did to you,

492
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,385
which was stupid,

493
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,126
and vindictive,

494
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,228
and really dangerous.

495
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,064
I'm so sorry, Q.

496
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,602
Thank you.

497
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,306
So, how do we
fix it? I don't know.

498
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,589
I just know that I'm
gonna get killed soon,

499
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,548
and I don't really want to die

500
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,083
being mad at my oldest friend.

501
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,281
I really fucking missed you.

502
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,280
Yeah, me, too, actually.

503
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,727
You smell the same. (CHUCKLES)

504
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,398
Okay, all right.

505
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,736
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

506
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,637
So... (SIGHS)

507
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,144
Big conspiracy.

508
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,473
Wheels within wheels.

509
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,645
Julia doesn't go
to Brakebills, and?

510
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,145
You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

511
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,488
It's because there is bigger,

512
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,047
better magic in the world.

513
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,265
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

514
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,158
I can barely believe it.

515
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,464
What?

516
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,801
Some friends and I got
into some pretty eclectic shit.

517
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,396
You and Kady?

518
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,165
Where is she?

519
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,200
On a mission.

520
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,070
They all are.

521
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,706
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

522
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,074
From?

523
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,442
A goddess.

524
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,551
We summoned, and she came.

525
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,585
You mean, um, here?

526
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,621
To your loft?

527
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,628
You don't believe me.
Shit, I wouldn't, either.

528
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,792
That is why she gave me proof.

529
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,565
Is that milk? Yeah.

530
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,008
Cool,

531
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,441
useless, kind of gross.

532
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,141
But look under the hood.

533
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:02,980
Oh, my God.

534
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,690
Who did this magic?

535
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,694
I told you. She did.

536
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,853
I mean, it was crazy.

537
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,024
It was like being on a
massive dose of ecstasy.

538
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,761
When she touched me,

539
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,166
it was like my psyche
was defragging.

540
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,535
I mean, she... She
touched all of us.

541
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,336
She granted every petition.

542
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,167
She cured Menolly's
breast cancer,

543
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,214
she sent Richard to
where he wanted to go.

544
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,073
I watched this.

545
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,050
I thought magic
couldn't cure cancer.

546
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,779
Not regular magic.

547
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,148
Look, I can't lie, okay?

548
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,658
It was shitty going
for a while there,

549
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:40,951
not being in Brakebills,

550
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,757
but I can't sit here now,

551
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,627
and think it was
anything but fate.

552
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,000
Right, or just the right
random combination.

553
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,502
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

554
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,333
I need your help.

555
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,140
I don't know how to
get back, and, um...

556
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,958
My friends, we got separated,

557
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,060
and I just... I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

558
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,746
and I have to find a way...

559
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,346
Let me get this straight.

560
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,755
You want me to come
to Fillory with you?

561
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,855
Yeah.

562
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:19,923
Come here.

563
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,264
QUENTIN: Holy
shit. This is our table.

564
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,984
JULIA: Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

565
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,439
QUENTIN: We kind of have, huh?

566
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,803
Our Lady gave me a mission to...

567
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,039
I sound like a nut-job.

568
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,005
Kind of. (CHUCKLES)

569
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,040
What's the mission?

570
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,816
She said it was my destiny

571
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,150
to basically find

572
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,588
a whole new kind of magic.

573
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,183
You know, she said
it was something

574
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,489
that couldn't be given.

575
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,893
It had to be found.

576
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,224
So, we have to find it.

577
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,102
And I bet you it's here.

578
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,668
So, I guess we're
off to see the Wizard.

579
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,306
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

580
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,867
QUENTIN: Start of
the London Blitz, 1940,

581
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,277
and then their mom dies, 1941.

582
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,781
Q, where are you
going with this?

583
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,784
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

584
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,843
but we do know when they open...

585
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,464
Every time the Chatwins go.

586
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,166
So, if we could just
find a way to get there,

587
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,455
then we could follow them in.

588
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,922
Look, all I know is time magic

589
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,158
is apparently a thing,

590
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,243
a thing that's been dicking
with us for the past 39 lifetimes.

591
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,964
So, I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

592
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,069
Wait, but that would put
us in past Fillory, right?

593
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,034
Fillory is magic.

594
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,234
Remember, Jane
falls in that swamp,

595
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,403
and then she comes
out 20 years later.

596
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,773
She strikes a deal with the
Watcher Woman to send her back.

597
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,951
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

598
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,581
I have an idea,

599
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,349
something Richard told me,

600
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,416
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

601
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,653
Brakebills.

602
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,119
Okay.

603
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,907
Uh, you just have to
be a registered student

604
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,524
in order to get
through the wards.

605
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,162
Alumni key.

606
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,762
Richard gave it to me.

607
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,304
MARGO: This place is impossible.

608
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,104
How does anyone find anything?

609
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,536
There's a whole
wing on cat paintings.

610
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,244
What have you got? Anything?

611
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,382
The Book of Mike McCormick.

612
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,280
Novella, really.

613
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,584
He was actually a
Republican. Can you believe it?

614
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,287
But the worst part?

615
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,321
His life was happy.

616
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,722
Eliot, he's gone.

617
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,629
Why are you torturing yourself?

618
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,857
Because he's gone
and it's my fault.

619
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,735
And of all the
people in the world

620
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,705
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

621
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,436
What are you doing?

622
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,602
Putting the past behind me.

623
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,111
(GASPS) No, stop!

624
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,778
Look, he's had a
really bad week.

625
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,145
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

626
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,413
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library, forever.

627
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,349
It's one book.

628
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,551
No, it's a life.

629
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,456
They're irreplaceable.

630
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,058
No, wait!

631
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,197
What did you do?

632
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,323
PENNY: Let's go.

633
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,835
QUENTIN: "Bridge
to ancient Rome."

634
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,035
"Bridge to the
Cretaceous Period."

635
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,602
Oh, hey, here's one. Uh...

636
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,781
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

637
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,480
(CHUCKLES)
Voyage of the <i>Titanic?</i>

638
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,376
Oh. Fun.

639
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,092
So, we're pretty sure
these things only go

640
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,755
to one specific
point in time and...

641
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,342
Once you lock a
date in, you're locked.

642
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,425
I mean, they use some tiny piece

643
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,859
of an incredibly rare element.

644
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,220
All got used up by the '70s.

645
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,956
Wait a minute.
Wait. Here's a thesis.

646
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,531
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

647
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,897
"Operation Die
Fuehrer." (SCOFFS)

648
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,817
Guess no one
told them Hitler was

649
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,275
a pretty serious
battle Magician.

650
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,402
Yeah.

651
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,809
Yep, and Hitler killed them.

652
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,613
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

653
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,412
Uh, it's April 19th, 1942.

654
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,813
April 19th.

655
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:03,948
Yeah.

656
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,415
You remember the, uh...
Yeah, "The Flying Forest"?

657
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,824
Yeah, uh, Jane's
going into town.

658
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,626
She's looking for a
present for Martin.

659
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,325
April 21st, 1942.

660
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,662
Two days after this time bridge.

661
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:20,915
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

662
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,019
I never thought I'd say
it, but thank God for Hitler.

663
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,242
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

664
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:28,913
Yeah.

665
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,646
Earth fountain's blocked off.

666
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,978
I told you it would be.

667
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,513
ELIOT: It was worth a shot.

668
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,920
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

669
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,434
I don't know. How about
not get us kicked out

670
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,778
of the library in
the first place?

671
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,359
PENNY: All right,
let's keep moving.

672
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,720
Hey. Not one more step.

673
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,437
We're highly trained
Earth Magicians.

674
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,098
Hold up. Hold up. You
guys are from Brakebills?

675
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,263
Dude, Josh
Hoberman, class of '16.

676
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,952
Come with me if
you want to live.

677
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,547
I've always wanted to
say that. (CHUCKLES)

678
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,643
But seriously, um, we should go.

679
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,381
Welcome to <i>Chez</i> Hoberman.

680
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,490
You're welcome to whatever.

681
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,087
Just don't eat the carrots.

682
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,290
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

683
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,300
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

684
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,826
Holy shit.

685
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,965
This tastes like pizza.

686
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,503
Yeah, I know, right?

687
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,086
How long have you
been down here?

688
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,369
A few weeks.

689
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,769
Just been camped out,

690
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,454
waiting to see if
anyone else will show up.

691
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,379
Anyone else? From my class.

692
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,879
Look, don't freak,

693
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,428
but back at Brakebills, nobody
knows what happened to you guys.

694
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,047
And it's sort of been two years.

695
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,554
Oh, shit. Right, the
whole time thing.

696
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,463
Victoria warned me about
that. PENNY: Victoria?

697
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,959
You know her?

698
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,794
She's the only reason I'm alive.

699
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,708
Look, are you gonna
tell us what the fuck

700
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,166
happened to your class, or what?

701
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,197
Where'd you guys go? To Fillory.

702
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:58,829
For spring break.

703
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,939
V's amazing.

704
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,133
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

705
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,803
<i>Teachers put this
tattoo on her to stop her.</i>

706
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,142
She just cut it off herself.

707
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,307
Joshy. What?

708
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,702
You're not gonna
believe it. What?

709
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,476
I did it. I found Fillory.

710
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,210
What? I found Fillory!

711
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,120
Oh, my God! We're
going to Fillory!

712
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,213
We're going to Fillory?

713
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,491
<i>So, we decided to plan a trip.</i>

714
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,494
<i>You know, party, smoke
out with the centaurs,</i>

715
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,462
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

716
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,294
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first-year class,</i>

717
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,061
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

718
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,830
<i>Luckily, V was so good, she
was able to take them all with.</i>

719
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,496
<i>It was magical.</i> (CHUCKLES)

720
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,199
<i>I mean, more magical
than Brakebills,</i>

721
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,507
<i>like going from black
and white to color.</i>

722
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:44,342
V and I had a
threesome with a naiad.

723
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,716
This guy Donnie, he had
sex with a talking horse.

724
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,187
I mean, it's not
exactly taboo in Fillory,

725
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,615
since the animals
can give consent,

726
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,256
but we were all still
a bit squicked out.

727
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,089
We get it. You
fucked some animals.

728
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,156
How'd you end up here?

729
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,997
Got roped into this quest.

730
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,568
Ended up being
a trap for Victoria.

731
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,034
This dude, Mothra,
I've been calling him...

732
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,335
Yeah, we know that clown.

733
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,802
It was a bloodbath.

734
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,768
V zapped me here, and
then she went back in.

735
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,111
Told me to stay put, so
I have just been waiting.

736
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,318
V should have been here by now.

737
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,288
He caught her.

738
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:26,851
But she's still alive.

739
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,751
How do you know
that? I'm like her.

740
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,454
It's why I'm here.

741
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,494
We can all go, rescue Victoria.

742
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,590
You can take us.

743
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,529
Haven't exactly cracked

744
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,269
the whole ride-along, yet.

745
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,872
Okay, forget traveling.

746
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,435
Uh, we'll just take a fountain.

747
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,543
Except we don't know
where the Fillory fountain is.

748
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,682
That's easy.

749
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,494
It's three squares
up, one square left.

750
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,454
The problem is all the
battle magic dick buckets

751
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,921
waiting to vaporize us.

752
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,114
Discuss.

753
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,330
It's in the closet.

754
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,427
El and Margo made a door
to their favorite pub in London.

755
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,464
JULIA: They look like fun.

756
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,717
Look, you were
supposed to be here.

757
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,085
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

758
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,634
No, you know, I
think Jane was right.

759
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,689
Had I been here living it up,

760
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:22,857
I would have never felt the need

761
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,611
to figure out what
magic is actually for.

762
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,809
Okay, so what's
magic actually for, then?

763
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,013
For fixing things, dummy.

764
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:33,850
Trust me.

765
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,518
I, uh, made a lot of mistakes

766
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,687
before I figured that one out.

767
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,997
Yeah, everything I've been
able to fix doesn't matter,

768
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,264
just minor mendings
and bullshit.

769
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,570
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

770
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,265
everyone would do it.

771
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,467
Come on.

772
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,171
PENNY: Alice.

773
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,610
Get some sleep. (SIGHS)

774
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,417
I know.

775
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,086
I might as well.

776
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,583
I'll never figure this out.

777
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,049
Trying to think of how to get
us all to the Fillory fountain

778
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,389
without getting us killed.

779
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,559
Need a hand?

780
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,665
Look, Penny,

781
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,639
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea, but...

782
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,198
Stop.

783
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,942
It was fun, okay?

784
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,379
You're one of the few
people I actually respect.

785
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,510
Uh, yeah, you're right, right.

786
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,915
I'm just making this weird, huh?

787
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,616
Eh, it's weird.

788
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,118
We're weird. So, what?

789
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,455
We're friends, right?

790
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,595
I just keep thinking
about Quentin.

791
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,598
Look, I know.

792
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,613
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

793
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,641
if, out of all of us,

794
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,701
he was the one who
didn't get to see Fillory.

795
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,642
And then I remember
that I hate him.

796
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,248
Fuck, why am I such an idiot?

797
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,545
Okay.

798
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,545
Quentin is irrelevant.

799
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,420
Just another excuse for
that thing you always do.

800
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,320
What thing? "I
should just give up.

801
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,395
"I'll never figure it out."

802
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,890
Shit got real.

803
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,360
If you're gonna
drop that bullshit,

804
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,593
now's the time.

805
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,331
ALICE: <i>Phosphoromancy.</i>

806
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,069
I can bend light around us, all
of us, the whole group, I think,

807
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,000
make us invisible.

808
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,644
It'll be difficult with the
two suns but not impossible.

809
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,589
We'll have to move in
a pretty tight formation.

810
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,613
When should we leave?

811
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,842
As soon as possible.

812
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,475
The suns are just
about in position.

813
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,152
It has begun!

814
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,053
Sorry.

815
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,680
Penny, Eliot, you're both tall,

816
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,134
so, you'll have to duck down
and stay close to me, okay?

817
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,558
Or they'll see you. Got it.

818
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,755
We got it, right?

819
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,763
Mmm-hmm.

820
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,830
Eliot, are you coming?

821
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,429
Right behind you, Bambi.

822
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,440
Let's do this.

823
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,278
Okay.

824
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,082

Holy shit. (SIRENS BLARING)

827
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,556
Is that an air raid siren?

828
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,659
Okay.

829
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,368
1942.

830
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,170
We need to get out of here.

831
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,668
Yeah.

832
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,640
(WHISPERS) Go to the right.

833
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,457
(ECHOING) Is
everything all right, Eliot?

834
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,626
Everything's amazing.

835
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,464
Go left. Go left.

836
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,513
(GUNSHOT)

837
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,814
Yeah, I brought a gun.

838
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,251
"Thanks, Margo."

839
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,723
You're welcome.
Why didn't you move?

840
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,059
Acid carrots.

841
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,400
Margo, you saved my actual life.

842
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,128
Hooray, you live to
drink another day.

843
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,682
ALICE: Shit, guys, they see us.

844
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,368
Shit! Go! Go!

Oh, my God. (GASPS)

848
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,474
She looks so young.

849
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,279
Yeah, she's got no
idea what's coming.

850
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,778
Hey.

851
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,946
That's gotta be it, right?

852
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,765
Across the street,
the door to Fillory?

853
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,984
QUENTIN: Yeah.

854
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,422
Here she comes.

00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,502

Why, yes, Martin, I think I am.

Oh, my God.

Q.

Look.
