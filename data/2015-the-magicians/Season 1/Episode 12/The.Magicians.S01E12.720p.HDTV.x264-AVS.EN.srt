Julia doesn't go to Brakebills, and?

553
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:52,008
You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

554
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:56,295
It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

555
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,965
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

556
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,634
I can barely believe it.

557
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:05,471
Wha--what?

558
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,391
Some friends and I got into
some pretty eclectic shit.

559
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,192
You and Kady?

560
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,228
Where is she?

561
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,146
On a mission.

562
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,983
They all are.

563
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:19,151
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

564
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,820
From?

565
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,739
A goddess.

566
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,543
We summoned, and she came.

567
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:29,412
You mean, um, here?

568
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,214
To your loft?

569
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,717
You don't believe me.
Shit, I wouldn't either.

570
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:38,004
That is why she gave me proof.

571
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,511
Is that milk?

572
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,512
Yeah.

573
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,847
Cool,

574
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:48,898
useless,

575
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,232
kind of gross.

576
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:53,853
But look under the hood.

577
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,693
Oh, my God.

578
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,411
Who did this magic?

579
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,531
I told you.
She did.

580
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,366
I mean, it was crazy.

581
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:11,253
It was like being
on a massive dose of ecstasy.

582
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:12,872
When she touched me,

583
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,124
it was like my psyche was defragging.

584
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,293
I mean, she--
she touched all of us.

585
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,545
She granted every petition.

586
00:27:19,547 --> 00:27:21,797
She cured Menolly's breast cancer;

587
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,301
she sent Richard
to where he wanted to go.

588
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,886
I watched this.

589
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:28,721
I thought magic couldn't cure cancer.

590
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,556
Not regular magic.

591
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,975
Look, I can't lie, okay?

592
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:36,228
It was shitty going
for a while there,

593
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,613
not being in Brakebills,

594
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,066
but I can't sit here now

595
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,119
and think it was anything but fate.

596
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:46,739
Right, or just the right
random combination.

597
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,158
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

598
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:55,081
I need your help.

599
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,916
I don't know how to get back,

600
00:27:56,918 --> 00:28:00,419
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

601
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,588
and I just--I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

602
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,757
and I have to find
a way, um--

603
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,092
Let me get this straight.

604
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:10,596
You want me to come
to Fillory with you.

605
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,598
Uh, yeah.

606
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,154
Come here.

607
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:20,990
Holy shit.
This is our table.

608
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:23,442
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

609
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,161
We kind of have, huh?

610
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:27,947
Our Lady gave me
a mission to--

611
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:30,116
I sound like a nutjob.

612
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,168
- Kind of.
- [chuckles]

613
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:35,287
What's the mission?

614
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,290
She said it was my destiny

615
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,710
to basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

616
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,879
You know, she said it was something

617
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,048
that couldn't be given.

618
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,384
It had to be found.

619
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:52,555
So we have to find it.

620
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,356
And I bet you it's here.

621
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:57,393
So I guess we're off
to see the Wizard.

622
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,062
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

623
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,531
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,

624
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:04,817
and then their mom dies, 1941.

625
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,485
Q, where are you going with this?

626
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:09,371
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

627
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,041
but we do know
when they open--

628
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,375
every time the Chatwins go.

629
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:14,994
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

630
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,163
then we could follow 'em in.

631
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:18,714
Uh...

632
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:22,668
Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

633
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,837
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

634
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,673
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

635
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:30,559
Wait, but that would put us
in past Fillory, right?

636
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:32,728
Fillory is magic.

637
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:35,397
Remember, Jane falls in that swamp,

638
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,183
and then she comes out
20 years later.

639
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,351
She strikes a deal
with the Watcherwoman

640
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:41,270
to send her back.

641
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:45,741
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

642
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:47,409
I have an idea,

643
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,028
something Richard told me,

644
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,697
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

645
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,449
Brakebills.

646
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,783
Okay.

647
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,535
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

648
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,871
in order to get through the wards.

649
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,040
Alumni key.

650
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,592
Richard gave it to me.

651
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:06,095
This place is impossible.

652
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,880
How does anyone find anything?

653
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:10,466
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

654
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,135
What have you got?
Anything?

655
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,054
"The Book of
Mike McCormick."

656
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,056
Novella, really.

657
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,228
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

658
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,063
But the worst part?

659
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:26,115
His life was happy.

660
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,566
Eliot, he's gone.

661
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:29,318
Why are you torturing yourself?

662
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,738
Because he's gone and it's my fault.

663
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,456
And of all the people in the world

664
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:37,409
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

665
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,914
- What are you doing?
- Putting the past behind me.

666
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,250
[gasps] No, stop!

667
00:30:44,252 --> 00:30:45,584
Look, he's had a really bad week.

668
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:47,169
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

669
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,172
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

670
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,258
It's one book.

671
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,310
No, it's a life.

672
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,095
They're irreplaceable.

673
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:58,230
No, wait!

674
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,935
What did you do?

675
00:31:02,937 --> 00:31:05,938
Let's go.

676
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,610
<i>"Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

677
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:15,531
"Bridge to
the Cretaceous period."

678
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,116
Oh, hey, here's one.

679
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,618
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

680
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,121
[laughs]
Voyage of the "Titanic."

681
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,839
Oh, fun.

682
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,474
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

683
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,626
to one specific
point in time and--

684
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,461
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

685
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:32,631
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

686
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,883
All got used up by the '70s.

687
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,385
Wait a minute.

688
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,470
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

689
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:42,141
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

690
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,311
"Operation Die Fuehrer."
[scoffs]

691
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,478
Guess no one told 'em Hitler was

692
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,980
a pretty serious battle Magician?

693
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,481
Yeah.

694
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,567
Uh, yep, and Hitler killed them.

695
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,068
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

696
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,822
Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

697
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:59,491
April 19th.

698
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,327
Yeah.

699
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,247
You remember the, uh--
yeah, "The Flying Forest."

700
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,583
Yeah, uh, Jane's going into town.

701
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,419
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

702
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:14,173
April 21, 1942.

703
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,175
Two days after this time bridge.

704
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,060
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

705
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:20,346
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

706
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:24,400
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

707
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:25,901
Yeah.

708
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,439
Earth fountain's blocked off.

709
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,690
I told you it would be.

710
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:32,908
It was worth a shot.

711
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:34,610
I mean, what else are we gonna do?

712
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,195
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

713
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,746
of the library in the first place?

714
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:39,915
All right, let's keep moving.

715
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:42,939
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

716
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:44,691
We're highly trained Earth magicians.

717
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,160
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from Brakebills?

718
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:50,113
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

719
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:52,282
Come with me if you want to live.

720
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,284
I've always wanted to say that.

721
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,619
[chuckles]

722
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,840
But seriously, um, we should go.

723
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,926
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

724
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,272
Welcome to ***.

725
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:11,015
You're welcome to whatever.

726
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,600
Just don't eat the carrots.

727
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,770
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

728
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:18,940
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

729
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:20,675
Holy shit.

730
