00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,271
no food, drinks,
or any other intoxicants

363
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,397
are allowed in
the library at any time.

364
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,599
That includes
emotion bottles.

365
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,873
Damage always ensues.

366
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,510
(GLASS SHATTERING)

367
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,350
(ALL INHALE AND GROAN)

368
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,471
You understand, of course.

369
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,552
(ALL GROANING AND MOANING)

370
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,873
I planned my whole
outfit around that bottle!

371
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,233
Could you get
to the point, Quentin?

372
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,630
I have a trustees
meeting.

373
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,075
You know something
about what's been
happening here.

374
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,074
The Beast, Eliza.

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,469
I would like to
know what is really
going on here.

376
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,834
I know you would,

377
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,759
but we are done.

378
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,994
How did you lose
your virginity?

379
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,759
I was 24 years old.

380
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,999
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

381
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,832
She was considerably
older than I,

382
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,072
and much, much
more experienced.

383
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,435
But...

384
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,595
Fuck!

385
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,632
You've managed to
dose me, haven't you?

386
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,589
In my tea.
You little shit.

387
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,875
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

388
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,639
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

389
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,030
you would have
done so already,
but you haven't.

390
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,909
Eliza,

391
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,830
who is she?

392
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,795
Eliza's real name
is Jane Chatwin.

393
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,550
Oh.

394
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,919
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,990
Uh...

396
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,717
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

397
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,679
Do you remember
the gift that Jane
was given in the book,

398
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,751
<i>The Girl Who Told Time?</i>

399
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,991
Uh, yeah, Ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

400
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,236
Ember gave her
the ability to
fuck with time,

401
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,549
on a cosmic scale,

402
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,589
and Jane used it to
create a time loop.

403
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,396
When she'd fail
to stop The Beast,

404
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,675
she'd restart the loop.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,070
A time loop.

406
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,435
Okay-

407
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,630
Uh...

408
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,594
So, what do we have
to do with The Beast?

409
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,154
You just keep
getting involved.

410
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,072
I don't keep
doing anything.

411
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,639
Can you imagine,
Quentin,

412
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,912
how many times
we've had this

413
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,593
exact conversation?

414
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,518
You've managed
to slip truth serum

415
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,511
to me 27 times,

416
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,910
27 ways, and I'm
quite sick of it.

417
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,839
So, what, this is
just some giant,
blood-soaked Groundhog <i>Day?</i>

418
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,475
You always bring up
that fucking movie.

419
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,989
I still haven't seen it.

420
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,910
(LAUGHS) Now it's
a point of pride.

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,229
Answer my question.

422
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,515
In each loop,

423
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,510
Jane alters something

424
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,193
to see if it'll
change the outcome.

425
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,271
The sigil that
appeared on your hand,

426
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,675
brought you to Alice.

427
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,077
That was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

428
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,231
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

429
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,199
and we all know how
well that particular

430
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,157
great idea worked
out, don't we?

431
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,513
So, has anything
actually helped?

432
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,318
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

433
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,037
How many times have I died?
Thirty-nine.

434
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,831
Thirty-nine times.

435
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,399
And if you die a 40th,

436
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,874
at least I won't
have to hear you

437
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,598
ask me this
question ever again.

438
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,390
Jane's dead, Quentin.

439
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,710
The loop's done.

440
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,560
There's no one
to reset it.

441
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,595
So, this is it?

442
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,398
This isn't my problem.

443
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,833
My problem is that
I'm strong enough

444
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,558
to discern a time loop,

445
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,758
but not strong
enough to change it.

446
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,110
We better hope and pray

447
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,510
that Jane altered
the right thing this
time around.

448
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,674
Anything else, Quentin?

449
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,994
What's different this time?

450
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,752
Please, no books
on the floor.

451
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,910
I love this one.

452
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,391
Photos from places
I can't imagine.

453
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,315
I know you hate it now,

454
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,116
but Travelers wrote
our most precious books.

455
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,236
The library is what
it is because of them.

456
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,872
You make it sound
so simple and fun.

457
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,110
No.

458
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,749
But it is valuable.

459
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
And in my observation,

460
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,394
master Travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

461
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,200
I was looking for
any technical info

462
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,874
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but...

463
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,712
The books you seek
are in another branch.

464
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,309
Of course they are.

465
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,635
Look, could you...
Could you expedite
that shit?

466
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,359
I don't have much
time, and I really

467
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,431
need to know how to
take people with me.

468
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,872
I'll put in a request.

469
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,879
Why am I not
feeling optimistic?

470
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,072
Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote
The Trial

471
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,720
after spending
a week in the library.

472
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,919
But, Penny, if you
can survive long enough,

473
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,677
you will get
a handle on it.

474
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,829
I promise.

475
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,670
If?

476
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,555
Say that in my book?

477
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,078
No spoilers.

478
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,194
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

479
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,114
Hi.

480
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,237
I was at Brakebills?
You were supposed to be.

481
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,789
Or you were,
like, 39 times.

482
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,079
You were the thing
they changed.

483
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,278
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

484
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,437
and you would get
stronger, and...

485
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,555
So, I was right.

486
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,753
The whole time,
I was right.

487
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,238
I don't know what
to say, Jules. I...

488
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,795
I should have
believed you, Jules.

489
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,678
I should have known,
and I'm...

490
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,470
Um...

491
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,355
Look, that doesn't
make up for what
I did to you,

492
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,359
which was stupid,

493
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,079
and vindictive,

494
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,194
and really dangerous.

495
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,034
I'm so sorry, Q.

496
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,590
Thank you.

497
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,238
So, how do we fix it?
I don't know.

498
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,514
I just know that I'm
gonna get killed soon,

499
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,511
and I don't really
want to die

500
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,034
being mad at
my oldest friend.

501
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,275
I really fucking
missed you.

502
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,279
Yeah, me, too,
actually.

503
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,713
You smell the same.
(CHUCKLES)

504
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,359
Okay, all right.

505
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,714
Uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

506
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,633
So...
(SIGHS)

507
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,119
Big conspiracy.

508
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,475
Wheels within wheels.

509
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,638
Julia doesn't go
to Brakebills, and?

510
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,114
You're taking
this a lot better
than I would have.

511
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,439
It's because
there is bigger,

512
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,999
better magic
in the world.

513
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,076
I mean, you would
not believe some of
the shit I've seen.

514
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,152
I can barely believe it.

515
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,439
What?

516
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,759
Some friends and
I got into some pretty
eclectic shit.

517
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,355
You and Kady?

518
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,150
Where is she?

519
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,155
On a mission.

520
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,035
They all are.

521
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,677
They got pretty
strict marching
orders.

522
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,035
From?

523
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,390
A goddess.

524
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,516
We summoned,
and she came.

525
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,555
You mean, um, here?

526
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,598
To your loft?

527
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,591
You don't believe me.
Shit, lwou
dn't, either.

528
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,760
That is why
she gave me proof.

529
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,519
Yeah.
ls that milk?

530
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,990
Cool,

531
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,396
useless, kind of gross.

532
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,120
But look under the hood.

533
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,950
Oh, my God.

534
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,670
Who did this magic?

535
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,669
I told you. She did.

536
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,793
I mean, it was crazy.

537
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,998
It was like being
on a massive dose
of ecstasy.

538
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,709
When she touched me,

539
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,112
it was like my
psyche was defragging.

540
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,472
I mean, she...
She touched all of us.

541
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,312
She granted every petition.

542
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,151
She cured Meno

y's
breast cancer,

543
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,198
she sent Richard to
where he wanted to go.

544
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,070
I watched this.

545
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,994
I thought magic
couldn't cure cancer.

546
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,718
Not regular magic.

547
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,115
Look, I can't lie, okay?

548
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,591
It was shitty going
for a while there,

549
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,915
not being in Brakebills,

550
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,719
but I can't sit
here now,

551
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,598
and think it was
anything but fate.

552
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,959
Right, or just
the right random
combination.

553
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,469
Okay, suit yourself,
nihilist.

554
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,310
I need your help.

555
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,078
I don't know how
to get back, and, um...

556
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,830
My friends, we got separated,

557
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,957
and ljust...
I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own,

558
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,718
and I have to find a way...

559
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,310
Let me get this
straight.

560
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,711
You want me to come
to Fillory with you?

561
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,795
Yeah.

562
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,910
Come here.

563
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,239
QUENTIN: Holy shit.
This is our table.

564
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,910
JULIA: Kind of been
planning this trip
since we were nine.

565
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,235
QUENTIN; We kind Of have, huh?

566
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,793
Our Lady gave me
a mission to...

567
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,995
I sound like a nut-job.

568
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,950
Kind of.
(CHUCKLES)

569
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,995
What's the mission?

570
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,753
She said it was
my destiny

571
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,069
to basically find

572
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,554
a whole new
kind of magic.

573
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,154
You know, she said
it was something

574
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,435
that couldn't be given.

575
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,840
It had to be found.

576
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,195
So, we have to find it.

577
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,079
And I bet you
it's here.

578
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,639
So, I guess we're
off to see the Wizard.

579
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,196
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

580
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,831
QUENTIN: Start of
the London Blitz, 1940,

581
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,230
and then their
mom dies, 1941.

582
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,754
Q, where are you
going with this?

583
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,753
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

584
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,831
but we do know
when they open...

585
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,390
Every time the Chatwins go.

586
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,073
So, if we could just
find a way to get there,

587
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,436
then we could
follow them in.

588
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,872
Look, all I know is
time magic

589
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,075
is apparently a thing,

590
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,157
a thing that's been
clicking with us for
the past 39 lifetimes.

591
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,914
So, I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

592
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,037
Wait, but that would
put us in past Fillory,
right?

593
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,033
Fillory is magic.

594
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,191
Remember, Jane falls
in that swamp,

595
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,351
and then she comes
out 20 years later.

596
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,752
She strikes a deal
with the Watcher Woman
to send her back.

597
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,913
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

598
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,515
I have an idea,

599
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,275
something Richard told me,

600
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,351
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

601
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,630
Brakebills.

602
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,075
Okay-

603
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,798
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

604
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,518
in order to get
through the wards.

605
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,115
Alumni key.

606
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,715
Richard gave it to me.

607
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,280
MARGO: This place
is impossible.

608
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,033
How does anyone
find anything?

609
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,511
There's a whole
wing on cat paintings.

610
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,232
What have you got?
Anything?

611
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,351
The Book of
Mike McCormick.

612
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,235
Novella, really.

613
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,560
He was actually
a Republican. Can
you believe it?

614
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,235
But the worst part?

615
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,273
His life was happy.

616
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,715
Eliot, he's gone.

617
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,594
Why are you
torturing yourself?

618
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,832
Because he's gone
and it's my fault.

619
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,674
And of all the people
in the world

620
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,673
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

621
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,389
What are you doing?

622
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,550
Putting the past
behind me.

623
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,074
(GASPS) No, stop!

624
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,714
Look, he's had
a really bad week.

625
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,074
We'll pay the fine,
whatever.

626
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,397
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library, forever.

627
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,309
It's one book.

628
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,512
No, it's a life.

629
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,434
They're irreplaceable.

630
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,039
No, wait!

631
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,150
What did you do?

632
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,270
PENNY: Let's go.

633
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,792
QUENTIN:
"Bridge to ancient Rome."

634
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,998
"Bridge to
the Cretaceous Period."

635
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,593
Oh, hey, here's one.
Uh...

636
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,757
"Southampton,
England, 1912"?

637
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,475
<i>(CHUCKLES)
Voyage of the Titanic?</i>

638
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,359
Oh. Fun.

639
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,033
So, we're pretty sure
these things only go

640
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,713
to one specific
point in time and...

641
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,234
Once you lock
a date in, you're locked.

642
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,394
I mean, they use
some tiny piece

643
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,800
of an incredibly
rare element.

644
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,197
All got used up
bythe'70s.

645
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,957
Wait a minute.
Wait. Here's a thesis.

646
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,479
A bunch of students
wanted to go back
and kill Hitler.

647
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,877
"Operation Die Fuehrer."
(SCOFFS)

648
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,755
Guess no one
told them Hitler was

649
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,239
a pretty serious
battle magician.

650
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,355
Yeah.

651
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,798
Yep, and Hitler
killed them.

652
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,559
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

653
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,358
Uh, it's April 19th, 1942.

654
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,789
April 19th.

655
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,915
Yeah.

656
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,390
You remember the, uh...
Yeah, "The Flying Forest"?

657
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,790
Yeah, uh, Jane's
going into town.

658
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,599
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

659
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,314
April 21st, 1942.

660
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,599
Two days after
this time bridge.

661
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,795
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

662
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,951
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

663
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,195
Yeah, no, that still
sounds bad.

664
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,870
Yeah.

665
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,589
Earth fountain's
blocked off.

666
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,950
I told you it would be.

667
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,430
ELIOT: It was worth a shot.

668
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,874
I mean, what else are
we gonna do?

669
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,314
I don't know.
How about not
get us kicked out

670
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,720
of the library in
the first place?

671
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,955
PENNY: All right,
let's keep moving.

672
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,711
Hey. Not one more step.

673
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,234
We're highly trained
Earth magicians.

674
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,036
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from
Brakebills?

675
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,232
Dude, Josh Hoberman,
class of '16.

676
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,835
Come with me if
you want to live.

677
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,393
I've always
wanted to say that.
(CHUCKLES)

678
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,592
But seriously, um,
we should go.

679
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,356
Welcome to Chez Hoberman.

680
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,440
You're welcome to whatever.

681
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,069
Just don't eat
the carrots.

682
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,240
They're totally
psychedelic for
some reason.

683
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,229
Circumstances in
the Neitherlands
are super weird.

684
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,795
Holy shit.

685
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,915
This tastes like pizza.

686
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,479
Yeah, I know, right?

687
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,989
How long have
you been down here?

688
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,354
A few weeks.

689
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,749
Just been camped out,

690
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,354
waiting to see if
anyone else will show up.

691
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,351
Anyone else?
From my class.

692
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,840
Look, don't freak,

693
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,275
but back at Brakebills,
nobody knows what
happened to you guys.

694
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,036
And it's sort of
been two years.

695
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,515
Oh, shit. Right,
the whole time thing.

696
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,352
Victoria warned me about that.
PENNY: Victoria?

697
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,950
You know her?

698
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,799
She's the only
reason I'm alive.

699
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,595
Look, are you gonna
tell us what the fuck

700
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,114
happened to your
class, or what?

701
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,152
Where'd you guys go?
To Fillory.

702
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,790
For spring break.

703
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,914
V's amazing.

704
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,112
I mean, she literally
blips around the universe,
fearless.

705
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,760
<i>Teachers put this
tattoo on her to stop her.</i>

706
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,069
She just cut it
off herself.

707
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,230
Joshy- What?

708
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,634
You're not gonna believe it.
What?

709
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,480
I did it.
I found Fillory.

710
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,159
What?
I found Fillory!

711
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,032
Oh, my God!
We're going to Fillory!

712
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,195
We're going
to Fillory?

713
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,429
<i>So, we decided
to plan a trip.</i>

714
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,431
<i>You know, party,
smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

715
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,397
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

716
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,233
<i>but word got out to
practically the whole
first-year class,</i>

717
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,038
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

718
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,834
<i>Luckily, V was so good,
she was able to
take them all with.</i>

719
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,469
<i>It was magical. (CHUCKLES)</i>

720
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,154
<i>I mean, more magical
than Brakebills,</i>

721
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,470
<i>like going from
black and white to color.</i>

722
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,274
V and I had a threesome
with a naiad.

723
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,671
This guy Donnie,
he had sex with
a talking horse.

724
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,115
I mean, it's not
exactly taboo in Fillory,

725
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,554
since the animals
can give consent,

726
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,199
but we were all
still a bit squicked out.

727
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,038
We get it. You fucked
some animals.

728
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,109
How'd you end up here?

729
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,954
Got roped
into this quest.

730
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,509
Ended up being
a trap for Victoria.

731
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,994
This dude, Mothra,
I've been calling him...

732
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,309
Yeah, we know
that clown.

733
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,749
It was a bloodbath.

734
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,711
V zapped me here,
and then she went back in.

735
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,071
Told me to stay put,
so I have just
been waiting.

736
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,274
V should have
been here by now.

737
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,230
He caught her.

738
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,835
But she's still alive.

739
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,719
How do you know that?
I'm like her.

740
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,429
It's why I'm here.

741
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,476
We can all go,
rescue Victoria.

742
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,550
You can take us.

743
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,910

...

744
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,469
Haven't exactly
cracked

745
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,234
the whole
ride-along, yet.

746
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,789
Okay, forget
traveling.

747
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,393
Uh, we'll just
take a fountain.

748
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,513
Except we don't know
where the Fillory
fountain is.

749
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,630
That's easy.

750
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,399
It's three squares up,
one square left.

751
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,393
The problem is
all the battle magic
dick buckets

752
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,914
waiting to
vaporize us.

753
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,070
Discuss.

754
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,280
It's in the closet.

755
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,398
El and Margo made
a door to their
favorite pub in London.

756
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,435
JULIA: They look like fun.

757
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,635
Look, you were
supposed to be here.

758
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,994
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

759
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,593
No, you know,
I think Jane was right.

760
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,595
Had I been here
living it up,

761
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,750
I would have
never felt the need

762
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,592
to figure out what
magic is actually for.

763
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,757
Okay, so what's
magic actually for,
then?

764
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,991
For fixing
things, dummy.

765
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,790
Trust me.

766
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,479
I, uh, made
a lot of mistakes

767
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,631
before I figured
that one out.

768
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,953
Yeah, everything
I've been able to
fix doesn't matter,

769
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,237
just minor mendings
and bullshit.

770
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,511
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

771
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,235
everyone would do it.

772
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,435
Come on.

773
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,115
PENNY: Alice.

774
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,594
Get some sleep.
(SIGHS)

775
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,390
I know.

776
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,030
I might as well.

777
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,549

W
never
figure this out.

778
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,989
Trying to think of
how to get us all to
the Fillory fountain

779
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,349
without getting
us killed.

780
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,515
Need a hand?

781
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,640
Look, Penny,

782
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,555
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea, but...

783
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,153
Stop.

784
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,917
It was fun, okay?

785
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,310
You're one of
the few people
I actually respect.

786
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,516
Uh,yeah,
you're right, right.

787
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,873
I'm just making
this weird, huh?

788
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,598
Eh, it's weird.

789
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,072
We're weird.
So, what?

790
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,437
We're friends, right?

791
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,553
ljust keep
thinking about Quentin.

792
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,555
Look, I know.

793
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,473
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

794
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,590
if, out of all of us,

795
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,671
he was the one
who didn't get
to see Fillory.

796
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,598
And then I remember
that I hate him.

797
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,194
Fuck, why am I
such an idiot?

798
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,515
Okay-

799
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,520
Quentin is irrelevant.

800
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,356
Just another
excuse for that thing
you always do.

801
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,278
What thing?
"l should just give up.

802
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,351

never
figure it out."

803

drop that bullshit,

00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,033
I can bend light
around us, all of us,
the whole group, I think,

808
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,950
make us invisible.

809
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,589
It'll be difficult
with the two suns
but not impossible.

810
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,433
We'll have to move
in a pretty tight formation.

811
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,550
When should we leave?

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,789
As soon as possible.
