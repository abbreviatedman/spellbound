1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,089
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,566
What does that mean?

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,571
<i>Jesus, we could not have screwed up
that spell worse,</i>

4
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:06,573
<i>and we can't take it back.</i>

5
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,375
<i>You showed up
with that sigil on your hand.</i>

6
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,976
<i>It appeared when I was
dreaming of Fillory.</i>

7
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,377
- <i>It came from Jane.</i>
- Who are you?

8
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,809
I'm a member of The Order,

9
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,582
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands.

10
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,184
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are, trying to kill me?

11
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,186
They've been thoroughly cursed,
so they can't use the fountains,

12
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,765
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment.

13
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,223
The Beast?

14
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,759
We are the best Magicians we know,
but Menolly is dying.

15
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,431
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

16
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,557
- And you?
- Eight years ago,

17
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:37,536
I was a drug addict,
and I left my son in a hot car.

18
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,010
We're not learning anything new.
Beast always kills us.

19
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,837
There was one time
we didn't all die...

20
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,509
when we went to Fillory.

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,840
<i>Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.</i>

22
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,675
Bottling our emotions...

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,720
<i>When the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.</i>

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,531
<i>Near the bridge, there's a man</i>

25
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:03,728
who has served me
a thousand years.

26
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,570
Bring him three gifts.
He'll show you the way.

27
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,065
Huh.
Not what I expected.

28
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,671
Yeah.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,408
Die, fucker!

30
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,507
Well, that sucked ass.

31
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,615
Julia, Kady!

32
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,118
Finally.
<i>Bienvenidas.</i>

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,421
Are we interrupting or...

34
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,593
Oh, no, no, no.
Just passing the time.

35
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:06,759
So...

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,960
Uh, yeah, um...

37
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,130
We bring forsythia...

38
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,861
Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,696
And honeycomb.

40
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,536
Hmm.

41
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,667
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

42
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,841
<i>Muy bien, chicas.</i>

43
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,372
<i>Muy bien.</i>

44
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,006
Two down.

45
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:27,113
Where's the platinum?

46
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,483
We didn't bring that.

47
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,782
Too bad.
Exit through the gift shop.

48
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,654
But we did bring something
of great and shining worth.

49
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,955
Just say it.

50
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,058
If you're wrong, you're wrong.

51
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:47,126
We brought you our faith.

52
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,134
Ooh.

53
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,366
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,140
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

55
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,708
I like it.

56
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,709
But to be honest,
I'm sensing more skepticism

57
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,647
than faith here.

58
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,416
Look, um, I'm trying.

59
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,189
She's the one
that had the dream, okay?

60
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,256
Hey.

61
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:14,257
Kady, your mother
used your faith,

62
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,261
but she isn't your true mother.

63
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,325
Our Lady feels
you require a miracle.

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,277
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,016
Wha... what ha...

66
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,377
What did he do?

67
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,752
I don't... I don't know.
I've had this tightness

68
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,723
ever since my mom,
but it's gone.

69
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,334
Ah, there it is.

70
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,200
Faith.

71
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
Okay, so...

72
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,370
Let's get to brass.

73
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,739
You're here why?

74
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,540
We seek an audience
with Our Lady Underground.

75
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,643
Yeah, no shit.

76
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,805
Why do you think
you deserve to see her?

77
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,319
- Hmm?
- It's okay.

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,388
Why should she waste
her time with you?

79
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,492
I am privileged,
and I have done some stupid shit,

80
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,895
and I have been through nothing
compared to some of my friends.

81
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,465
So you wish to help them?
Heal them? Is that it?

82
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,767
Yes, that is exactly
what I want to do.

83
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,100
No.

84
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,336
No, no, no.

85
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,676
Magicians...

86
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,378
that's all you ever want,
power, every time.

87
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,017
You know what?

88
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:50,256
For the longest time,
that is all I wanted.

89
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,985
But now I just want to do whatever
the fuck it is I'm supposed to.

90
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:57,162
And if she's around,
if she gives a shit,

91
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,932
I have to believe
she wants her daughters

92
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,269
to show a little ambition.

93
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,670
So you tell her that I am trying

94
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,105
to reach something higher.

95
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,447
<i>Nuestra Se√±ora</i> sits and waits,

96
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,878
and no one asks.

97
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,785
She watches.

98
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,587
She weeps.

99
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,292
But today, she's
grinning like a fool.

100
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,695
Here's the invocation.

101
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,666
May her blessings be with you.

102
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,167
Thank you.

103
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,768
And one more piece
of advice for the chosen.

104
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,257
You can't unring a bell,

105
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,842
so be certain
when you call, Julia.

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,173
Okay.

107
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,374
Look...

108
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,608
All y'all look like
you did a crime last night.

109
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,717
According to all
the probability shit,

110
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,423
we don't have time to wait.

111
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:36,427
One or another super shitty ending
is coming within days

112
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,298
if we don't at least
try to go get the knife.

113
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,369
So...

114
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,370
Oh, God.

115
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:48,207
The Neitherlands is
Grand Central for the multiverse.

116
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,611
<i>The button will bring you in,
and once you're there...</i>

117
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes, the fountains are portals.

118
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,075
Can I say this?

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,580
For your interest?

120
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,282
As far as I know,

121
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,983
you don't need
a button or anything

122
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,445
to ride the fountains,

123
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,053
so don't fall in.

124
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,415
Don't get lost.

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,457
The whole place is crawling

126
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,628
<i>with battle magic motherfuckers
with hoods on.</i>

127
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,657
<i>We get separated,</i>

128
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,096
you're dead.

129
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,957
Seriously,

130
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,766
what the fuck is going on
with you people?

131
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,846
Nothing.
We're fine, aren't we, El?

132
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,277
We're phenomenal.

133
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,750
Fine, okay.
We're not okay.

134
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,451
Forget it.
We just need to...

135
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,453
- We're going to...
- It's over!

136
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,286
I need a minute.

137
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,428
Alice is just a little bit
sensitive right now.

138
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,829
Would you just shut
the fuck up, Margo?

139
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,660
Are you seriously
mad at me right now?

140
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,125
What the fuck
did I just walk into?

141
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,001
My life. Welcome.

142
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,332
It's not funny,
and it's not a joke.

143
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,136
But it truly is, Quentin.

144
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,808
You people
need to stow your shit!

145
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,337
We get it!
Would you just, please,

146
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,311
give us a fucking goddamn minute?

147
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,236
How you doing?

148
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,067
Come on.

149
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,706
Stop worrying.

150
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,207
Fine.

151
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,010
- So the hermit was creepy.
- Super creepy.

152
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,011
You didn't feel what I felt.

153
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,813
I don't know.
Whatever he was channeling,

154
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,715
it was the real deal.

155
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,817
She's just nervous.

156
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,819
There's always some creepy guy

157
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,190
when you're about to blow

158
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,189
the patriarchy's head
out of their ass.

159
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,229
Everything is, um,

160
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,030
about to change...

161
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,901
everything, finally.

162
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,728
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

163
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,276
What?

164
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,051
Okay, you are the least crazy.

165
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:11,949
Tell me what's going on.

166
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,691
It... nothing.
Just forget it.

167
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,686
What the hell are you drinking?

168
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,458
I don't know.

169
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,527
Triple sec?

170
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,388
What did Quentin do?

171
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,796
I don't want to talk about it.

172
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,127
Fair enough.

173
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,873
Can I get some?

174
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,106
It's good.

175
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,154
It's not good.

176
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,808
No, it's not good.

177
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,146
Yeah.

178
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,992
Let you in on
a little secret, though.

179
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:51,717
I used to drink Midori
in high school.

180
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,827
It's like melon
crossed with perfume

181
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,628
crossed with ass.

182
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,731
Yum.

183
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,767
Fuck did I know?

184
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,237
I was trying to get
the voices to go away.

185
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,668
Point is, I'm not judging
anyone for triple sec.

186
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,246
And...

187
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,677
I can tell when someone's trying
to make something go away.

188
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,486
So Midori, hmm?

189
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,490
Does it work?

190
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,362
Nothing works forever.

191
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,698
But, you know,

192
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,699
if you stop worrying
about forever,

193
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,243
there's plenty of shit that can
get you through the next hour.

194
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,487
Is what he said
still bugging you?

195
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,988
He looked at me like
he could see through me.

196
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,232
And Kady doesn't seem
to share your reservation.

197
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,828
She seems better.

198
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,332
Yeah.

199
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,702
I don't know why
I feel this way.

200
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:15,042
Our Lady came to me in a dream.
Shouldn't that remove all doubt?

201
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:17,911
Look, something like this
is about intention,

202
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:22,180
what we bring into it.
Our intentions are pure.

203
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,750
- So just stop worrying?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,184
Just like...

205
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,345
For now.

206
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,324
Tomorrow you can worry
all you want

207
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:31,723
about Our Lady Underground.

208
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,159
Tonight... tonight should be
about Dionysus.

209
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,561
Whoo, ooh.

210
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,898
Dionysus, okay.

211
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,499
You, uh...

212
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,371
you bang a lot of undergrads
with that one?

213
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,000
Fewer than I'd hoped.

214
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,229
- Hmm?
- Say it works.

215
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,869
And that means what for you?

216
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,470
You asking if I'm coming back?

217
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,372
Kind of, yeah.

218
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,646
I hadn't much planned for it really.
I just want to get there,

219
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:32,117
and I'll stay
or go somewhere quiet.

220
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,418
If Our Lady
has other plans, hmm,

221
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,389
I'll do that.

222
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,620
I'll miss you.

223
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,925
I'll miss you too.

224
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,668
To think you were so crabby in rehab,
we almost never spoke.

225
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,438
God, you are really
something, Julia.

226
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,141
I bet you say that
to all the girls

227
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,283
you slept with
three minutes ago.

228
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,108
- That's funny.
- Hmm.

229
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,849
But I mean it. I do.

230
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,680
That bite, that...

231
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,815
that thing in you that wants
to puzzle everything out,

232
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,620
that is gold.

233
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,192
No matter how crabby
it makes me?

234
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,004
I think especially
when it makes you crabby.

235
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,797
I think that us angry,

236
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,700
questioning people
sometimes shut up too fast,

237
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:28,673
and that is probably part
of why the gods took off.

238
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:34,513
No one around with the fire
to keep yelling their names.

239
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,982
This is gonna sound corny,

240
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,518
but don't lose that fire.

241
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,289
Well, it sounds like
you're saying good-bye.

242
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,588
I'm saying thank you.

243
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,325
So this is a little hitch
in our adventure.

244
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,400
Are we just gonna act
like children now?

245
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:55,669
Now, now, Bambi.
He's got a right to be mad.

246
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,968
No, he doesn't.

247
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,844
People don't get to be mad at me
because I had sex with them.

248
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:02,169
You're welcome, both of you.

249
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,465
Oh, come on.

250
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,706
We were all messed up
on emotion magic.

251
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,482
- We deserve a pass.
- I don't need a pass.

252
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:09,911
You two have ruined my life.

253
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,847
No offense, Quentin,
but I think you did that all yourself.

254
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,192
Can we just cut to the part
where we go to another world

255
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:19,197
and skip the whole guilt
and recriminations bit, please?

256
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,060
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

257
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,361
Is it wrong that I'm starting
to side with The Beast?

258
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,577
Mmm.

259
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,708
Ah! Ah.

260
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,576
Fuck.

261
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,765
All right.

262
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,286
Didn't think
you had that in you.

263
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,792
You don't get to shame me.

264
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,194
You slept with two other people.
We broke up.

265
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:33,493
I was out of my mind.

266
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,432
I made a mistake,
and you aimed a weapon.

267
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,426
I'm glad it hurt.
It should hurt.

268
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,135
Boys and girls,

269
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,970
I hate to cut into
what is clearly a moment,

270
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,506
but the fact is,

271
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,911
according to the best
and only magic we have,

272
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,154
we have to go
or The Beast will kill us.

273
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,449
End of story.

274
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,318
Take out your emotions.

275
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,919
You can fight later.

276
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,021
Sound good?

277
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,285
All right, if you guys
are using those emotion bottles,

278
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,985
let's go.

279
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,633
How I was feeling about Quentin
would have got us all killed.

280
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,697
I was very angry a moment ago,

281
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,499
but I have to be honest.

282
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,370
You two would make
a cute couple.

283
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,965
Join hands, everyone.

284
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,557
Let's move, fast.

285
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,358
The map says...

286
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,430
Got it.

287
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,198
Quentin?

288
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,599
We've been waiting.

289
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,701
Run!

290
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,679
Shit.

291
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,059
We certainly lost that fight.

292
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,286
- How'd you find this place?
- Got lucky last time.

293
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,393
Quentin had the map.

294
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,896
- Shit.
- No map,

295
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,866
evil mercenary assholes
everywhere, stuck in a library...

296
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,067
this is not how we decided
this would go.

297
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,869
Penny, you know this place.

298
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,907
There must be somebody
we can talk to.

299
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,611
Yeah, there might be.
Follow me.

300
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,888
Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet,

301
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,322
you are all late.

302
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,991
Actually, it's Margo.

303
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,092
This time.

304
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,631
Look, we need your help,

305
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:18,058
though you probably
already knew that.

306
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,297
I did.

307
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,398
The answer is yes, you can stay,

308
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,930
with a few caveats.

309
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,225
Here it comes.

310
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,296
One, no harm comes to the books.

311
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,806
Yeah, we get that.

312
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,738
Two, no food, drinks,
or any other intoxicants

313
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,013
are allowed in the library
at any time.

314
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,028
That includes emotion bottles.

315
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,427
Damage always ensues.

316
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,830
You understand, of course.

317
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,311
I planned my whole outfit
around that bottle!

318
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,621
Could you get
to the point, Quentin?

319
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,278
I have a trustees meeting.

320
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,486
You know something about
what's been happening here...

321
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,057
The Beast, Eliza.

322
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,858
I would like to know
what is really going on here.

323
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,296
I know you would,
but we are done.

324
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,630
- How did you lose your virginity?
- I was 24 years old.

325
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,235
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

326
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,167
She was considerably
older than I

327
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,641
and, oh, much, much
more experienced.

328
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,310
But...

329
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,579
Fuck!

330
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,080
You've managed to dose me,
haven't you?

331
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,352
In my tea.
You little shit.

332
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,356
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

333
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,017
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

334
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,385
you would have done so already,
but you haven't.

335
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,230
Eliza...
who is she?

336
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,398
Eliza's real name
is Jane Chatwin.

337
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,069
Oh...

338
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,307
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one. Uh...

339
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,080
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

340
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:17,048
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book

341
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,549
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

342
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,688
Uh, yeah, Ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

343
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:28,225
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time on a cosmic scale,

344
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,957
and Jane used it
to create a time loop.

345
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,025
When she'd fail to stop The Beast,
she'd restart the loop.

346
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:40,871
A time loop.
Okay. Uh...

347
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,142
So what do we have to do
with The Beast?

348
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,712
You just keep getting involved.

349
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,581
I don't keep doing anything.

350
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,110
Can you imagine, Quentin,

351
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,952
how many times we've had
this exact conversation?

352
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,553
You've managed to slip
truth serum to me 27 times,

353
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,386
27 ways, and I'm quite sick of it.

354
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,232
So, what, this is just some giant,
blood-soaked "Groundhog Day"?

355
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,729
You always bring up
that fucking movie.

356
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,461
I still haven't seen it.

357
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,327
Now it's a point of pride.

358
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,736
Answer my question.

359
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:16,739
In each loop,
Jane alters something

360
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,642
to see if it'll
change the outcome.

361
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,475
The sigil that appeared
on your hand,

362
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,147
brought you to Alice...

363
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,248
that was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

364
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,921
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

365
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,490
and we all know how well
that particular great idea

366
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:32,957
worked out, don't we?

367
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,758
So has anything actually helped?

368
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,860
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

369
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,463
How many times have I died?

370
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,925
39.

371
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,933
39 times.

372
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,795
And if you die a 40th,

373
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,203
at least I won't
have to hear you

374
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,865
ask me this question ever again.

375
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,776
Jane's dead, Quentin.

376
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,277
The loop's done.

377
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,509
There's no one to reset it.

378
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,345
So this is it?

379
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,018
This isn't my problem.

380
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,019
My problem is that
I'm strong enough

381
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,121
to discern a time loop

382
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,893
but not strong enough
to change it.

383
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:07,558
We better hope and pray

384
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,459
that Jane altered the right
thing this time around.

385
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,662
Anything else, Quentin?

386
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,595
What's different this time?

387
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,138
Please, no books on the floor.

388
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,047
I love this one.

389
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,917
Photos from places
I can't imagine.

390
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,748
I know you hate it now,

391
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,756
but travelers wrote
our most precious books.

392
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,687
The library is what it is
because of them.

393
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,662
You make it sound
so simple and fun.

394
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,166
No. But it is valuable.

395
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,727
And in my observation,

396
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,535
master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

397
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,376
I was looking
for any technical info

398
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,237
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but...

399
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,906
The books you seek
are in another branch.

400
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,876
Of course they are.

401
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,045
Look, could you...
could you expedite that shit?

402
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,785
I don't have much time,

403
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,890
and I really need to know
how to take people with me.

404
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,393
I'll put in a request.

405
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,456
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

406
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,465
Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote "The Trial"

407
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,936
after spending a week
in the library.

408
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:29,367
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

409
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,635
you will get a handle on it.

410
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,580
I promise.

411
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,648
If?

412
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,419
Say that in my book?

413
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,491
No spoilers.

414
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
Hi.

415
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,123
- I was at Brakebills?
- You were supposed to be.

416
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,460
Or you were, like, 39 times.

417
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,261
You were the thing they changed.

418
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,433
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

419
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:28,472
and you would get stronger,
and...

420
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,797
So I was right.

421
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,937
The whole time, I was right.

422
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,558
I don't know
what to say, Jules. I...

423
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,911
I should have
believed you, Jules.

424
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,480
I should have known,
and I'm... I'm...

425
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,649
Um...

426
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,486
Look, that doesn't make up
for what I did to you,

427
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:52,517
which was stupid

428
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,827
and vindictive

429
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:59,728
and really dangerous.

430
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:03,331
I'm so sorry, Q.

431
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,895
Thank you.

432
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,035
- So how do we fix it?
- I don't know.

433
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,484
I just know that
I'm gonna get killed soon,

434
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,480
and I don't really want to die

435
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:20,718
being mad at my oldest friend.

436
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,891
- I really fucking missed you.
- Yeah, me, too, actually.

437
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,434
You smell the same.

438
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,840
Okay, all right. Uh...

439
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,441
So...

440
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,278
Big conspiracy.

441
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,679
Wheels within wheels.

442
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,281
Julia doesn't go
to Brakebills, and?

443
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:55,419
You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

444
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,690
It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

445
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,360
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

446
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:05,029
I can barely believe it.

447
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,900
Wha... what?

448
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,991
Some friends and I got into
some pretty eclectic shit.

449
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:15,635
You and Kady?
Where is she?

450
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,571
On a mission.

451
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,376
They all are.

452
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,800
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

453
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,248
From?

454
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,149
A goddess.

455
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,952
We summoned, and she came.

456
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,816
You mean, um, here?

457
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,626
To your loft?

458
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,127
You don't believe me.
Shit, I wouldn't either.

459
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,430
That is why she gave me proof.

460
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,201
- Is that milk?
- Yeah.

461
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:53,641
Cool, useless, kind of gross.

462
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,275
But look under the hood.

463
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,120
Oh, my God.

464
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,822
Who did this magic?

465
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,926
I told you.
She did.

466
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,787
I mean, it was crazy.

467
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,656
It was like being
on a massive dose of ecstasy.

468
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,296
When she touched me,

469
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,539
it was like my psyche
was defragging.

470
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,697
I mean, she...
she touched all of us.

471
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,936
She granted every petition.

472
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,211
She cured Menolly's
breast cancer;

473
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:28,710
she sent Richard
to where he wanted to go.

474
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,281
I watched this.

475
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,152
I thought magic
couldn't cure cancer.

476
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,950
Not regular magic.

477
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,387
Look, I can't lie, okay?

478
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,618
It was shitty going
for a while there,

479
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,015
not being in Brakebills,

480
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,486
but I can't sit here now

481
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,525
and think it was
anything but fate.

482
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,167
Right, or just the right
random combination.

483
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,598
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

484
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,776
I need your help.

485
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,511
I don't know how to get back,

486
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,812
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

487
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,015
and I just... I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

488
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,178
and I have to find a way, um...

489
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,516
Let me get this straight.

490
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,991
You want me to come
to Fillory with you.

491
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,032
Uh, yeah.

492
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,556
Come here.

493
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,396
Holy shit.
This is our table.

494
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,873
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

495
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,692
We kind of have, huh?

496
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:31,342
Our Lady gave me a mission to...

497
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,543
I sound like a nutjob.

498
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,575
Kind of.

499
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,680
What's the mission?

500
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,719
She said it was my destiny

501
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,120
to basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

502
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,293
You know, she said
it was something

503
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:51,796
that couldn't be given.
It had to be found.

504
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:55,966
So we have to find it.

505
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,767
And I bet you it's here.

506
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,799
So I guess we're off
to see the Wizard.

507
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,466
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

508
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:08,212
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,
and then their mom dies, 1941.

509
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,882
Q, where are you
going with this?

510
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:12,781
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

511
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,453
but we do know when they open...

512
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,787
every time the Chatwins go.

513
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,418
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

514
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,591
then we could follow 'em in.

515
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,126
Uh...

516
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:26,097
Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

517
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,258
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

518
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,066
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

519
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,969
Wait, but that would put us
in past Fillory, right?

520
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,140
Fillory is magic.

521
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,809
Remember,
Jane falls in that swamp,

522
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,580
and then she comes out
20 years later.

523
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:44,678
She strikes a deal with
the Watcherwoman to send her back.

524
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:49,153
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

525
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,821
I have an idea,

526
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,552
something Richard told me,

527
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:55,092
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

528
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,861
Brakebills.

529
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,192
Okay.

530
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,926
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

531
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,299
in order to get
through the wards.

532
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,468
Alumni key.

533
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,039
Richard gave it to me.

534
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,268
This place is impossible.
How does anyone find anything?

535
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,876
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

536
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,547
What have you got?
Anything?

537
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,478
"The Book of Mike McCormick."

538
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,483
Novella, really.

539
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,623
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

540
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,458
But the worst part?

541
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,527
His life was happy.

542
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,958
Eliot, he's gone.

543
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,732
Why are you torturing yourself?

544
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:36,167
Because he's gone
and it's my fault.

545
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,868
And of all the people
in the world

546
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,839
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

547
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,344
- What are you doing?
- Putting the past behind me.

548
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,643
No, stop!

549
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,976
Look, he's had
a really bad week.

550
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,580
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

551
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,582
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

552
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,645
It's one book.

553
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,721
No, it's a life.

554
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,522
They're irreplaceable.

555
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,659
No, wait!

556
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,330
What did you do?

557
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,371
Let's go.

558
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,004
<i>"Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

559
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,936
"Bridge to the Cretaceous period."

560
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,544
Oh, hey, here's one.

561
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,045
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

562
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,548
Voyage of the "Titanic."

563
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,250
Oh, fun.

564
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,892
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

565
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:31,017
to one specific
point in time and...

566
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,860
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

567
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:36,028
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

568
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,287
All got used up by the '70s.

569
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,796
Wait a minute.

570
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,866
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

571
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,567
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

572
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,739
"Operation Die Fuehrer."

573
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,870
Guess no one told 'em Hitler was

574
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,405
a pretty serious
battle Magician?

575
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,909
Yeah.

576
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,979
Uh, yep, and Hitler killed them.

577
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,480
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

578
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,217
Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

579
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,918
April 19th.

580
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,751
Yeah.

581
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,656
You remember the, uh...
yeah, "The Flying Forest."

582
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,111
Yeah, uh,
Jane's going into town.

583
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,833
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

584
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:17,601
April 21, 1942.

585
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,702
Two days after this time bridge.

586
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,474
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

587
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,743
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

588
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:27,811
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

589
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,352
Yeah.

590
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,849
Earth fountain's blocked off.

591
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,320
- I told you it would be.
- It was worth a shot.

592
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,222
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

593
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,623
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

594
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,164
of the library
in the first place?

595
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,327
All right, let's keep moving.

596
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,928
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

597
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,700
We're highly trained
Earth magicians.

598
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,169
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from Brakebills?

599
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,137
Dude, Josh Hoberman,
class of '16.

600
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,308
Come with me
if you want to live.

601
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,307
I've always wanted to say that.

602
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,852
But seriously, um, we should go.

603
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,498
Welcome to <i>Chez Hoberman</i>.

604
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,387
You're welcome to whatever.

605
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,992
Just don't eat the carrots.

606
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,163
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

607
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,333
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

608
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,735
Holy shit.
This tastes like pizza.

609
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,237
Yeah, I know, right?

610
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,668
How long have you
been down here?

611
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,173
A few weeks.

612
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,565
Just been camped out,

613
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,036
waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

614
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,178
Anyone else?

615
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,679
From my class.

616
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
Look, don't freak,
but back at Brakebills,

617
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,052
nobody knows what happened
to you guys.

618
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:41,680
And it's sort of been two years.

619
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,146
Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

620
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,655
Victoria warned me about that.

621
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,426
Victoria?
You know her?

622
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,387
She's the only reason I'm alive.

623
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,126
Look are you gonna tell us

624
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,931
what the fuck happened
to your class, or what?

625
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,033
Where'd you guys go?

626
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,068
To Fillory for spring break.

627
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,771
V's amazing.

628
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,873
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

629
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,376
<i>Teachers put this tattoo
on her to stop her.</i>

630
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,246
She just cut it off herself.

631
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,607
- Joshy.
- What?

632
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,905
- You're not gonna believe it.
- What?

633
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,276
I did it.
I found Fillory.

634
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,845
- What?
- I found Fillory!

635
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,422
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo! We're going to Fillory!

636
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,962
- We're going to Fillory?
- Uh-huh!

637
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,687
<i>So we decided to plan a trip.</i>

638
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,532
<i>You know, party,
smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

639
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,427
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

640
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,929
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first year class,</i>

641
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,731
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

642
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,202
<i>Luckily, V was so good,</i>

643
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:32,141
<i>she was able
to take them all with.</i>

644
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,267
<i>It was magical.</i>

645
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:38,142
<i>I mean,
more magical than Brakebills,</i>

646
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:41,412
<i>like going from black and white
to color.</i>

647
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,813
V and I had a threesome
with a Naiad.

648
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,475
This guy Donnie,
he had sex with a talking horse.

649
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,745
I mean, it's not exactly
taboo in Fillory

650
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,392
since the animals
can give consent,

651
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,119
but we were all still
a bit squicked out.

652
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,394
We get it.
You fucked some animals.

653
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:58,729
How'd you end up here?

654
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,198
Got roped into this quest.

655
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,595
Ended up being a trap
for Victoria.

656
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,738
This dude... Mothra,
I've been calling him...

657
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,109
Yeah, we know that clown.

658
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,167
It was a bloodbath.

659
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,456
V zapped me here,
and then she went back in.

660
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:17,948
Told me to stay put,
so I have just been waiting.

661
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,179
V should have been here by now.

662
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,487
He caught her.

663
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,690
But she's still alive.

664
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,291
How do you know that?

665
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,662
I'm like her.
It's why I'm here.

666
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,098
We can all go, rescue Victoria.

667
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,329
You can take us.

668
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,368
I...

669
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,269
haven't exactly cracked

670
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,141
the whole ride-along yet.

671
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,542
Okay, forget traveling.

672
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,313
Uh, we'll just take a fountain.

673
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,512
Except we don't know
where the Fillory fountain is.

674
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,945
That's easy.

675
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,520
It's three squares up,
one square left.

676
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:58,921
The problem is all the battle magic
dick buckets waiting to vaporize us.

677
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:00,922
Discuss.

678
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,031
It's in the closet.

679
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:12,536
El and Margo made a door
to their favorite pub in London.

680
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,867
They look like fun.

681
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,373
Look, you were supposed
to be here.

682
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,874
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

683
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,736
No, you know,
I think Jane was right.

684
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,211
Had I been here living it up,

685
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,812
I would have never
felt the need to figure out

686
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,383
what magic is actually for.

687
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:26,782
Okay, so what's magic
actually for, then?

688
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,153
For fixing things, dummy.

689
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,657
Trust me.

690
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:37,728
I, uh, made a lot of mistakes
before I figured that one out.

691
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,998
Yeah, everything I've been
able to fix doesn't matter,

692
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,025
just minor mendings
and bullshit.

693
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,565
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

694
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,739
everyone would do it.

695
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,840
Come on.

696
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:56,008
Alice.

697
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,849
Get some sleep.

698
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,517
I know.

699
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,018
I might as well.

700
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,688
I'll never figure this out.

701
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,998
Trying to think of how to get us
all to the Fillory fountain

702
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,592
without getting us killed.

703
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,927
Need a hand?

704
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:19,436
Look, Penny,

705
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,367
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea, but...

706
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,741
Whoa, stop.

707
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,579
It was fun, okay?

708
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,949
You're one of the few people
I actually respect.

709
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,718
Uh, yeah, you're right, right.

710
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,749
I'm just making this weird, huh?

711
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,754
Eh, it's weird.

712
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,056
We're weird.
So what?

713
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,399
We're friends, right?

714
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,595
I just keep thinking
about Quentin.

715
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,304
Look, I know.

716
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,135
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

717
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,840
if, out of all of us,
he was the one

718
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,142
who didn't get to see Fillory.

719
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,180
And then I remember
that I hate him.

720
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,081
Fuck, why am I such an idiot?

721
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,483
Okay.

722
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:10,287
Quentin is irrelevant.

723
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,288
Just another excuse
for that thing you always do.

724
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,321
What thing?

725
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,233
"I should just give up.
I'll never figure it out."

726
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:19,242
Shit got real.

727
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:23,555
If you're gonna drop
that bullshit, now's the time.

728
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:25,128
<i>Phosphoromancy.</i>

729
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,038
I can bend light around us,
all of us, the whole group, I think,

730
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,840
make us invisible.

731
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,837
It'll be difficult with the two suns
but not impossible.

732
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,275
We'll have to move
in a pretty tight formation.

733
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,650
- When should we leave?
- As soon as possible.

734
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,300
The suns are just about
in position.

735
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:41,498
It has begun!

736
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,816
Sorry.

737
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,688
Penny, Eliot, you're both tall,

738
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,659
so you'll have to duck down
and stay close to me, okay?

739
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,558
- Or they'll see you.
- Got it.

740
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,701
We got it, right?

741
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,001
Eliot, are you coming?

742
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,669
Right behind you, Bambi.

743
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,412
Let's do this.

744
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,416
Okay.

745
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,556
Holy shit.

746
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,931
Is that an air raid siren?

747
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay. 1942.

748
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,701
- We need to get out of here.
- Yeah.

749
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,078
Go to the right.

750
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,001
Is everything all right, Eliot?

751
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:57,598
Everything's amazing.

752
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,398
Go left. Go left.

753
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,487
Yeah, I brought a gun.

754
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,118
Thanks, Margo.

755
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,226
You're welcome.
Why didn't you move?

756
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,387
Acid carrots.

757
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,301
Margo, you saved my actual life.

758
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:40,003
Hooray, you live
to drink another day.

759
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,439
- Oh, shit, guys, they see us.
- Shit! Go! Go!

760
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,111
Oh, my God.

761
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,280
She looks so young.

762
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,151
Yeah, she's got
no idea what's coming.

763
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,790
Hey. That's got to be it, right?

764
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,547
Across the street,
the door to Fillory?

765
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:32,816
Yeah.

766
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,324
Ooh, here she comes.

767
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,166
You ready, Janey?

768
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,798
Why, yes, Martin, I think I am.

769
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,059
Oh, my God.

770
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,333
Q.

771
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,138
Look.
