<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:02,479
What does that mean?

3
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,316
<i>Jesus, we could not have screwed up</i>

4
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:05,291
<i>that spell worse,
and we can't take it back.</i>

5
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:07,015
<i>It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand.</i>

6
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:08,781
<i>It appeared when I was
dreaming of Fillory.</i>

7
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:11,289
- <i>It came from Jane.</i>
- Who are you?

8
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,827
I'm a member of The Order,

9
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:14,582
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands.

10
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,002
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are,

11
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,171
<i>trying to kill me?</i>

12
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:18,392
They've been thoroughly cursed,

13
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:20,179
so they can't use the fountains,

14
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,683
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment.

15
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:23,237
The Beast?

16
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,074
We are the best Magicians we know,

17
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,779
but Menolly is dying.

18
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:28,450
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

19
00:00:28,502 --> 00:00:29,536
And you?

20
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:30,589
Eight years ago,

21
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:31,924
I was a drug addict,

22
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,553
and I left my son in a hot car.

23
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:37,723
We're not learning anything new.

24
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,059
Beast always kills us.

25
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,896
There was one time
we didn't all die--

26
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:42,231
when we went to Fillory.

27
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:43,904
<i>Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.</i>

28
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,742
Bottling our emotions...

29
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,787
<i>When the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.</i>

30
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,612
<i>Near the bridge, there's a man</i>

31
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:02,784
who has served me a thousand years.

32
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:06,627
Bring him three gifts.
He'll show you the way.

33
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,216
Huh.
Not what I expected.

34
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,804
Yeah.

35
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,562
Die, fucker!

36
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,661
Well, that sucked ass.

37
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:57,752
Julia, Kady!

38
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:00,259
Finally.
<i>Bienvenidas.</i>

39
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,597
Are we interrupting or--

40
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,770
Oh, no, no, no.
Just passing the time.

41
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:05,939
So...

42
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:08,110
Uh, yeah, um...

43
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,283
We bring forsythia...

44
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:12,038
Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,878
And honeycomb.

46
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,715
Hmm.

47
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,854
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

48
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,026
<i>Muy bien, chicas.</i>

49
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,563
<i>Muy bien.</i>

50
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:24,200
Two down.

51
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:26,321
Where's the platinum?

52
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:27,658
We didn't bring that.

53
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,997
Too bad.
Exit through the gift shop.

54
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:34,843
But we did bring something
of great and shining worth.

55
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,182
Just say it.

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,236
If you're wrong, you're wrong.

57
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:46,371
We brought you our faith.

58
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:48,376
Ooh.

59
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,596
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

60
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:53,388
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

61
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,942
I like it.

62
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:57,950
But to be honest,
I'm sensing more skepticism

63
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:00,908
than faith here.

64
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:05,670
Look, um, I'm trying.

65
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:07,423
She's the one
that had the dream, okay?

66
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,512
Hey.

67
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,521
Kady, your mother used your faith,

68
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:17,531
but she isn't your true mother.

69
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,621
Our Lady feels you require a miracle.

70
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:34,573
Oh, my God.

71
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,327
Wha--what ha--

72
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,664
What did he do?

73
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:38,666
I don't--
I don't know.

74
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,053
I've had this tightness

75
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:44,013
ever since my mom, but it's gone.

76
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:47,605
Ah, there it is.

77
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:51,499
Faith.

78
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:55,041
Okay, so...

79
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:57,713
Let's get to brass.

80
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:00,053
You're here why?

81
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,893
We seek an audience
with Our Lady Underground.

82
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,980
Yeah, no shit.

83
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:08,122
Why do you think
you deserve to see her?

84
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,667
- Hmm?
- It's okay.

85
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,757
Why should she waste
her time with you?

86
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,148
I am privileged,

87
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:19,852
and I have done some stupid shit,

88
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,654
and I have been through nothing

89
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,277
compared to some of my friends.

90
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,947
So you wish to help them?

91
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,835
Heal them?
Is that it?

92
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,126
Yes, that is exactly
what I want to do.

93
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,465
No.

94
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:33,718
No, no, no.

95
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,062
Magicians...

96
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:40,736
that's all you ever want,
power, every time.

97
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,412
You know what?

98
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,215
For the longest time,

99
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,674
that is all I wanted.

100
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:51,228
But now I just want to do

101
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:53,400
whatever the fuck it is
I'm supposed to.

102
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:56,573
And if she's around,
if she gives a shit,

103
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,364
I have to believe
she wants her daughters

104
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,706
to show a little ambition.

105
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:08,103
So you tell her that I am trying

106
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,559
to reach something higher.

107
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,903
<i>Nuestra SeГ±ora</i> sits and waits,

108
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,327
and no one asks.

109
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,249
She watches.

110
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,007
She weeps.

111
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,766
But today, she's
grinning like a fool.

112
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,157
Here's the invocation.

113
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:33,115
May her blessings be with you.

114
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,618
Thank you.

115
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,206
And one more piece
of advice for the chosen.

116
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,719
You can't unring a bell,

117
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:45,311
so be certain when you call, Julia.

119
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,668
Okay.

120
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,878
Look...

121
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:20,113
All y'all look like
you did a crime last night.

122
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,252
According to all
the probability shit,

123
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:30,973
we don't have time to wait.

124
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,679
One or another super shitty ending

125
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,984
is coming within days

126
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,858
if we don't at least
try to go get the knife.

127
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:40,913
So...

128
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,953
Oh, God.

129
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:47,797
The Neitherlands is Grand
Central for the multiverse.

130
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,135
<i>The button will bring you in,</i>

131

00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,025
Yes, the fountains are portals.

133
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,645
Can I say this?

134
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,149
For your interest?

135
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,869
As far as I know,

136
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,574
you don't need a button or anything

137
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,044
to ride the fountains,

138
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,665
so don't fall in.

139
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,001
Don't get lost.

140
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:05,057
The whole place is crawling

141

142
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:09,266
<i>We get separated,</i>

143
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:10,687
you're dead.

144
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,575
Seriously,

145
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,368
what the fuck is going on
with you people?

146
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:27,477
Nothing.
We're fine, aren't we, El?

147
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,897
We're phenomenal.

148
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,404
Fine, okay.
We're not okay.

149
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,074
Forget it.
We just need to--

150
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:36,082
- We're going to--
- It's over!

151
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,922
I need a minute.

152
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:42,098
Alice is just a little bit
sensitive right now.

153
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,485
Would you just shut
the fuck up, Margo?

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,322
Are you seriously
mad at me right now?

155
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:46,800
What the fuck did I just walk into?

156
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:48,664
My life. Welcome.

157
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,999
It's not funny, and it's not a joke.

158
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,788
But it truly is, Quentin.

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,458
You people need to stow your shit!

160
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,011
We get it!
Would you just, please,

161
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,968
give us a goddamn minute?

162
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:12,673

166
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,949
How you doing?

167
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,788
Come on.

168
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,425
Stop worrying.

169
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:28,929
Fine.

170
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:30,466
So the hermit was creepy.

171
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:31,720
Super creepy.

172
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,725
You didn't feel what I felt.

173
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:35,561
I don't know.
Whatever he was channeling,

174
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,450
it was the real deal.

175
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,572
She's just nervous.

176
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,577
There's always some creepy guy

177
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:42,913
when you're about to blow

178
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,918
the patriarchy's head
out of their ass.

179
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,980
Everything is, um,

180
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,769
about to change...

181
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,107
everything,

182
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,661
finally.

183
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,951

- Yeah.
- Cheers.

185
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:00,706
<i>в™Є Just celebrate в™Є</i>

186
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,058
What?

187
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,812
Okay, you are the least crazy.

188
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,734
Tell me what's going on.

189
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,457
It--nothing.
Just forget it.

190
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:17,498
What the hell are you drinking?

191
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,252
I don't know.

192
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,340
Triple sec?

193
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:23,179
What did Quentin do?

194
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,600
I don't want to talk about it.

195
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:26,938
Fair enough.

196
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,662
Can I get some?

197
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:40,938
It's good.

198
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:41,976
It's not good.

199
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:43,646
No, it's not good.

200
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,984
Yeah.

201
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,823
Let you in on
a little secret, though.

202
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,581
I used to drink Midori
in high school.

203
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:55,676
It's like melon crossed with perfume

204
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,482
crossed with ass.

205
00:09:58,518 --> 00:09:59,601
Yum.

206
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,606
Fuck did I know?

207
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:05,115
I was trying to get
the voices to go away.

208
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:09,509
Point is, I'm not judging
anyone for triple sec.

209
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:14,138
And...

210
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,529
I can tell when someone's trying
to make something go away.

211
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,378
So Midori, hmm?

212
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,383
Does it work?

213
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:30,259
Nothing works forever.

214
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:32,600
But, you know,

215
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:36,609
if you stop worrying about forever,

216
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,116
there's plenty of shit that can
get you through the next hour.

217
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,404
Is what he said still bugging you?

218
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,914
He looked at me like
he could see through me.

219
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:02,171
And Kady doesn't seem
to share your reservation.

220
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:05,764
She seems better.

221
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:07,267
Yeah.

222
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,659
I don't know why I feel this way.

223
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,831
Our Lady came to me in a dream.

224
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:15,003
Shouldn't that remove all doubt?

225
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:17,877
Look, something like this
is about intention,

226
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,965
what we bring into it.

227
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:22,137
Our intentions are pure.

228
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,641
So just stop worrying?

229
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:24,727
Yeah.

230
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,147
Just like...

231
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,319
For now.

232
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,325
Tomorrow you can worry all you want

233
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:31,711
about Our Lady Underground.

234
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,331
Tonight...

235
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:35,170
tonight should be about Dionysus.

236
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,556
Whoo, ooh.

237
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:39,897
Dionysus, okay.

238
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,518
You, uh...

239
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,359
you bang a lot of undergrads
with that one?

240
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,029
Fewer than I'd hoped.

241
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,120
- Hmm?
- Say it works.

242
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,259
And that means what for you?

243
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,381
You asking if I'm coming back?

244
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:22,271
Kind of, yeah.

245
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,529
I hadn't much planned for it really.

246
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:27,567
I just want to get there,

247
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:32,044
and I'll stay or go somewhere quiet.

248
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,337
If Our Lady has other plans, hmm,

249
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,340
I'll do that.

250
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,564
I'll miss you.

251
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,852
I'll miss you too.

252
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,784
To think you were so crabby in rehab,

253
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,420
we almost never spoke.

254
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,094
Hey.

255
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,385
God, you are really something, Julia.

256
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,106
I bet you say that to all the girls

257
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,228
you slept with three minutes ago.

258
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,066
- That's funny.
- Hmm.

259
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,822
But I mean it.
I do.

260
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,661
That bite, that--

261
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:07,798
that thing in you that wants
to puzzle everything out,

262
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:10,590
that is gold.

263
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,185
No matter how crabby it makes me?

264
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:17,991
I think especially
when it makes you crabby.

265
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,780
I think that us angry,

266
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,704
questioning people
sometimes shut up too fast,

267
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:28,683
and that is probably part
of why the gods took off.

268
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:31,357
No one around with the fire

269
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:34,531
to keep yelling their names.

270
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,820
This is gonna sound corny,

271
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:39,543
but don't lose that fire.

272
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,334
Well, it sounds like
you're saying good-bye.

273
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:44,506
I'm saying thank you.

274
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,356
So this is a little hitch
in our adventure.

275
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,443
Are we just gonna act
like children now?

276
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,699
Now, now, Bambi.
He's got a right to be mad.

277
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,036
No, he doesn't.

278
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,373
People don't get to be mad at me

279
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,876
because I had sex with them.

280
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:02,216
You're welcome, both of you.

281
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,553
Oh, come on.

282
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,774
We were all messed up
on emotion magic.

283
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,278
We deserve a pass.

284
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,565
I don't need a pass.

285
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,985
You two have ruined my life.

286
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:11,288
No offense, Quentin,

287
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:12,908
but I think you did that
all yourself.

288
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,080
Can we just cut to the part
where we go to another world

289
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:19,257
and skip the whole guilt
and recriminations bit, please?

290
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,148
You would like that, wouldn't you?

291
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:25,322
Is it wrong that I'm starting
to side with The Beast?

292
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:38,689
Mmm.

293
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,818
Ah! Ah.

294
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,705
Fuck.

295
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,920
All right.

296
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,332
Didn't think you had that in you.

297
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:28,979
You don't get to shame me.

298
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:31,267
You slept with two other people.
We broke up.

299
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,523
I was out of my mind.

300
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,196
I made a mistake,

301
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:37,617
and you aimed a weapon.

302
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,622
I'm glad it hurt.
It should hurt.

303
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,342
Boys and girls,

304
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:44,183
I hate to cut into
what is clearly a moment,

305
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,720
but the fact is,

306
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,142
according to the best
and only magic we have,

307
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:50,364
we have to go
or The Beast will kill us.

308
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,651
End of story.

309
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:53,539
Take out your emotions.

310
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:55,159
You can fight later.

311
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,214
Sound good?

312
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:02,510
All right, if you guys
are using those emotion bottles,

313
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,232
let's go.

314
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:34,891
How I was feeling about Quentin
would have got us all killed.

315
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,987
I was very angry a moment ago,

316
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:41,774
but I have to be honest.

317
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,662
You two would make a cute couple.

318
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:49,260
Join hands, everyone.

319
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:05,884
Let's move, fast.

320
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,671
The map says--

321
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:10,728
Got it.

322
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:13,518
Quentin?

323
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,939
We've been waiting.

324
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,037
Run!

325
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:30,026
Shit.

326
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,882
We certainly lost that fight.

327
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:39,245
How'd you find this place?

328
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,326
Got lucky last time.

329
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:42,413
Quentin had the map.

330
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,917
- Shit.
- No map,

331
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:45,588
evil mercenary assholes everywhere,

332
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,925
stuck in a library--

333
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,097
this is not how we decided
this would go.

334
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:51,938
Penny, you know this place.

335
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,945
There must be somebody
we can talk to.

336
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:56,699
Yeah, there might be.

337
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:58,670
Follow me.

338
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,979
Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet,

339
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:10,416
you are all late.

340
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,087
Actually, it's Margo.

341
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:13,189
This time.

342
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:14,726
Look, we need your help,

343
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,167
though you probably
already knew that.

344
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:18,403
I did.

345
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:20,507
The answer is yes, you can stay,

346
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,011
with a few caveats.

347
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,347
Here it comes.

348
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:26,405
One, no harm comes to the books.

349
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:27,909
Yeah, we get that.

350
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,863
Two, no food, drinks,
or any other intoxicants

351
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:33,088
are allowed in the library
at any time.

352
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:47,156
That includes emotion bottles.

353
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,578
Damage always ensues.

354
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:55,978
You understand, of course.

355
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:01,441
I planned my whole outfit
around that bottle!

356
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,800
Could you get to the point, Quentin?

357
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,470
I have a trustees meeting.

358
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,642
You know something about
what's been happening here--

359
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,232
The Beast, Eliza.

360
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:21,040
I would like to know
what is really going on here.

361
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,659
I know you would,

362
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:24,497
but we are done.

363
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,670
How did you lose your virginity?

364
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:28,842
I was 24 years old.

365
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,429
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

366
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,351
She was considerably older than I

367
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:35,858
and, oh, much, much more experienced.

368
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,532
But...

369
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,788
Fuck!

370
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,294
You've managed to dose me,
haven't you?

371
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:46,552
In my tea.
You little shit.

372
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:50,561
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

373
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:52,233
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

374
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:54,621
you would have done so already,
but you haven't.

375
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:57,078
Eliza...

376
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,465
who is she?

377
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,508
Eliza's real name is Jane Chatwin.

378
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,315
Oh...

379
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,353
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

380
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:10,945
Uh...

381
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:13,334
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

382
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:16,291
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book

383
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,797
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

384
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,975
Uh, yeah, Ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

385
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,898
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time

386
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,486
on a cosmic scale,

387
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:30,242
and Jane used it
to create a time loop.

388
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,749
When she'd fail to stop The Beast,

389
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,336
she'd restart the loop.

390
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,839
A time loop.

391
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:38,179
Okay.

392
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:40,183
Uh...

393
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:43,441
So what do we have to do
with The Beast?

394
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,029
You just keep getting involved.

395
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:46,866
I don't keep doing anything.

396
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,421
Can you imagine, Quentin,

397
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:53,266
how many times we've had
this exact conversation?

398
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:56,891
You've managed to slip
truth serum to me 27 times,

399
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:59,731
27 ways, and I'm quite sick of it.

400
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:00,900
So, what, this is just some

401
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:02,573
giant, blood-soaked
"Groundhog Day"?

402
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:05,077
You always bring up
that fucking movie.

403
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,798
I still haven't seen it.

404
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,673
Now it's a point of pride.

405
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:11,092
Answer my question.

406
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,681
In each loop,

407
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:16,105
Jane alters something

408
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,995
to see if it'll change the outcome.

409
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:20,833
The sigil that appeared on your hand,

410
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,504
brought you to Alice--

411
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,626
that was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

412
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:27,299
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

413
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,554
and we all know how well
that particular great idea

414
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:32,311
worked out, don't we?

415
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,149
So has anything actually helped?

416
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:37,240
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

417
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:38,828
How many times have I died?

418
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,332
39.

419
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,336
39 times.

420
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:44,174
And if you die a 40th,

421
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,594
at least I won't have to hear you

422
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,267
ask me this question ever again.

423
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,191
Jane's dead, Quentin.

424
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,695
The loop's done.

425
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:55,918
There's no one to reset it.

426
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:57,757
So this is it?

427
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,428
This isn't my problem.

428
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:01,433
My problem is that I'm strong enough

429
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,556
to discern a time loop

430
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:05,309
but not strong enough to change it.

431
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:06,981
We better hope and pray

432
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,904
that Jane altered the right
thing this time around.

433
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,076
Anything else, Quentin?

434
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,997
What's different this time?

435
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,562
Please, no books on the floor.

436
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,499
I love this one.

437
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:32,376
Photos from places I can't imagine.

438
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:35,216
I know you hate it now,

439
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,224
but travelers wrote
our most precious books.

440
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:41,147
The library is what it is
because of them.

441
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,155
You make it sound so simple and fun.

442
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:45,908
No.

443
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,663
But it is valuable.

444
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:49,217
And in my observation,

445
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:53,009
master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

446
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:57,856
I was looking for any technical info

447
00:22:57,908 --> 00:23:00,746
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but--

448
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:03,418
The books you seek
are in another branch.

449
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:06,375
Of course they are.

450
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,551
Look, could you--
could you expedite that shit?

451
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,304
I don't have much time,

452
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,394
and I really need to know
how to take people with me.

453
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:16,902
I'll put in a request.

454
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:18,990
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

455
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:20,996
Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote "The Trial"

456
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:24,469
after spending a week in the library.

457
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:28,931
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

458
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:32,189
you will get a handle on it.

459
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,113
I promise.

460
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,201
If?

461
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,959
Say that in my book?

462
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:44,018
No spoilers.

463
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,165
Hi.

464
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,544
I was at Brakebills.

465
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:17,826
You were supposed to be.

466
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:21,159
Or you were, like, 39 times.

467
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:22,998
You were the thing they changed.

468
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,169
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

469
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,174
and you would get stronger,
and--

470
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,513
So I was right.

471
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,686
The whole time, I was right.

472
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:34,892
I don't know what to say, Jules. I...

473
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,561
I should have believed you, Jules.

474
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:41,209
I should have known,
and I'm--I'm...

475
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:43,381
Um...

476
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:47,223
Look, that doesn't make up
for what I did to you,

477
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:51,284
which was stupid

478
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,574
and vindictive

479
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:58,502
and really dangerous.

480
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:02,095
I'm so sorry, Q.

481
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:03,648
Thank you.

482
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:08,359
So how do we fix it?

483
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:11,534
I don't know.

484
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,287
I just know that
I'm gonna get killed soon,

485
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,292
and I don't really want to die

486
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:19,519
being mad at my oldest friend.

487
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:21,306
I really fucking missed you.

488
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,279
Yeah, me, too, actually.

489
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,223
You smell the same.

490
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,270
Okay, all right.

491
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:41,690
Uh...

492
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:44,280
So...

493
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,118
Big conspiracy.

494
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,538
Wheels within wheels.

495
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,045
Julia doesn't go to Brakebills, and?

496
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:54,273
You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

497
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:58,566
It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

498
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:01,239
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

499
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,912
I can barely believe it.

500
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:07,755
Wha--what?

501
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,678
Some friends and I got into
some pretty eclectic shit.

502
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,483
You and Kady?

503
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,522
Where is she?

504
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,442
On a mission.

505
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,284
They all are.

506
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,454
They got pretty strict
marching orders.

507
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:23,127
From?

508
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,050
A goddess.

509
00:26:26,102 --> 00:26:29,859
We summoned, and she came.

510
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:31,730
You mean, um, here?

511
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,536
To your loft?

512
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:37,043
You don't believe me.
Shit, I wouldn't either.

513
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:40,335
That is why she gave me proof.

514
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:47,854
Is that milk?

515
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,856
Yeah.

516
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,193
Cool,

517
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:51,245
useless,

518
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,581
kind of gross.

519
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:56,207
But look under the hood.

520
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,058
Oh, my God.

521
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,778
Who did this magic?

522
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:07,902
I told you.
She did.

523
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,741
I mean, it was crazy.

524
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:13,633
It was like being
on a massive dose of ecstasy.

525
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:15,254
When she touched me,

526
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:17,509
it was like my psyche was defragging.

527
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:19,681
I mean, she--
she touched all of us.

528
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,937
She granted every petition.

529
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,193
She cured Menolly's breast cancer;

530
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:27,701
she sent Richard
to where he wanted to go.

531
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,289
I watched this.

532
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,126
I thought magic couldn't cure cancer.

533
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:32,964
Not regular magic.

534
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,387
Look, I can't lie, okay?

535
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,645
It was shitty going
for a while there,

536
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:40,032
not being in Brakebills,

537
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:42,488
but I can't sit here now

538
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,545
and think it was anything but fate.

539
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,171
Right, or just the right
random combination.

540
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:51,592
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

541
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,525
I need your help.

542
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,363
I don't know how to get back,

543
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:02,870
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

544
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:05,043
and I just--I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

545
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,215
and I have to find
a way, um--

546
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:08,552
Let me get this straight.

547
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:13,062
You want me to come
to Fillory with you.

548
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:15,068
Uh, yeah.

549
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,631
Come here.

550
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,471
Holy shit.
This is our table.

551
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:25,928
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

552
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,649
We kind of have, huh?

553
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:30,439
Our Lady gave me
a mission to--

554
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,611
I sound like a nutjob.

555
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,666
Kind of.

556
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:37,789
What's the mission?

557
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,797
She said it was my destiny

558
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:44,221
to basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

559
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:46,394
You know, she said it was something

560
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:48,566
that couldn't be given.

561
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:50,906
It had to be found.

562
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:55,083
So we have to find it.

563
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,886
And I bet you it's here.

564
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:59,928
So I guess we're off
to see the Wizard.

565
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,600
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

566
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:05,074
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,

567
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,362
and then their mom dies, 1941.

568
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:09,032
Q, where are you going with this?

569
00:29:09,034 --> 00:29:11,923
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

570
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,597
but we do know
when they open--

571
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:15,934
every time the Chatwins go.

572
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,555
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

573
00:29:17,607 --> 00:29:19,726
then we could follow 'em in.

574
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:21,280
Uh...

575
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:25,239
Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

576
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:27,411
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

577
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,251
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

578
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:33,141
Wait, but that would put us
in past Fillory, right?

579
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:35,313
Fillory is magic.

580
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:37,987
Remember, Jane falls in that swamp,

581
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:39,776
and then she comes out
20 years later.

582
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,948
She strikes a deal
with the Watcherwoman

583
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,869
to send her back.

584
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:48,346
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

585
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:50,017
I have an idea,

586
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,638
something Richard told me,

587
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,311
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

588
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:56,066
Brakebills.

589
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:57,401
Okay.

590
00:29:57,453 --> 00:29:59,155
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

591
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:01,495
in order to get through the wards.

592
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,667
Alumni key.

593
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,224
Richard gave it to me.

594
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:08,730
This place is impossible.

595
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,517
How does anyone find anything?

596
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,107
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

597
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,780
What have you got?
Anything?

598
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:17,702
"The Book of
Mike McCormick."

599
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:19,707
Novella, really.

600
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:24,886
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

601
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,724
But the worst part?

602
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:28,779
His life was happy.

603
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:30,232
Eliot, he's gone.

604
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:31,987
Why are you torturing yourself?

605
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,411
Because he's gone and it's my fault.

606
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:37,133
And of all the people in the world

607
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,090
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

608
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:44,601
- What are you doing?
- Putting the past behind me.

609
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,941
No, stop!

610
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,276
Look, he's had a really bad week.

611
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:49,863
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

612
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,871
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

613
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:54,960
It's one book.

614
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:57,016
No, it's a life.

615
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:58,803
They're irreplaceable.

616
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:00,940
No, wait!

617
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:05,653
What did you do?

618
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,660
Let's go.

619
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:14,340
<i>"Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

620
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:18,267
"Bridge to
the Cretaceous period."

621
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,854
Oh, hey, here's one.

622
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:22,361
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

623
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,867
Voyage of the "Titanic."

624
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,587
Oh, fun.

625
00:31:26,622 --> 00:31:28,225
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

626
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,380
to one specific
point in time and--

627
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,217
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

628
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:35,392
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

629
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,648
All got used up by the '70s.

630
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,151
Wait a minute.

631
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:41,239
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

632
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:44,916
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

633
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:48,091
"Operation Die Fuehrer."

634
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:49,260
Guess no one told 'em Hitler was

635
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,764
a pretty serious battle Magician?

636
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:52,266
Yeah.

637
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:54,356
Uh, yep, and Hitler killed them.

638
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:55,859
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

639
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:59,618
Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

640
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,291
April 19th.

641
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:04,129
Yeah.

642
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:08,056
You remember the, uh--
yeah, "The Flying Forest."

643
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:10,395
Yeah, uh, Jane's going into town.

644
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:13,236
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

645
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:16,994
April 21, 1942.

646
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:19,000
Two days after this time bridge.

647
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:20,888
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

648
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:23,177
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

649
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:27,236
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

650
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:28,740
Yeah.

651
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:33,285
Earth fountain's blocked off.

652
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:34,537
I told you it would be.

653
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:35,757
It was worth a shot.

654
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,461
I mean, what else are we gonna do?

655
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:39,050
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

656
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:40,603
of the library in the first place?

657
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,774
All right, let's keep moving.

658
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:45,803
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

659
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:47,557
We're highly trained Earth magicians.

660
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:50,030
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from Brakebills?

661
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:52,987
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

662
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,159
Come with me if you want to live.

663
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:57,164
I've always wanted to say that.

664
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:02,728
But seriously, um, we should go.

665
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:09,170
Welcome to <i>chez</i> Hoberman.

666
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,920
You're welcome to whatever.

667
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:15,507
Just don't eat the carrots.

668
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,681
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

669
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,856
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

670
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,593
Holy shit.

671
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,281
This tastes like pizza.

672
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,785
Yeah, I know, right?

673
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,205
How long have you been down here?

674
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,709
A few weeks.

675
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,129
Just been camped out,

676
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:32,599
waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

677
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,718
Anyone else?

678
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,223
From my class.

679
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,061
Look, don't freak,
but back at Brakebills,

680
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:38,614
nobody knows what happened
to you guys.

681
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,237
And it's sort of been two years.

682
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,743
Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

683
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,248
Victoria warned me about that.

684
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,005
Victoria?
You know her?

685
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,978
She's the only reason I'm alive.

686
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:52,732
Look are you gonna tell us

687
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,521
what the fuck happened
to your class, or what?

688
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:55,606
Where'd you guys go?

689
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,860
To Fillory

690
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,666
for spring break.

691
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,370
V's amazing.

692
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:04,460
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

693
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,967
<i>Teachers put this tattoo
on her to stop her.</i>

694
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,854
She just cut it off herself.

695
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,225
- Joshy.
- What?

696
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:11,527
- You're not gonna believe it.
- What?

697
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,900
I did it.
I found Fillory.

698
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,487
- What?
- I found Fillory!

699
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,042
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo! We're going to Fillory!

700
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,579
- We're going to Fillory?
- Uh-huh!

701
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:20,334
<i>So we decided to plan a trip.</i>

702
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:22,172
<i>You know, party,
smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

703
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:24,058
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

704
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,565
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first year class,</i>

705
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,353
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

706
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:29,856
<i>Luckily, V was so good,</i>

707
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:31,778
<i>she was able to take them all with.</i>

708
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,916
<i>It was magical.</i>

709
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:36,206
<i>I mean, more magical</i>

710
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:37,792
<i>than Brakebills,</i>

711
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:41,051
<i>like going from black and white
to color.</i>

712
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:43,473
V and I had a threesome with a naiad.

713
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:47,149
This guy Donnie, he had sex
with a talking horse.

714
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:49,404
I mean, it's not exactly
taboo in Fillory

715
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,076
since the animals can give consent,

716
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:52,796
but we were all still
a bit squicked out.

717
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:55,085
We get it.
You fucked some animals.

718
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:58,427
How'd you end up here?

719
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,649
Got roped into this quest.

720
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:04,274
Ended up being a trap for Victoria.

721
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:07,449
This dude--Mothra,
I've been calling him--

722
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:08,785
Yeah, we know that clown.

723
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:10,875
It was a bloodbath.

724
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:13,013
V zapped me here,
and then she went back in.

725
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:14,300
Told me to stay put,

726
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:17,640
so I have just been waiting.

727
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,865
V should have been here by now.

728
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:25,209
He caught her.

729
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:26,412
But she's still alive.

730
00:35:26,464 --> 00:35:27,998
How do you know that?

731
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,391
I'm like her.
It's why I'm here.

732
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,846
We can all go, rescue Victoria.

733
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,066
You can take us.

734
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:38,108
I...

735
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,030
haven't exactly cracked

736
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:43,871
the whole ride-along yet.

737
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,291
Okay, forget traveling.

738
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,046
Uh, we'll just take a fountain.

739
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:50,270
Except we don't know
where the Fillory fountain is.

740
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:51,724
That's easy.

741
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:53,277
It's three squares up,
one square left.

742
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,733
The problem is all the
battle magic dick buckets

743
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:57,572
waiting to vaporize us.

744
00:35:57,624 --> 00:35:59,660
Discuss.

745
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:07,813
It's in the closet.

746
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,325
El and Margo made a door
to their favorite pub in London.

747
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,664
They look like fun.

748
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,167
Look, you were supposed to be here.

749
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:17,672
You were supposed
to be a part of this.

750
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:19,541
No, you know, I think Jane was right.

751
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,011
Had I been here living it up,

752
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,634
I would have never
felt the need to figure out

753
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:24,187
what magic is actually for.

754
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,559
Okay, so what's magic
actually for, then?

755
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,736
For fixing things, dummy.

756
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:33,494
Trust me.

757
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,081
I, uh, made a lot of mistakes

758
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:37,336
before I figured that one out.

759
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:40,678
Yeah, everything I've been
able to fix doesn't matter,

760
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,851
just minor mendings and bullshit.

761
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:46,407
Yeah, well, if fixing
big things were easy,

762
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,580
everyone would do it.

763
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,668
Come on.

764
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,882
Alice.

765
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:58,722
Get some sleep.

766
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:00,393
I know.

767
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:01,896
I might as well.

768
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:04,570
I'll never figure this out.

769
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:07,578
Trying to think of how to get us
all to the Fillory fountain

770
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,047
without getting us killed.

771
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,814
Need a hand?

772
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,323
Look, Penny,

773
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,279
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea, but--

774
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,619
Whoa, stop.

775
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:28,461
It was fun, okay?

776
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,853
You're one of the few people
I actually respect.

777
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:34,643
Uh, yeah, you're right, right.

778
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:36,648
I'm just making this weird, huh?

779
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,653
Eh, it's weird.

780
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:41,961
We're weird.
So what?

781
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:46,172
We're friends, right?

782
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,521
I just keep thinking about Quentin.

783
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,241
Look, I know.

784
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:56,078
I just keep thinking
how awful it would be

785
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:57,783
if, out of all of us, he was the one

786
00:37:57,835 --> 00:38:00,088
who didn't get to see Fillory.

787
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:03,129
And then I remember that I hate him.

788
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,051
Fuck, why am I such an idiot?

789
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:06,438
Okay.

790
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:10,231
Quentin is irrelevant.

791
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:13,237
Just another excuse
for that thing you always do.

792
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:14,292
What thing?

793
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:15,460
"I should just give up.

794
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:17,080
I'll never figure it out."

795
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,919
Shit got real.

796
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:20,840
If you're gonna drop that bullshit,

797
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:23,429
now's the time.

798
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:25,099
<i>Phosphoromancy.</i>

799
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,523
I can bend light around us,
all of us,

800
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:29,027
the whole group, I think,

801
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,831
make us invisible.

802
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:32,284
It'll be difficult with the two suns

803
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:33,840
but not impossible.

804
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,293
We'll have to move
in a pretty tight formation.

805
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:36,379
When should we leave?

806
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,631
As soon as possible.

807
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,185
The suns are just about in position.

808
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,391
It has begun!

809
00:38:41,443 --> 00:38:42,811
Sorry.

810
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,698
Penny, Eliot, you're both tall,

811
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,653
so you'll have to duck down
and stay close to me, okay?

812
00:38:46,705 --> 00:38:48,575
- Or they'll see you.
- Got it.

813
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,580
We got it, right?

814
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:54,924
Eliot, are you coming?

815
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,683
Right behind you, Bambi.

816
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:10,888
Let's do this.

817
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,892
Okay.

818
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,049
Holy shit.

819
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:27,428
Is that an air raid siren?

820
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,098
Okay.

821
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,521
1942.

822
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:32,942
We need to get out of here.

823
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:33,995
Yeah.

824
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:42,598
Go to the right.

825
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,461
Is everything all right, Eliot?

826
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:57,134
I'm amazing.

827
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,927
Go left. Go left.

828
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:23,065
Yeah, I brought a gun.

829
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:25,705
Thanks, Margo.

830
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,828
You're welcome.
Why didn't you move?

831
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,549
Acid carrots.

832
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:36,765
Margo, you saved my actual life.

833
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,605
Hooray, you live
to drink another day.

834
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:40,741
Oh, shit, guys, they see us.

835
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:43,031
Shit!
Go! Go!

836
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:20,789
Oh, my God.

837
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,961
She looks so young.

838
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:25,801
Yeah, she's got
no idea what's coming.

839
00:41:27,023 --> 00:41:28,141
Hey.

840
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:29,478
That's got to be it, right?

841
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,232
Across the street,
the door to Fillory?

842
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:32,486
Yeah.

843
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:33,989
Ooh, here she comes.

844
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:43,845
You ready, Janey?

845
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:47,522
Why, yes, Martin, I think I am.

846
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:12,801
Oh, my God.

847
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:16,977
Q, Q.

848
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:21,773
Look.
