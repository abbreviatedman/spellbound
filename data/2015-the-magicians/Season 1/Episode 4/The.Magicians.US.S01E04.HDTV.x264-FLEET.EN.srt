1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,395
<i>Previously on The Magicians.</i>

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:03,743
<i>Before I got here,</i>
<i>I was in the hospital.</i>

3
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,830
Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,771
Look, I've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else,

5
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:11,009
so you can't make me stay.

6
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,249
<i>Brakebills is the first place</i>
<i>that feels right to me</i>

7
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,953
<i>that is not</i>
<i>literally a fairy tale.</i>

8
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,030
Quentin!

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,564
I made the mistake of
thinking you were just psychic.

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:20,607
Do you know
how to close your mind?

11
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,558
'Cause I will
show you right now!

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,267
You are a traveler.

13
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:28,740
<i>You can actually move</i>
<i>between worlds.</i>

14
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,063
Where are you going, kitty cat?

15
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,756
I'm done here for good.

16
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,853
You should be happy--
less competition.

17
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,547
<i>Hedge witches: amateurs,</i>
<i>sad, and desperate people.</i>

18
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:44,800
- That means level 50.
- So you were--

19
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,386
Top witch in New York,
for starters.

20
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:50,577
Get me everything
on this list this week.

21
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,208
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you're doing here, Jules.</i>

22
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,781
<i>Magic wasn't just handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,112
People at Brakebills, Jules,
they can read minds.

24
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,564
They can fly.
You can do a party trick.

25
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,032
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,484
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

27
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,241
not knowing that
I was a magician.

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,039
I can't go back.

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,022
Fuck...

30
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,940
Dude, you're in the wrong--

31
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,027
or I'm in the wrong, uh...

32
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:44,336
Hey! Big stuff.

33
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,505
- Hey.
- Got 'em? I'm dying.

34
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,340
Where are they?
Where are they?

35
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,592
Oh, Jesus.

36
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,060
- Where are they?
- Cut it out.

37
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,646
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

38
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:58,517
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

39
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,853
Watercolors.

40
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,405
Without me, they're just--

41
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,943
Quentin, could I speak to you?

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,701
Quentin?

43
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,033
<i>Okay, this is obviously a dream</i>

44
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,455
where I realize I'm in a dream.

45
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,861
So you think your life
is a dream?

46
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
No, my life is my life,

47
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,542
but this is like a--

48
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,843
This is the bad collage.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,795
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

50
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,881
the Brakebills--
it's all jumbled together.

51
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,883
So we're back to Brakebills?

52
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,101
Hopefully soon.

53
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,886
Where you think you're a student

54
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,888
studying to be a magician?

55
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,357
Okay, let's just skip the part

56
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,643
where you don't believe me,
okay?

57
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,896
Um, yeah,
it's a little chilly in here.

58
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,732
How about a miniature sun?

59
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,067
That'd be great.

60
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:04,750
I hate these dreams.

61
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,302
It's like your feet
are stuck to the floor

62
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,553
or you're paralyzed.

63
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,305
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,757
You released me, remember,
in the real hospital?

65
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,559
I remember what I said.
What was it?

66
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,728
Uh, "You can't keep me here.

67
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,479
I haven't hurt myself
or anybody else."

68
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,731
You know that isn't true.

69
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,432
Well, none of this is true,

70
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:23,902
but I said that to you
in real life before Brakebills.

71
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:27,656
Send him in.

72
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,992
Quentin, do you remember why

73
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,077
the court ordered you
to be here?

74
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,614
The court? I don't...

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,866
If this is a trial dream,
I am--

76
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,119
God, these things take forever.

77
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:41,954
Come in, Penny.

78
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,707
Show me again what you found
in Quentin's trash.

79
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,353
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

80
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,344
No. Hey,
it's okay, Penny.

81
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,928
No one's in trouble.

82
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,971
Thank you, Penny.

83
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,310
Quentin,

84
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,029
this is what happens when you
don't take what we prescribe.

85
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,815
You start to hallucinate again
that you're a magician,

86
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:10,983
you have powers.

87
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,035
It's all here--

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,705
uh, the house of cards, Alice,

89
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:22,795
Eliot, Margo,
the Physical Kids, The Beast.

90
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,631
I know this can
all seem very real,

91
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,332
but it's not.

92
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,502
Brakebills is the hallucination.

93
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,338
This is the reality.

94
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,340
You're seeing this, right?

95
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,342
You're very, very sick.

96
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,847
Are you not seeing this?

97
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,983
Oh, Jesus.

98
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,572
I see you, Quentin,
and I'm very, very worried.

99
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:53,942
Oh, okay.
They're gone.

100
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:55,694
The moths, they're--

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,996
- They're gone.
- There are no moths, Quentin.

102
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,032
There never were.

103
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,786
Ah!

104
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,623
Oh, I can't breathe.

105
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,545
Code red! Code red!
Main office!

106
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:29,443
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

107
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,613
Don't let them see.

108
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,784
I heard they shot you up.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,487
I'm kind of foggy.

110
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,906
No, no, no.
Just focus on me, okay?

111
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:45,160
None of this is real.
Just us two.

112
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,995
And this.

113
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,300
Where are we?

114
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,669
I mean, what's going on?

115
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,421
You don't remember?

116
00:06:56,474 --> 00:07:00,259
I--I was at school,
I think, and...

117
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,144
And then I fell asleep
at a party,

118
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,148
and then I'm here

119
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,100
where none of that
ever happened, and--

120
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,268
No, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,352
- Oh, man.
- No.

122
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,105
You came to find me.

123
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,773
I did?

124
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,942
To save me.

125
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:20,279
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

126
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,864
The illusion?

127
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,909
I crash-landed on this planet
9.3 light-years ago.

128
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,667
- Alice?
- Wait.

129
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,036
You're a starship captain,
and you came to rescue me.

130
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,955
I--uh, no.
Hang on.

131
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,507
But none of this is real.
It's--

132
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:35,794
We're trapped in a cage,
a menagerie.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,462
Alice?

134
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,828
And they show us these illusions

135
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,299
to make us fall
in love and mate.

136
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,137
Alice, that's enough.

137
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,222
Give them back.

138
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,308
- What, Dr. Fogg?
- All of them, Alice.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,809
We need them for Bridge.

140
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,148
They collect us
from all over the galaxy

141
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,533
to feed off our emotions.

142
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:58,984
No, that's not true.

143
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,569
It's an episode
of "Lost in Space."

144
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,653
"Star Trek."

145
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:02,988
What?

146
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:04,434
That's an episode
of "Star Trek."

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,243
It's an episode
of "Star Trek."

148
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,212
They finally got to you.

149
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,832
You belong to them now.

150
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,083
It's okay.

151
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll still mate with you.

152
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,505
All right, that's enough.

153
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,341
- Me three!
- That's enough.

154
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,842
Me three.

155
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:32,184
Quentin, how are you?

156
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you feeling any better?

157
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,574
I guess.

158
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,075
Good.

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,079
Are you up for seeing a visitor?

160
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:50,118
Hey, Q.

161
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,876
I mean, Yale's still
kind of a letdown--

162
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,911
still, in the best way.

163
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,913
I mean, you would've--

164
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,584
Well, you--I mean, you will
totally agree, you know,

165
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,836
once, you know, it's you.

166
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,337
When what?
When I'm out?

167
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,173
It's just so much
easier than I--

168
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,758
than we expected, is all.

169
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:14,679
So you've been at Yale
these last few months,

170
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,265
and I've been here?

171
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't remember?

172
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,103
This? No.

173
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,239
Okay.

174
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:27,358
James is sorry
he couldn't make it tonight,

175
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,360
but he'll be by next week.

176
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,531
You know, we had
to lock down a church.

177
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,116
Church?

178
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,118
Mm-hmm.
For the wedding.

179
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,544
Are you engaged?

180
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,801
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

181
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,207
Seriously,
it doesn't even matter.

182
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,721
It's not important.

183
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,724
- It's a spell.
- A spell?

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,645
We're all trapped in it,
and I'm the only one who knows.

185
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,230
Okay, look.
I know that I just--

186
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,148
I sounded like Alice
just then, but I'll--

187
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:12,487
Hey, um, I swear I'm not crazy.

188
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,155
I want to understand, okay?

189
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,406
- I want to help you.
- No.

190
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,909
- Just tell me.
- No. No.

191
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:21,463
No. Okay, I can do this.

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,759
Oh, God, look.

193
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:37,762
Jules.

194
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:38,813
Jules, look.

195
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,431
Look.
Are you seeing this?

196
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,268
Look!

197
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,103
Are you guys--
are you not seeing this?

198
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,946
Okay.

199
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,451
- Don't...
- What?

200
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,127
- Look at me like that.
- Q--

201
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,289
Don't feel sorry for me.
Do not.

202
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm not me, and you're not you,
and this is not happening.

203
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,260
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

204
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,628
I'm not--I'm not here.

205
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,297
I am the one that
got into Brakebills.

206
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,349
- I'm in Brakebills!
- Hey, you!

207
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:17,135
Keep your voice down.

208
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,139
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, um...

209
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,690
Sorry.

210
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,634
Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?

211
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:34,055
Um, I'll be back Friday.

212
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:39,324
This can't be my life.

213
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,409
Jules, it can't be.

214
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,669
I wanted to see the fireworks.

215
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,638
I really did.

216
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,644
Wait.

217
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,513
How did you know
they were fireworks?

218
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,598
What?

219
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:04,849
If you couldn't see them,

220
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,568
how did you know
they were fireworks?

221
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,186
You told me.

222
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:12,190
I never said the word
"fireworks," Julia.

223
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,611
What's going on here?

224
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,534
Okay, did nobody see that?

225
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,171
- See what?
- You laughing at me.

226
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:30,541
Laughing at you?

227
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,344
What kind of a friend
would do that?

228
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,680
Exactly.

229
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,802
Good-bye, Quentin.

230
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,643
What?

231
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:58,724
All of them one by one.

232
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,843
Begin.

233
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,772
I believe you, Quentin.

234
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,909
You are a magician...

235
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,747
A very bad one.

236
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:27,119
One thing that's real:

237
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:30,372
you're always a raging dick.

238
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,353
Ellsworth Downs.

239
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,807
Ellsworth Downs.

240
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:51,226
Ellsworth Downs.

241
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,395
Ellsworth.

242
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,731
Ellsworth Downs.

243
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,071
You know.

244
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,242
You know where to look, Quentin.

245
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,211
I can't show you.

246
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:12,381
I can't touch you.

247
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,000
It's very strong, this spell.

248
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,135
It is?

249
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,753
It is a spell?

250
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,973
It's in the book,
but the book is you.

251
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,758
This is all you.

252
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,760
Me?

253
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,098
Uh, which book?

254
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,766
Jane?

255
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:33,736
I can't remember what,
uh--

256
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:37,072
Jane, they gave me pills,
and I can't--I can't remember.

257
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,825
Jane.

258
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,364
<i>Jane.</i>

259
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,208
No, No!

260
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,626
No, stop!
Stop it!

261
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:59,678
Stop! No!

262
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,380
The answer's in these books.

263
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:06,885
Jane said that these books are
my key to getting out of here.

264
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,722
Jesus.

265
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:12,357
Every time I talk,
I sound batshit.

266
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,118
Could I get some tape anyplace?

267
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,787
Tape isn't permitted.

268
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:27,823
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, I know.

269
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,408
But why, again?

270
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,327
'Cause you can harm
yourself or others.

271
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,796
It's tape.

272
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,664
That can strangle,
suffocate--

273
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:38,667
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

274
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,919
No one has that kind of time.

275
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,805
I need to put these pages
back together.

276
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,673
You need to get
to music therapy.

277
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:53,315
Music is a way for us
to express and receive feeling

278
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,401
in a way that is safe and fun

279
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,937
and sometimes illuminating.

280
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,272
So who'd like to begin?

281
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,741
Oh, God,
please not that one song.

282
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,159
Ah, I'm sorry.

283
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:07,029
What was that, Penny?

284
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:10,999
Oh, that one song, please, no.

285
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,418
It gets in my head,
and it never leaves.

286
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:14,787
Oh, which song is that?

287
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,256
"Michael Rowed
the Boat Ashore."

288
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,175
#Agree.

289
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,710
Everything here is me.

290
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,128
All right, everyone,

291
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,930
why don't we kick it off
with the Beatles?

292
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:27,883
"Helter Skelter."
Helter Skelter," please!

293
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,802

Hey, Penny, good luck
getting that out of your head.

326
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:51,848
<i>Doctor...</i>

327
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:57,628
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, Quentin.

328
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,589
Look, I think I know
what's going on here,

329
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,114
and I think I know
how to get help.

330
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,994
Well, help is why we're here.

331
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,614
No, it's not.

332
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,199
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're here

333
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,367
because of a spell, and I need
to break the spell.

334
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,701
Quentin--

335
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,703
And if I can just reach
Penny, the real Penny,

336
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,039
and if--if I can get
inside of his head--

337
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,290
Enough.

338
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,176
That's enough.

339
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,434
Can I please have some tape?

340
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:27,804
Do you remember the last time
you saw your father?

341
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,557
Dinner a few months ago.

342
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,724
Why?

343
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,867
Dad?

344
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:44,237
Hello, Curly Q.

345
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,823
I...

346
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,751
What happened to your face?

347
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:01,254
Did you run into a door or...

348
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,809
You did that, Quentin.

349
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,678
I--

350
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,066
Come on.

351
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,101
It's time you see something.

352
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,408
<i>Look, I'm telling you</i>
<i>it wasn't my dad.</i>

353
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,077
<i>It was The Beast.</i>

354
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,829
<i>I never even touched him!</i>
<i>I used battle magic,</i>

355
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,831
<i>the same magic that I'm gonna</i>
<i>use to get out of here.</i>

356
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,419
<i>Are you ready?</i>
<i>Come on. Come on!</i>

357
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,371
<i>What did you do to my powers?</i>

358
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,707
<i>I need my powers.</i>
<i>The Beast is here, okay?</i>

359
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,093
<i>He's coming for me.</i>
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

360
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:41,511
<i>He is coming to kill us.</i>

361
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,347
<i>You have got to give me</i>
<i>back my power!</i>

362
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,302
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

363
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,720
<i>Ahh!</i>

364
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,560
Do you remember that night?

365
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,446
Um...

366
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,649
Your father does.

367
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,151
Tell him, Ted.

368
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,569
He needs to hear it.

369
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:10,657
He needs to know the truth
why he's here.

370
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,376
We were having dinner
to celebrate

371
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:17,497
when you got into Yale, and...

372
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,165
in the middle of the restaurant,

373
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,501
you suddenly said
there were moths everywhere.

374
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:22,835
No.

375
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,837
And then you started
calling me The Beast.

376
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,756
Mm-mm.

377
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,675
You're lying.

378
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,343
And then you picked up a knife.

379
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,512
- Mm-mm. No.
- I tried to stop you.

380
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,848
I grabbed you.
I tried to stop you from...

381
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,184
What?
From--from what?

382
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,653
You tried to kill
your father, Quentin.

383
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,338
You need to stop fighting this
Quentin.

384
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:56,944
The more you believe in magic,
Brakebills, The Beast,

385
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:59,896
<i>the more harm you do.</i>

386
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:04,267
<i>Accept who you are</i>
<i>and what's put you here.</i>

387
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,795
That's how you get better,
Quentin.

388
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,291
<i>I promise.</i>

389
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,161
Hey, you, seriously, talk to me.

390
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:16,331
Are you fucking with me?

391
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,335
Dude.

392
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:24,006
Uh, um, look, this'll
all be over soon, okay?

393
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,508
Just try not
to get buried under it.

394
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,478
I'm gonna talk to someone.
Shit.

395
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,348

Yeah, that's right.

00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,377
I'm talking to you.

410
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,103
I told you, keep up
with that stupid song,

411
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,514
and I'd come right
into your brain and rip it out.

412
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,299
- No, no, no.
- Well, here I am.

413
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:10,052
By the way, this is the most
pathetic loser dream ever.

414
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,804
Stop, okay? Just stop.

415
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:13,722
Please stop. Stop.

416
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:17,025
Please be knowing that dinner
will be served in five minutes,

417
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:20,395
and today, we are to be
serving chicken curry,

418
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:24,199
which is, of course,
my favorite.

419
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:29,738
You racist motherfucker.

420
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:31,457
You're not real.

421
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:37,246
Yeah, how's that?
Real enough?

422
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:39,131
That hurt.

423
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:40,666
Do it again, harder.

424
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,751
What kind of sick shit
are you about, Coldwater?

425
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:43,752
Harder.

426
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:50,309
Ow.

427
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,896
Nobody here can see you.

428
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:57,015
Yeah, 'cause there's
no here, dumbass.

429
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,233
This is all in your head.

430
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,269
I'm in your head.

431
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:02,488
Now stop singing that song so I
can go the fuck back to sleep.

432
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:03,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

433
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,074
Oh, my God.
It worked.

434
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,276
I did that.
I called you.

435
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:08,994
I called you with the song.

436
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,029
- You called me?
- I'm in trouble.

437
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,749
Seriously, help me.

438
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:16,451
- What is today out there?
- Wednesday.

439
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:19,371
So I've only been gone
for a night.

440
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,039
Am I asleep there somewhere?

441
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,124
Man, I don't know
what you do at night,

442
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,342
and I don't want to know.

443
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,260
- Where are you?
- Trying to sleep.

444
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:26,378
This is not a dream.

445
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,880
It--it's a--

446
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,265
All of this, it's a spell.

447
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:34,853
Please, listen.
Find me, okay?

448
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,138
Out there, find me.

449
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,141
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

450
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,692
Okay, you have to wake up.

451
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:42,227
Wake up.

452
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:43,695
Wake up. Wake up.

453
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:44,897
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!

454
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,449
You, you will not be shouting.

455
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:48,984
End it now, buster.

456
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,369
Wake the hell up!

457
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,329
Okay.

458
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:02,998
Good job.

459
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,051
Wow.

460
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:10,339
My whole body, every part
of my body, is tingling.

461
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,890
I mean, you didn't tell me
it would feel--

462
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:14,092
So good?

463
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:18,180
It's high-end, designer
cooperative magic.

464
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:21,483
It does something to your cells
to channel all that juice.

465
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:23,986
Everyone gets stronger.

466
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:26,772
Um, I just, um...

467
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:32,077
I didn't think Q
would, uh, fall in so deep.

468
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:35,030
Oh, this is nothing.

469
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,033
Uh, what--
what does that mean?

470
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,998
Well, I mean he might want
to take his shoes off

471
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,286
and get comfortable.

472
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:42,871
We cooked up a whopper here.

473
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:45,090
I don't really see him
getting out of it,

474
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,959
even with your boyfriend's help.

475
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:54,266
Mm, I thought the idea
was to just mess with him.

476
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:58,186
My idea was to fuck him up hard,

477
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:02,274
and you loved it even harder.

478
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,776
Yeah, yeah, fuck him up,
not kill him.

479
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,194
Wait, what?
Kill him?

480
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,196
Oh, he's not gonna die.

481
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:12,034
He just might not actually
ever wake up.

482
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:13,952
Oh, my God.

483
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:16,238
Hey, you are not going
limp on me here.

484
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,741
This is game time, ladies.

485
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,877
You got the ball, Kady.

486
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:24,496
Don't drop it.

487
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:28,083
Now go put all that
sweet hotness to work.

488
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,316
Sorry.

489
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,282

Oh, God.

494
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,130
Okay.

God, why can't I remember?

518
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:46,791
Okay, look, I am, like,
100% sure I invented you,

00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,578
so if you could please
just disappear?

520
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,549
Look, it was a party.

521
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,502
He's probably sleeping it off
under something

Hey.

524
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,840
Where you been?

525
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,676
I had to run into the city.

526
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,310
What's up?

527
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,896
Your lover man here
thinks our little Q

528
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:10,431
got roofied last night.

529
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:11,649
Look, we covered the house.

530
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:13,234
Let's start checking the lab,

531
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,187
the libraries, or whatever.

532
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,739
I know where he is.

533
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:26,364
He crawled in here
and passed out around 1:00.

534
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:29,367
Anyway, I've seen weirder.

535
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,835
Come on.
Hey, wake up.

536
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,206
He's breathing.
That's something.

537
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,258
Let me try.

538
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,765
This is bad.

539
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,183
How bad?

540
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,101
"We need to tell the dean" bad.

541
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,445
Now what?

542
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,397
We wait.

543
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,786
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

544
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:06,537
I did.

545
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,706
Bigger, better magic.

546
00:29:08,742 --> 00:29:11,876
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

547
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,128
I guess I could tell you now.

548
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:15,413
No, I don't feel like it.

549
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:17,215
Later maybe?

550
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,134
Mm, how about never?
That's a growing possibility.

551
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:24,806
Hmm.

552
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,308
Yes, I thought so.

553
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,427
The spell is called
a Scarlatti Web.

554
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:30,678
We cannot break it.

555
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:32,180
No one can.

556
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:34,932
Wait, he's not
gonna wake up ever?

557
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:38,269
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

558
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,404
We need to summon a Matarese.

559
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,943
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

560
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:47,862
I was wrong.

561
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,620
No.
What are you--

562
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:56,954
Lower the wards please.

563
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:08,299
Very good. And now the South
wards.

564
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:15,473
Dean Fogg following
the playbook.

565
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,526
The only thing that can break
our spell on your ex-BFF

566
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:22,814
is a Matarese--evil bug spirit
of the underworld.

567
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,419
About the only way
one of those can get

568
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,951
into this sugary wonderland

569
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:29,620
<i>is to lower all the protective</i>
<i>wards and shields</i>

570
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:33,241
in the school, letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

571
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,831
Welcome back to Brakebills.

572
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,300
Let's go steal their shit.

573
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:55,847
Careful.

574
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:03,654
Good.

575
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,191
<i>Daemonium Matarese, ecce vocavi</i>

576
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,660
<i>te in carcere liberare mens est.</i>

577
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,413
<i>Imperio Scarlatti telem nobus.</i>

578
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:15,583
That's the answer?

579
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:17,335
It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

580
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,587
which should break him
out of the spell,

581
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,672
which should bring him back,
halfway.

582
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,708
Halfway?

583
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:26,711
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

584
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,679
The Matarese breaks you
out of the prison,

585
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:31,883
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

586
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:34,886
and it is a lot easier
with a guide.

587
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:36,804
Penny, are you ready?

588
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,636
Quentin?

589
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:14,926
Quentin!
Answer me!

590
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:18,396
The problem is
in your frontal lobe, Quentin.

591
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,899
Your emotions are
in complete control now,

592
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:26,320
overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

593
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:27,772
So this...

594
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,776
Is inserted into the eye socket.

595
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,411
No, no, no, no, no.

596
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,579
It's called
a transorbital lobotomy.

597
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,867
Dad.

598
00:32:39,953 --> 00:32:42,870
Dad. Dad.

599
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:44,672
No, no, no, no, no, no.

600
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,624
No, no, don't!

601
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:49,299
Dad, don't!

602
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,047
Dad!

603
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,747
No, please, don't.
I didn't mean to, I swear.

605
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,754
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, stop!

606
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:01,408
Stop talking.
Stop listening.

607
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:04,445
There are only three things
that are real: you, me, and...

608
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,987
That.

609
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:14,655
Get up.
There are no straps.

610
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,290
This is not a hospital.

611
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,458
You are not crazy.

612
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,077
You can make it disappear.

613
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,495
Do it!

614
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,977
Quentin?

615
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,182
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

616
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:42,567
Wait, you went here?

617
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:45,436
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

618
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:48,573
So, what, this is revenge?

619
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,024
When you're here for that long,

620
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,609
they can't just erase you.

621
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,277
They take you
into a special room

622
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:54,695
off the dean's office

623
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:57,665
and remove every memory
you make here.

624
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,005
Every single magical thing
you learned amputated,

625
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
but those memories are stored.

626
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:13,598
Normally there's a shield
on this door

627
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,716
a hundred magicians
couldn't break.

628
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,102
Now...

629
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,557
Keep a lookout.

630
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,893
Wait, what's going--

631
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:33,186
It isn't working.
What happened?

632
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,094
I don't know.
I went there.

633
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,381
I told him,
the Matarese did his thing,

634
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:40,992
and then everything went black.

635
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,814
Hey.

636
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:56,399
He's not gonna wake up...

637
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:57,400
ever.

638
00:34:57,485 --> 00:34:58,617
No, Marina
just has to--

639
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:02,154
Marina is a psycho.

640
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,324
You were his friend.

641
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:06,826
It's her spell.
I can't--

642
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,495
No, I didn't sign up for this shit.

643
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:13,833
No, you have to go
reverse it now.

644
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,716
Well, I can finally
reach you again,

645
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:06,469
but that's never been
the problem, has it--

646
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:07,849
my reaching you?

647
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,639
Will you please,
just for once--

648
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,775
no more riddles, okay?

649
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,727
Just tell me what to do.

650
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:17,279
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

651
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:18,731
You make the web you're in.

652
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:21,484
You're the spider and the fly,

653
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:23,235
just like...

654
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:32,661
Look, I can help.

655
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:34,213
I can give you the exact
wording of the spell.

656
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,664
It's too late.

657
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,299
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

658
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,300
Yeah, bullshit.
You did it to get even.

659
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,070
Oh, fuck you!
Somebody help him.

660
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,089
If I had the exact spell
wording one hour ago,--

661
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,474
There's got to be something.

662
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,726
You have any idea
where he is right now?

663
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,228
Why would you do this?

664
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,096
She didn't.

665
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:53,649
Not by herself.
Did you?

666
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,740
You sure you want to play?

667
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:09,532
No. I'm not sure of anything.

668
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:13,285
Except I'm tired, so tired.

669
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,704
Of?

670
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,840
Fighting all the time,

671
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:19,425
becoming someone that
I actually want to be,

672
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,628
and then realizing that I...

673
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,848
am nothing.

674
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,716
So you made the hospital,

675
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:31,186
conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

676
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,389
Of course you're exhausted.

677
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:37,359
And you can hide
from it all forever

678
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:41,146
in this lovely, quiet,
blank void.

679
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:43,482
But you also built a way out.

680
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:46,485
Otherwise,
why are he and I here?

681
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:56,545
"The Madness Maker didn't
play for the joy of winning,

682
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:59,164
"just the fear of losing.

683
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,884
"The real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

684
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:06,639
"which cut him off
from the surprise,

685
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:10,476
horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

686
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:18,150
"Jane saw only one way
out for him:

687
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,353
"stop playing.

688
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:24,356
Start living."

689
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:38,671
Hey.

690
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:39,788
Somebody woke up.

691
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,395
Took your damn time.

692
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:44,259
Somebody get him some brandy.

693
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:46,428
Flying in.

694
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,753
Wait.

695
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,255
Where's the hedge bitch?

696
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:56,975
Chop-chop.

697
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,309
They're going back up.

698
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,490
You should've told me your
friend wasn't properly erased.

699
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,243
I know.

700
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:14,947
And you and Eliot
never should've taken on

701
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:16,281
the hedge witches alone.

702
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,784
I know.

703
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,270
Quentin, do you really think
that the magic that we teach

704
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,178
means that you just get
to fly above right and wrong?

705
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:31,680
Magic does not solve problems.

706
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:33,892
It magnifies them.
I know that too.

707
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,434
Believe me.

708
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:38,552
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

709
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,438
I need to be taught magic

710
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:45,475
so that I can decide
what it is or isn't...

711
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:48,562
for me.

712
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,732
That was almost well put.

713
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,569
Good night, Quentin.

714
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,325
Oh, and Quentin...

715
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,579
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

716
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:11,585
Me too, actually.

717
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:20,844
Wow.

718
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,429
Wow.

719
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,352
I kind of can't believe
I ever thought I knew...

720
00:40:29,438 --> 00:40:32,572
anything.

721
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,608
I'd like to share now

722
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,612
some of it with some of you.

723
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:46,870
Ow!

724
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,679
Wait. Wait.

725
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:58,298
No. No.

726
00:40:58,383 --> 00:40:59,583
I didn't get you out of there

727
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:01,635
because you pulled one
over on me.

728
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,471
You and Kady bitched out,
but you'd talk.

729
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:08,642
She can't.

730
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:13,363
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

731
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:16,983
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

732
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:19,903
You don't know cut off.

733
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:22,322
But, baby...

734
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,460
<i>You will.</i>

735
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:31,184
