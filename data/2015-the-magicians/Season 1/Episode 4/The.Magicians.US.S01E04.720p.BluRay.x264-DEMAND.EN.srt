He's breathing.
That's something.

525
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,005
Let me try.

526
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,771
This is bad.

527
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,651
How bad?

528
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,290
"We need to
tell the dean" bad.

529
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,005

what all this is for?

533
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,403
I did. Bigger,
better magic.

534
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,890
Yeah, you just never
mentioned how.

535
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,004
I guess I could
tell you now.

536
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,684
No, I don't feel
like it. Later, maybe?

537
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,925
How about never? That's
a growing possibility.

538
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,521
Hmm.

Yes, I thought so.

540
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,241
The spell is called
the Scarlatti Web.

541
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,607
We cannot break it.
No one can.

542

Wait, he's not gonna
wake up ever?

543
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,806
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

544
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,523
We need to summon
the Matarese.

545
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,208
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

546
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,491
I was wrong.

547
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,127
No! What are you...

549

553
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,684
About the only way one of those can
get into this sugary wonderland

554
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,969
<i>is to lower all the protective
wards and shields in the school,</i>

555

anyone waltz right in.

It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

562
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,287
which should break
him out of this spell,

563
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,129
which should bring
him back, halfway.

564
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,646
Halfway?

565
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,361
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

566
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,124
The Matarese breaks
you out of the prison,

567
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,403
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

568
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,404
and it is a lot
easier with a guide.

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,683
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

702
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,881
Wow. (SIGHS)

703
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,531
WOW. (LAUGHING)

704
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,684
I kind of can't believe
lever thought I knew

705
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,250
anything. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,810
I'd like to share now, some
of it with some of you.

707
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,521
(SCREAMING)

708
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,921
(GASPING)

709
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,249
(GASPING)

710
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,329
Wait. Wait. No. No.

711
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,609
I didn't get you out of there
because you pulled one over on me.

712
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,570
You and Kady bitched
out, but you'd talk.

713
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,211
She can't. (CHUCKLES)

714
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,361
Oh, poor you and your taste of
honey worse than none at all.

715
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,364
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

716
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,407
You don't know "cut off."

717
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,891
But, baby...

718
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,971
(WHOOSHING)

719
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,250
<i>You Will.</i>
