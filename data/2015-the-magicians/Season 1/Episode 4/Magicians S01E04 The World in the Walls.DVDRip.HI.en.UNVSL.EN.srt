Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

When are you gonna
tell me what all this is for?

531
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,406
I did. Bigger, better magic.

532
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,877
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

533
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,977
I guess I could tell you now.

534
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,657
No, I don't feel like
it. Later, maybe?

535
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,921
How about never? That's
a growing possibility.

Yes, I thought so.

The spell is called
the Scarlatti Web.

539
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,602
We cannot break it. No one can.

540

gonna wake up ever?

541
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,810
I said "no one," not "nothing."

542
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,546
We need to summon the Matarese.

we were making progress.

544
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,486
I was wrong.

545
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,118
No! What are you...

00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,857

547
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,339
Very good. And
now the south wards.

The only thing that can break our
spell on your ex-BFF is a Matarese.

the underworld.

00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:28,654
About the only way one of those
can get into this sugary wonderland

552
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,959

wards and shields in the school,</i>

anyone waltz right in.

That's the answer?

It shorts out the
cerebral cortex,

560
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,309
which should break
him out of this spell,

561
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,144
which should bring
him back, halfway.

562
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,644
Halfway?

563
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,346
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

564
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,160
The Matarese breaks
you out of the prison,

565
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,386
but you have to get
yourself out of the desert,

566
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,394
and it is a lot
easier with a guide.

00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:48,946
(GASPING)

707
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,280
(GASPING)

708
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:59,381
Wait. Wait. No. No.

709
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,621
I didn't get you out of there
because you pulled one over on me.

710
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,593
You and Kady bitched
out, but you'd talk.

711
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,223
She can't. (CHUCKLES)

712
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:14,400
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

713
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,374
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

714
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,441
You don't know "cut off."

715
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,912
But, baby...

716
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:24,981
(WHOOSHING)

717
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,251
<i>You will.</i>
