1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,593
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,581
<i>Before I got here, I
was in the hospital.</i>

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,905
Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,295
Look, I've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,142
So you can't make me stay.

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,306
<i>Brakebills is the first
place that feels right to me</i>

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,782
<i>that is not
literally a fairy tale.</i>

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,909
Quentin!

9
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,181
I made the mistake of
thinking you were just psychic.

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,531
Do you know how
to close your mind?

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,148
'Cause I will show
you right now.

12
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,486
You are a Traveler.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,462
<i>You can actually
move between worlds.</i>

14
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,463
Where you going, kitty cat?

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,762
I'm done here. For good. You
should be happy. Less competition.

16
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:42,173
<i>Hedge witches, amateurs,
sad and desperate people.</i>

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,471
That means level 50.

18
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,740
So you were...

19
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,747
Top bitch in New
York, for starters.

20
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,946
Get me everything
on this list, this week.

21
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,162
<i>I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.</i>

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,664
<i>Magic wasn't just handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,657
People at Brakebills,
Jules, they can read minds.

24
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,192
They can fly. You
can do a party trick.

25
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,750
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,387
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

27
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,522
not knowing that
I was a Magician.

28
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,759
I can't go back.

29
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,789
Oh...

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,268
Dude, you're in the
wrong... Or I'm in the wrong...

31
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,771
Uh...

32
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,662
Hey!

33
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,556
Big stuff. Hey.

34
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,067
You got them? I'm
dying. Where are they?

35
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,159
Where are they?

36
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,236
Jesus!

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,601
Where are they? Cut it out!

38
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,868
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

39
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,612
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

40
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,678
Watercolors. Without
me, they're adrift.

41
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,619
Quentin, could I speak to you?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,492
Quentin?

43
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,828
<i>Okay, this is obviously a dream</i>

44
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,161
where I realize I'm in a dream.

45
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,577
So you think your
life is a dream?

46
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,868
No, my life is my life, but this
is like a... This is a bad collage.

47
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,874
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

48
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,773
the Brakebills, it's
all jumbled together.

49
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,505
So we're back to Brakebills.

50
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,841
Hopefully, soon.

51
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,677
Where you think you're a student

52
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,512
studying to be a Magician.

53
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,012
Okay, let's just skip the part

54
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,248
where you don't
believe me, okay?

55
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,321
Um...

56
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,754
Yeah, it's a little
chilly in here.

57
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,089
How about a miniature sun?

58
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,655
That'd be great.

59
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,504
I hate these dreams.

60
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,276
It's like your feet are stuck to
the floor, or you're paralyzed.

61
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,908
Wait, wait, wait.
You released me.

62
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,509
Remember, in the real hospital?

63
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,055
I remember what I
said. What was it? Uh...

64
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,223
"You can't keep me here. I
haven't hurt myself or anybody else."

65
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,520
You know that isn't true.

66
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,720
Well, none of this is true,

67
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,558
but I said that to you

68
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,394
in real life before Brakebills.

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,728
Send him in.

70
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,797
Quentin, do you remember why
the court ordered you to be here?

71
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,774
The court? I don't...

72
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,173
If this is a trial
dream, I am...

73
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,146
God, these things take forever.

74
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,280
Come in, Penny.

75
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,116
Show me again what you
found in Quentin's trash.

76
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,078
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

77
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,124
No, it's okay, Penny.
No one's in trouble.

78
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,823
Thank you, Penny.

79
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,436
Quentin, this is what happens

80
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,997
when you don't take
what we prescribe.

81
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,633
You start to hallucinate again

82
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,008
that you're a Magician,
you have powers.

83
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,603
It's all here.

84
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Uh...

85
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,347
The house of cards,
Alice, Eliot, Margo,

86
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,355
the Physical Kids, The Beast.

87
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,692
I know this can all seem
very real, but it's not.

88
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,890
Brakebills is the hallucination.

89
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,200
This is the reality.

90
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,202
You're seeing this, right?

91
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,101
You're very, very sick.

92
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,435
Are you not seeing this?

93
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,138
Oh, Jesus!

94
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,485
I see you, Quentin, and
I'm very, very worried.

95
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:56,455
Oh, okay, they're gone.
The moths, they're...

96
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,547
They're gone.

97
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,219
There are no moths,
Quentin. There never were.

98
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,991
Ah!

99
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,262
Oh, I can't breathe!

100
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,467
Code red! Code red! Main office!

101
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,889
Don't let them see.

102
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,724
I heard they shot you up.

103
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,822
I'm kind of foggy.

104
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,564
No, no, no. Just
focus on me. Okay?

105
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,968
None of this is
real. Just us two.

106
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,864
And this.

107
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,677
Where are we?

108
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,213
I mean, what's going on?

109
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,647
You don't remember?

110
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,648
I was at school, I think, and...

111
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,947
And then I fell
asleep at a party,

112
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,354
and then I'm here.

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,758
Where none of that
ever happened, and...

114
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,194
No, no, no, no, no, no.

115
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,255
Oh, man! You came to find me.

116
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,659
I did?

117
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,736
To save me.

118
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,564
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

119
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,831
"The illusion"?

120
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,309
I crash-landed on this
planet 9.3 light years ago.

121
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,868
Alice? Wait.

122
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,107
You're a starship captain,

123
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,773
and you came to rescue me.

124
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,441
I, uh... No. Hang on.

125
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,179
But none of
this is real. It's...

126
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,619
We're trapped in a cage,

127
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,213
a menagerie.

128
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,483
Alice?

129
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,571
And they show us these illusions

130
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,219
to make us fall
in love and mate.

131
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,954
Alice, that's enough.

132
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,327
Give them back.

133
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,161
What, Dr. Fogg?

134
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,466
All of them, Alice. We
need them for bridge.

135
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,105
They collect us from all over the
galaxy to feed off our emotions.

136
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,307
No, that's not true. It's an
episode of <i>Lost in Space.</i>

137
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,213
<i>Star Trek.</i> What?

138
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,078
That's an episode of <i>Star Trek.</i>

139
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,086
It's an episode of <i>Star Trek.</i>

140
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,082
They finally got to you.
You belong to them now.

141
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,028
It's okay. I'll still
mate with you.

142
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,559
All right, that's enough.

143
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,633
Me, three!

144
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,725
That's enough.

145
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,193
Me, three.

146
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,841
Quentin, how are you?

147
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,641
Are you feeling any better?

148
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,515
I guess.

149
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:44,182
Good. Are you up
for seeing a visitor?

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,791
Hey, Q.

151
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,528
I mean, Yale's still kind of a
letdown. Still, in the best way.

152
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,802
I mean, you
would've... Well, you...

153
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,005
I mean, you will totally agree,
you know, once, you know, it's you.

154
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,012
When what? When I'm out?

155
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,710
It's just so much easier than
I... Than we expected, is all.

156
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,481
So you've been at Yale
these last few months...

157
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,822
And I've been here?

158
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,549
You don't remember?

159
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,060
This? No.

160
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,957
Okay.

161
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,429
James is sorry he
couldn't make it tonight,

162
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,163
but he'll be by next week.

163
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,364
You know, he had
to lock down a church.

164
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,235
Church?

165
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,944
Mmm-hmm. For the wedding.

166
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,876
Are you engaged?

167
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,347
It's okay.

168
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,551
No, it's not okay.

169
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,059
Seriously, it doesn't even
matter. It's not important.

170
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,126
It's a spell.

171
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,792
"A spell"?

172
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:01,891
We're all trapped in it,

173
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,369
and I'm the only one who knows.

174
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,269
Okay, look. I
know that I just...

175
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,899
I sounded like Alice
just then, but I...

176
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,941
Hey.

177
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,308
Um, I swear, I'm not crazy.

178
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,112
I want to understand, okay?

179
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,547
I want to help, Q.

180
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,948
Just tell me. No, no, no.

181
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,652
No. Okay, I can do this.

182
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,959
Oh, God, look!

183
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,571
Jules.

184
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,233
Jules, look. Look.
Are you seeing this?

185
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,534
Look!

186
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,446
You guys, are you
not seeing this?

187
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,153
Don't. What?

188
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,523
Look at me like that.

189
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,565
Q. Don't feel sorry
for me. Do not.

190
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,327
I'm not me, and you're not you,

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,369
and this is not happening.

192
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,713
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

193
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,707
I'm not... I'm not here. I am
the one that got into Brakebills.

194
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,901
- I'm in Brakebills!
- Hey, you!

195
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,677
Keep your voice down.

196
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,038
I'm sorry. It's my fault. Um...

197
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,875
Sorry.

198
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,986
I'm gonna go, okay?
I'll be back Friday.

199
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,595
This can't be my life.

200
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,430
Jules, it can't.

201
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,571
I wanted to see the fireworks.

202
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,472
I really did.

203
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,012
Wait.

204
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,780
How did you know
they were fireworks?

205
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,624
What? If you couldn't see them,

206
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,593
how did you know
they were fireworks?

207
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,555
You told me.

208
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,120
I never said the word

209
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,428
"fireworks," Julia.

210
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,568
What's going on here?

211
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,510
Okay, did nobody see that?

212
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,404
See what?

213
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,640
You laughing at me.

214
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,208
Laughing at you?

215
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,949
What kind of a
friend would do that?

216
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,520
Exactly.

217
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,989
Goodbye, Quentin.

218
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,429
What...

219
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,407
All of them, one by one.

220
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,046
Begin.

221
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,724
I believe you, Quentin.

222
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,062
You are a Magician.

223
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,633
A very bad one.

224
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:30,474
One thing that's real.
You're always a raging dick.

225
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,853
Ellsworth Downs.

226
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,289
Ellsworth Downs.

227
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,430
Ellsworth.

228
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,893
Ellsworth Downs.

229
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,973
You know.

230
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,870
You know where to look, Quentin.

231
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,174
I can't show you.
I can't touch you.

232
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,284
It's very strong, this spell.

233
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,248
It is... It is a spell?

234
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:23,228
It's in the book, the book
is you. This is all you.

235
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,756
Me?

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,366
Uh, which book?

237
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,169
Jane?

238
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,705
Uh, I can't remember what, uh...

239
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,869
Jane, they gave me
pills, and I can't remember.

240
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,037
Jane!

241
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,777
<i>Jane!</i>

242
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,427
No, no, no! Stop! Stop it! Stop!

243
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,428
No! The answer's in these books.

244
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,130
Jane said that...

245
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,297
These books are my
key to getting out of here.

246
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,935
Jesus.

247
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,045
Every time I talk,
I sound batshit.

248
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,318
Could I get some tape any place?

249
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,052
Tape isn't permitted.

250
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,390
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, I know.

251
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,594
But why, again?

252
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,356
'Cause you can harm
yourself or others.

253
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,696
It's tape.

254
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,861
That can strangle, suffocate...

255
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,633
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

256
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,333
No one has that kind of time.

257
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,875
I need to put these
pages back together.

258
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,741
You need to get
to music therapy.

259
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,581
Music is a way for us to
express and receive feeling

260
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,624
in a way that is safe and fun

261
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,283
and sometimes illuminating.

262
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,424
So, who'd like to begin?

263
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,360
Oh, God, please
not that one song.

264
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,595
Ah, I'm sorry. What
was that, Penny?

265
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,933
Oh, that one song?

266
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,371
Please, no. It gets in my
head, and it never leaves.

267
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,972
Oh, which song is that?

268
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,704
<i>Michael Row the Boat Ashore.</i>

269
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,106
#Agree.

270
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,913
Everything here is me.

271
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,059
All right, everyone,

272
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,745
why don't we kick it
off with the Beatles?

273
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,686
<i>Helter Skelter!
Helter Skelter,</i> please!

274
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,746
I was thinking <i>Here Comes the...</i>

275
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,122
<i>I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain</i>

276
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:42,836
<i>That's what people say
That's what people say</i>

277
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:47,566
<i>I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay</i>

278
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:53,810
<i>At least that's what people
say That's what people say</i>

279
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,008
<i>But I keep cruising</i>

280
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,984
<i>Can't stop, won't stop moving</i>

281
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:05,321
<i>It's like I got this music in my
mind saying it's gonna be all right</i>

282
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,870
<i>'Cause the players gonna
play, play, play, play, play</i>

283
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,404
He's doing this because
I made him take his pills!

284
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,106
<i>And the haters gonna
hate, hate, hate, hate, hate</i>

285
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,621
No! Dr. London!

286
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,224
<i>Baby, I'm just gonna shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake</i>

287
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,361
<i>Shake it off Shake it off</i>

288
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:22,272
<i>I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet</i>

289
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:28,972
<i>And that's what they don't
see That's what they don't see</i>

290
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,452
<i>I'm dancing on my own I
make the moves up as I go</i>

291
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:40,959
<i>And that's what they don't
know That's what they don't know</i>

292
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,927
Hey, Penny. Good luck
getting that out of your head.

293
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,135
<i>PTSD specialist
to ward room two.</i>

294
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,609
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, Quentin.

295
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,340
Look, I think I know
what's going on here,

296
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,006
and I think I know
how to get help.

297
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,549
Well, help is why we're here.

298
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,016
No, it's not.

299
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,747
I don't mean to be rude, but
you're here because of a spell,

300
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,186
and I need to break the spell.

301
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,087
Quentin. And if I
can just reach Penny,

302
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,786
the real Penny, and if I
can get inside of his head...

303
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,883
Enough.

304
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,020
That's enough.

305
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,094
Can I please have some tape?

306
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,799
Do you remember the last
time you saw your father?

307
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,440
Dinner a few months ago. Why?

308
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,611
Dad?

309
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,782
Hello, Curly Q.

310
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,937
What happened to your face?

311
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,663
Did you run into a door?

312
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,403
You did that, Quentin.

313
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,446
Come on.

314
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,482
It's time you see something.

315
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,892
<i>Look, I'm telling you, it wasn't
my dad. It was The Beast.</i>

316
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,065
<i>I never even touched
him! I used battle magic,</i>

317
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,012
<i>the same magic that I'm
gonna use to get out of here.</i>

318
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,232
<i>Are you ready? Come on. Come on!</i>

319
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,540
<i>What did you do to my powers?</i>

320
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,771
<i>I need my powers.
The Beast is here, okay?</i>

321
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,474
<i>He's coming for me. He's coming
for you. He is coming to kill us.</i>

322
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,143
<i>You have got to give
me back my power!</i>

323
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,585
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

324
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,189
<i>Ahh!</i>

325
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,824
Do you remember that night?

326
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,631
Um...

327
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,733
Your father does.

328
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,336
Tell him, Ted.

329
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:10,433
He needs to hear it. He needs
to know the truth why he's here.

330
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:16,175
We were having dinner to celebrate
when you got into Yale, and...

331
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,908
In the middle of the restaurant,

332
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,420
you suddenly said there
were moths everywhere.

333
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,512
No.

334
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,922
And then you started
calling me "The Beast."

335
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,092
Mmm-mmm.

336
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,059
You're lying.

337
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,221
And then you picked up a knife.

338
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,532
Mmm-mmm. No.
I tried to stop you.

339
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,068
I grabbed you. I tried
to stop you from...

340
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,661
What? From what?

341
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,530
You tried to kill
your father, Quentin.

342
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,544
You need to stop
fighting this, Quentin.

343
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,718
The more you believe
in magic, Brakebills,

344
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,554
<i>The Beast, the more harm you do.</i>

345
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,927
<i>Accept who you are
and what's put you here.</i>

346
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,262
That's how you get
better, Quentin. I promise.

347
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:16,007
Hey, Q, seriously, talk to
me. Are you fucking with me?

348
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,773
Dude.

349
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,015
Uh, um...

350
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,523
Look, this'll all be
over soon, okay?

351
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,679
Just try not to
get buried under it.

352
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,746
I'm gonna talk to someone. Shit.

353
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,721
<i>Play, play, play, play</i>

354
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,196
<i>Heartbreakers gonna break,
break, break, break, break</i>

355
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,530
<i>Players gonna play,
play, play, play, play</i>

356
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,263
<i>Shake it off Shake it off</i>

357
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,532
<i>Players gonna play,
play, play, play, play</i> Hey!

358
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,339
Quit singing that stupid song!

359
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,237
<i>Play, play, play</i>

360
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,469
Damn it.

361
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,203
Quentin!

362
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,278
Oh, no.

363
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,686
Yeah, that's right.
I'm talking to you.

364
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,396
I told you, keep up
with that stupid song,

365
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,169
and I'd come right into
your brain and rip it out.

366
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,593
No, no, no. Here I am.

367
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,358
By the way, this is the most
pathetic loser dream ever.

368
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,662
Stop, okay? Just
stop. Please stop. Stop.

369
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,931
Please be knowing that dinner
will be served in five minutes,

370
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,363
and today, we are to
be serving chicken curry,

371
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,107
which is, of
course, my favorite.

372
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,811
You racist motherfucker.

373
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,550
You're not real.

374
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,520
Yeah, how's that? Real enough?

375
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,961
That hurt. Do it again, harder.

376
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,053
What kind of sick shit
are you about, Coldwater?

377
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,153
Harder.

378
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,269
Ow.

379
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,164
Nobody here can see you.

380
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,938
Yeah, 'cause there's
no "here," dumbass.

381
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,313
This is all in your
head. I'm in your head.

382
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,825
Now stop singing that song, so
I can go the fuck back to sleep.

383
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,115
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Oh, my God. It worked.

384
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,287
I did that. I called you. I
called you with the song.

385
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,415
You called me?

386
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,890
I'm in trouble.
Seriously, help me.

387
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,562
What is today out there?

388
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,629
Wednesday.

389
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,759
So I've only been
gone for a night.

390
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,063
Am I asleep there somewhere?

391
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,446
I don't know what you do at
night, and I don't want to know.

392
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,563
Where are you?

393
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,662
Trying to sleep.

394
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,208
This is not a dream. It's a...

395
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,244
All of this, it's a spell.

396
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:37,573
Please, listen. Find me,
okay? Out there, find me.

397
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,983
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

398
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,082
Okay, you have to wake up.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

399
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,352
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

400
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,260
You, you will not be
shouting! End it now, buster.

401
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,059
Wake the hell up!

402
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,199
Okay. Good job.

403
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,211
Wow.

404
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:11,612
My whole body, every
part of my body is tingling.

405
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,094
I mean, you didn't
tell me it would...

406
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,586
Feel so good?

407
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,515
It's high-end designer
cooperative magic.

408
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,126
It does something to your cells

409
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,752
to channel all that juice.

410
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,729
Everyone gets stronger.

411
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,331
Um...

412
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,227
I just, um...

413
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,761
I didn't think Q
would fall in so deep.

414
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,471
This is nothing.

415
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,274
Uh, what does that mean?

416
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,813
Well, I mean he might want to take
his shoes off and get comfortable.

417
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,179
We cooked up a whopper here.

418
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,275
I don't really see
him getting out of it,

419
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,321
even with your boyfriend's help.

420
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,188
Mmm, I thought the idea was

421
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,887
to just mess with him.

422
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,659
My idea was to
fuck him up, hard,

423
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,223
and you loved it even harder.

424
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,165
Yeah, fuck him up, not kill him.

425
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,729
Wait, what? Kill him?

426
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:13,040
He's not gonna die. He just
might not actually ever wake up.

427
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,241
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,918
Hey, you are not going limp on
me here. This is game time, ladies.

429
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,716
You got the ball,
Kady. Don't drop it.

430
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,458
Now go put all that
sweet hotness to work.

431
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,038
Sorry.

432
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,668
Ellsworth.

433
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,272
Ellsworth Downs. Ellsworth...

434
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,347
Downs. Ellis...

435
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:29,412
Wirth-Downs, Ellis Wirth-Downs.
The Madness Maker.

436
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,151
Oh, God. Okay.

437
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,292
"In all of Fillory, one Magician

438
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,828
"could drive every
other Magician insane.

puzzles with no solution</i>

<i>"and games where the
rules changed for no reason.</i>

441
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,166
"He was called the
Madness Maker,

00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,607
"but he had been

<i>"Because the more Ellis played,

451

"But soon, Jane figured
out how to break this curse."

452
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,807
Thank you, Jane Chatwin.

453
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,935
"The Madness Maker's
curse was, uh..."

454
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,920
It's okay. It's okay. I know
this. I know this. I know this.

455
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:36,882
What did Jane say?

456
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,552
God, why can't I remember?

457
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:48,322
Okay, look, I am, like,
100% sure I invented you,

458
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,393
so if you could
please just disappear?

459
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,973
Look, it was a party.

460
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,109
He's probably
sleeping it off under

461
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,171
something or someone
or someone's thing.

462
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,339
Where you been?

463
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,884
I had to run into the city.

464
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,483
What's up?

465
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,920
Your lover man here thinks
our little Q got roofied last night.

466
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,481
Look, we covered the house.

467
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,358
Let's start checking the
lab, the libraries, whatever.

468
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,897
I know where he is.

469
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,838
He crawled in here and
passed out around 1:00.

470
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,875
Anyway, I've seen weirder.

471
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,343
Come on.

472
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,380
He's breathing.
That's something.

473
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,016
Let me try.

474
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,755
This is bad.

475
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,656
How bad?

476
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,250
"We need to tell the dean" bad.

477
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,002
Now what?

478
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,334
We wait.

479
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,271
When are you gonna
tell me what all this is for?

480
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,406
I did. Bigger, better magic.

481
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,877
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

482
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,977
I guess I could tell you now.

483
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,657
No, I don't feel like
it. Later, maybe?

484
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,921
How about never? That's
a growing possibility.

485
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,529
Hmm.

486
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,193
Yes, I thought so.

487
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,234
The spell is called
the Scarlatti Web.

488
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,602
We cannot break it. No one can.

489
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,208
Wait, he's not
gonna wake up ever?

490
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,810
I said "no one," not "nothing."

491
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,546
We need to summon the Matarese.

492
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,215
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

493
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,486
I was wrong.

494
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,118
No! What are you...

495
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,857
<i>Lower the wards, please.</i>

496
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,339
Very good. And
now the south wards.

497
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,940
Dean Fogg following
the playbook.

498
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,217
The only thing that can break our
spell on your ex-BFF is a Matarese.

499
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,154
Evil bug spirit of
the underworld.

500
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:28,654
About the only way one of those
can get into this sugary wonderland

501
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,959
<i>is to lower all the protective
wards and shields in the school,</i>

502
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,161
letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

503
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,430
Welcome back to Brakebills.

504
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,031
Let's go steal their shit.

505
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,450
Careful.

506
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,635
That's the answer?

507
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,940
It shorts out the
cerebral cortex,

508
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,309
which should break
him out of this spell,

509
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,144
which should bring
him back, halfway.

510
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,644
Halfway?

511
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,346
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

512
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,160
The Matarese breaks
you out of the prison,

513
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,386
but you have to get
yourself out of the desert,

514
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,394
and it is a lot
easier with a guide.

515
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,259
Penny, are you ready?

516
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,992
Quentin?

517
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,661
Quentin! Answer me!

518
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,529
The problem is in your
frontal lobe, Quentin.

519
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,238
Your emotions are in
complete control now,

520
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,470
overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

521
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,903
So this...

522
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,616
Is inserted into the eye socket.

523
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,880
No, no, no.

524
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,422
It's called a
transorbital lobotomy.

525
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,659
Dad!

526
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,058
Dad. Daddy.

527
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,289
No, no, no! Don't!

528
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,266
Dad, please, don't!

529
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,494
Daddy!

530
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,302
No, no, no! Please, don't.

531
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,637
I didn't mean to, I swear!

532
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,143
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,579
Stop! Stop talking.
Stop listening.

534
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,084
There are only three things
that are real. You, me, and...

535
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,785
That.

536
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,621
Get up. There are no straps.

537
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,289
This is not a hospital.
You are not crazy.

538
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,922
You can make it disappear.

539
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,393
Do it!

540
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,976
Quentin?

541
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,946
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

542
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,283
Wait, you went here?

543
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,821
Kicked out three
months before graduation.

544
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,425
So, what, this is revenge?

545
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,692
When you're here for that
long, they can't just erase you.

546
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,734
They take you into a special
room off the dean's office

547
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,065
and remove every
memory you make here.

548
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:03,300
Every single magical thing
you learned, amputated,

549
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,004
but those memories are stored.

550
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:16,546
Normally, there's a shield on this
door 100 Magicians couldn't break.

551
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,782
Now...

552
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,392
Keep a lookout.

553
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,594
Wait, what's going...

554
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,700
It isn't working.

555
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,003
I don't know. I went
there. I told him.

556
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,340
The Matarese did
its thing, and then

557
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,879
everything went black.

558
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,424
He's not gonna wake up. Ever.

559
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,489
No, Marina just has
to... Marina is a psycho!

560
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,661
You were his friend.

561
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,867
It's her spell. I can't...

562
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,498
No, I didn't sign
up for this shit.

563
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,935
No, you have to
go reverse it. Now.

564
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,462
Well, I can finally
reach you again.

565
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,358
But that's never been
the problem, has it?

566
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,730
My reaching you.

567
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,099
Will you please,
just for once...

568
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,398
No more riddles, okay?
Just tell me what to do.

569
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,036
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

570
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,905
You make the web you're in.

571
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:23,608
You're the spider
and the fly, just like...

572
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,085
Look, I can help. I can give
you the exact wording of the spell.

573
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,693
It's too late.

574
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,072
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

575
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,588
Yeah, bullshit. You
did it to get even.

576
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,156
Fuck you! Somebody help him.

577
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,226
If I had the exact spell
wording one hour ago...

578
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,498
There's got to be something.

579
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,411
You have any idea
where he is right now?

580
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,171
Why would you do this?

581
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,607
She didn't.

582
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,604
Not by herself. Did you?

583
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,721
You sure you want to play?

584
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,651
No, I'm not sure of anything.

585
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,860
Except I'm tired... So tired.

586
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,458
Of?

587
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,394
Fighting all the time.

588
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,704
Becoming someone
that I actually want to be,

589
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,934
and then realizing that I...

590
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,304
Am nothing.

591
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,944
So you made the hospital,

592
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,983
conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

593
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,876
Of course, you're exhausted.

594
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:38,355
And you can hide
from it all, forever,

595
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,257
in this lovely,
quiet, blank void.

596
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,593
But you also built a way out.

597
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,927
Otherwise, why
are he and I here?

598
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,598
"The Madness Maker didn't play

599
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,871
"for the joy of winning,
just the fear of losing.

600
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,146
"The real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

601
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:07,174
"which cut him off
from the surprise,

602
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,481
"horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

603
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,488
Jane saw only
one way out for him.

604
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,755
Stop playing.

605
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,225
Start living.

606
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,379
Somebody woke up.

607
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,114
Took your damn time.

608
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,415
Somebody get him some brandy.

609
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,357
Flying in.

610
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,789
Wait.

611
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,194
Where's the hedge bitch?

612
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,065
Chop chop. They're
going back up.

613
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,158
You should've told
me that your friend

614
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,775
wasn't properly erased.

615
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,577
I know.

616
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,451
And you and Eliot never should've
taken on the hedge witches alone.

617
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,785
I know.

618
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,184
Quentin, do you really think

619
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,162
that the magic that we teach

620
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,258
means that you just get to
fly above right and wrong?

621
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,103
Magic does not solve problems...

622
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,697
It magnifies them. I
know that, too. Believe me.

623
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,537
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

624
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,171
I need to be taught magic,

625
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,978
so that I can decide
what it is or isn't.

626
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,446
For me.

627
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:52,720
That was almost well put.

628
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,060
Good night, Quentin.

629
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,999
Oh, and Quentin,

630
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,833
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

631
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,700
Me, too, actually.

632
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,912
Wow.

633
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,519
Wow.

634
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:30,722
I kind of can't believe
I ever thought I knew

635
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,263
anything.

636
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:38,835
I'd like to share now,
some of it with some of you.

637
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:59,381
Wait. Wait. No. No.

638
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,621
I didn't get you out of there
because you pulled one over on me.

639
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,593
You and Kady bitched
out, but you'd talk.

640
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,223
She can't.

641
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:14,400
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

642
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,374
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

643
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,441
You don't know "cut off."

644
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,912
But, baby...

645
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,251
<i>You will.</i>
