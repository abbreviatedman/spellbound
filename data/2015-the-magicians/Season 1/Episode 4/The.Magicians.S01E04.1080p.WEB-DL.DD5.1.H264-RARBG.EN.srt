1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,618
<i>Previously on The Magicians.</i>

2
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:04,239
<i>Before I got here,
I was in the hospital.</i>

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,568
Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,936
Look, I've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else,

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,805
so you can't make me stay.

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,983
<i>Brakebills is the first place
that feels right to me</i>

7
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:17,582
<i>that is not
literally a fairy tale.</i>

8
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,115
Quentin!

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,750
I made the mistake of
thinking you were just psychic.

10
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,755
Do you know
how to close your mind?

11
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,287
'Cause I will
show you right now!

12
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,991
You are a traveler.

13
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>You can actually move
between worlds.</i>

14
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,826
Where are you going, kitty cat?

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,165
I'm done here for good.

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,100
You should be happy...
less competition.

17
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:42,735
<i>Hedge witches: amateurs,
sad, and desperate people.</i>

18
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:46,012
- That means level 50.
- So you were...

19
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,583
Top witch in New York,
for starters.

20
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:52,118
Get me everything
on this list this week.

21
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,789
<i>I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.</i>

22
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,288
<i>Magic wasn't just handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,319
People at Brakebills, Jules,
they can read minds.

24
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,762
They can fly.
You can do a party trick.

25
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:01,227
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,688
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

27
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:06,766
not knowing that
I was a magician.

28
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,227
I can't go back.

29
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,233
Fuck...

30
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,135
Dude, you're in the wrong...

31
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,237
or I'm in the wrong, uh...

32
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,559
Hey! Big stuff.

33
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,696
- Hey.
- Got 'em? I'm dying.

34
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,571
Where are they?
Where are they?

35
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh, Jesus.

36
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,274
- Where are they?
- Cut it out.

37
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,843
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

38
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:59,746
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

39
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,047
Watercolors.

40
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,617
Without me, they're just...

41
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,154
Quentin, could I speak to you?

42
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:16,896
Quentin?

43
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,197
<i>Okay, this is obviously a dream</i>

44
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,667
where I realize I'm in a dream.

45
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:21,998
So you think your life
is a dream?

46
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,102
No, my life is my life,

47
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,771
but this is like a...

48
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,041
This is the bad collage.

49
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:28,009
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

50
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,108
the Brakebills...
it's all jumbled together.

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,080
So we're back to Brakebills?

52
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,309
Hopefully soon.

53
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,084
Where you think you're a student

54
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,116
studying to be a magician?

55
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,547
Okay, let's just skip the part

56
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,853
where you don't believe me,
okay?

57
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,115
Um, yeah,
it's a little chilly in here.

58
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,925
How about a miniature sun?

59
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,288
That'd be great.

60
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,979
I hate these dreams.

61
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,510
It's like your feet
are stuck to the floor

62
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,752
or you're paralyzed.

63
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:10,518
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,986
You released me, remember,
in the real hospital?

65
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,747
I remember what I said.
What was it?

66
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,915
Uh, "You can't keep me here.

67
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,693
I haven't hurt myself
or anybody else."

68
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:19,930
You know that isn't true.

69
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,627
Well, none of this is true,

70
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,098
but I said that to you
in real life before Brakebills.

71
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,868
Send him in.

72
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,199
Quentin, do you remember why

73
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,265
the court ordered you
to be here?

74
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:36,843
The court? I don't...

75
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,078
If this is a trial dream,
I am...

76
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,309
God, these things take forever.

77
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,145
Come in, Penny.

78
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,918
Show me again what you found
in Quentin's trash.

79
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,549
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

80
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,554
No. Hey,
it's okay, Penny.

81
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,116
No one's in trouble.

82
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,198
Thank you, Penny.

83
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,538
Quentin,

84
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,240
this is what happens when you
don't take what we prescribe.

85
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,012
You start to hallucinate again
that you're a magician,

86
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,211
you have powers.

87
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,247
It's all here...

88
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:17,917
uh, the house of cards, Alice,

89
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,988
Eliot, Margo,
the Physical Kids, The Beast.

90
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,826
I know this can
all seem very real,

91
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,527
but it's not.

92
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,698
Brakebills is the hallucination.

93
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,529
This is the reality.

94
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,535
You're seeing this, right?

95
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,567
You're very, very sick.

96
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,042
Are you not seeing this?

97
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,175
Oh, Jesus.

98
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,776
I see you, Quentin,
and I'm very, very worried.

99
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,145
Oh, okay.
They're gone.

100
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,915
The moths, they're...

101
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,194
- They're gone.
- There are no moths, Quentin.

102
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,260
There never were.

103
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,996
Ah!

104
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,834
Oh, I can't breathe.

105
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,769
Code red! Code red!
Main office!

106
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,818
Don't let them see.

107
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,996
I heard they shot you up.

108
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,697
I'm kind of foggy.

109
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,100
No, no, no.
Just focus on me, okay?

110
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:46,372
None of this is real.
Just us two.

111
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,213
And this.

112
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,512
Where are we?

113
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,881
I mean, what's going on?

114
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,617
You don't remember?

115
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:01,487
I... I was at school,
I think, and...

116
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,358
And then I fell asleep
at a party,

117
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:07,357
and then I'm here

118
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,330
where none of that
ever happened, and...

119
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,498
No, no, no, no, no, no.

120
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:11,557
- Oh, man.
- No.

121
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,295
You came to find me.

122
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,001
I did?

123
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,137
To save me.

124
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,507
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

125
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,068
The illusion?

126
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,036
I crash-landed on this planet
9.3 light-years ago.

127
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,875
- Alice?
- Wait.

128
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,250
You're a starship captain,
and you came to rescue me.

129
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,149
I... uh, no.
Hang on.

130
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,721
But none of this is real.
It's...

131
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:37,019
We're trapped in a cage,
a menagerie.

132
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,691
Alice?

133
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,992
And they show us these illusions

134
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,533
to make us fall
in love and mate.

135
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,356
Alice, that's enough.

136
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,426
Give them back.

137
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,495
- What, Dr. Fogg?
- All of them, Alice.

138
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,044
We need them for Bridge.

139
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,379
They collect us
from all over the galaxy

140
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,737
to feed off our emotions.

141
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,175
No, that's not true.

142
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,780
It's an episode
of "Lost in Space."

143
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,849
"Star Trek."

144
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,217
What?

145
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,578
That's an episode
of "Star Trek."

146
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:09,446
It's an episode
of "Star Trek."

147
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,416
They finally got to you.

148
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:15,025
You belong to them now.

149
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,288
It's okay.

150
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,126
I'll still mate with you.

151
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,697
All right, that's enough.

152
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,572
- Me three!
- That's enough.

153
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,037
Me three.

154
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:33,405
Quentin, how are you?

155
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:38,050
Are you feeling any better?

156
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,781
I guess.

157
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,286
Good.

158
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:45,288
Are you up for seeing a visitor?

159
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,326
Hey, Q.

160
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,304
I mean, Yale's still
kind of a letdown...

161
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:58,337
still, in the best way.

162
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,338
I mean, you would've...

163
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,010
Well, you... I mean, you will
totally agree, you know,

164
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,241
once, you know, it's you.

165
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,776
When what?
When I'm out?

166
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,611
It's just so much
easier than I...

167
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,176
than we expected, is all.

168
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:16,088
So you've been at Yale
these last few months,

169
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,689
and I've been here?

170
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,526
You don't remember?

171
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,527
This? No.

172
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,660
Okay.

173
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,796
James is sorry
he couldn't make it tonight,

174
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,770
but he'll be by next week.

175
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,941
You know, we had
to lock down a church.

176
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,542
Church?

177
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,543
Mm-hmm.
For the wedding.

178
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,945
Are you engaged?

179
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,226
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

180
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,557
Seriously,
it doesn't even matter.

181
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:58,162
It's not important.

182
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,165
- It's a spell.
- A spell?

183
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,068
We're all trapped in it,
and I'm the only one who knows.

184
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,641
Okay, look.
I know that I just...

185
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,570
I sounded like Alice
just then, but I'll...

186
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:13,905
Hey, um, I swear I'm not crazy.

187
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,583
I want to understand, okay?

188
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,822
- I want to help you.
- No.

189
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:19,347
- Just tell me.
- No. No.

190
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,893
No. Okay, I can do this.

191
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,201
Oh, God, look.

192
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,171
Jules.

193
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,239
Jules, look.

194
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
Look.
Are you seeing this?

195
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,710
Look!

196
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,541
Are you guys...
are you not seeing this?

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,350
Okay.

198
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
- Don't...
- What?

199
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,192
- Look at me like that.
- Q...

200
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,726
Don't feel sorry for me.
Do not.

201
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,032
I'm not me, and you're not you,
and this is not happening.

202
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,666
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

203
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm not... I'm not here.

204
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,708
I am the one that
got into Brakebills.

205
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,767
- I'm in Brakebills!
- Hey, you!

206
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,536
Keep your voice down.

207
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,575
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, um...

208
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,122
Sorry.

209
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,558
Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?

210
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,159
Um, I'll be back Friday.

211
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,766
This can't be my life.

212
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,827
Jules, it can't be.

213
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,112
I wanted to see the fireworks.

214
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,053
I really did.

215
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,047
Wait.

216
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,956
How did you know
they were fireworks?

217
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,017
What?

218
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,255
If you couldn't see them,

219
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,989
how did you know
they were fireworks?

220
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,594
You told me.

221
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:13,626
I never said the word
"fireworks," Julia.

222
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,037
What's going on here?

223
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,977
Okay, did nobody see that?

224
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:28,578
- See what?
- You laughing at me.

225
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,982
Laughing at you?

226
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,745
What kind of a friend
would do that?

227
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,085
Exactly.

228
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,227
Good-bye, Quentin.

229
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,065
What?

230
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,512
All of them one by one.

231
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,647
Begin.

232
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,560
I believe you, Quentin.

233
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,731
You are a magician...

234
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,530
A very bad one.

235
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,907
One thing that's real:

236
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,138
you're always a raging dick.

237
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,156
Ellsworth Downs.

238
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,593
Ellsworth Downs.

239
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,996
Ellsworth Downs.

240
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,198
Ellsworth.

241
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,501
Ellsworth Downs.

242
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,914
You know.

243
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,047
You know where to look, Quentin.

244
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,978
I can't show you.

245
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,152
I can't touch you.

246
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,788
It's very strong, this spell.

247
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,919
It is?

248
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,523
It is a spell?

249
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,755
It's in the book,
but the book is you.

250
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,561
This is all you.

251
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,563
Me?

252
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,867
Uh, which book?

253
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,570
Jane?

254
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,506
I can't remember what, uh...

255
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,837
Jane, they gave me pills,
and I can't... I can't remember.

256
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,613
Jane.

257
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,151
<i>Jane.</i>

258
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:56,996
No, No!

259
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,427
No, stop!
Stop it!

260
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,466
Stop! No!

261
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,167
The answer's in these books.

262
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:07,668
Jane said that these books are
my key to getting out of here.

263
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,509
Jesus.

264
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,140
Every time I talk,
I sound batshit.

265
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,888
Could I get some tape anyplace?

266
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,557
Tape isn't permitted.

267
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,627
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, I know.

268
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,188
But why, again?

269
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,096
'Cause you can harm
yourself or others.

270
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,566
It's tape.

271
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,467
That can strangle, suffocate...

272
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,469
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

273
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,707
No one has that kind of time.

274
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,568
I need to put these pages
back together.

275
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,506
You need to get
to music therapy.

276
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,086
Music is a way for us
to express and receive feeling

277
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:57,187
in a way that is safe and fun

278
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,720
and sometimes illuminating.

279
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,056
So who'd like to begin?

280
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,529
Oh, God,
please not that one song.

281
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,930
Ah, I'm sorry.

282
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,800
What was that, Penny?

283
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:11,770
Oh, that one song, please, no.

284
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,209
It gets in my head,
and it never leaves.

285
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,567
Oh, which song is that?

286
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,035
"Michael Rowed
the Boat Ashore."

287
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,946
#Agree.

288
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,507
Everything here is me.

289
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,915
All right, everyone,

290
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,717
why don't we kick it off
with the Beatles?

291
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,649
"Helter Skelter."
Helter Skelter," please!

292
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,585

Hey, Penny, good luck
getting that out of your head.

324
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,269
<i>Doctor...</i>

325
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,276
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, Quentin.

326
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,909
Look, I think I know
what's going on here,

327
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,914
and I think I know
how to get help.

328
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,846
Well, help is why we're here.

329
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,181
No, it's not.

330
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,746
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're here

331
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,954
because of a spell, and I need
to break the spell.

332
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,285
Quentin...

333
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,259
And if I can just reach
Penny, the real Penny,

334
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,628
and if... if I can get
inside of his head...

335
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:15,857
Enough.

336
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,762
That's enough.

337
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,999
Can I please have some tape?

338
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,365
Do you remember the last time
you saw your father?

339
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,114
Dinner a few months ago.

340
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,342
Why?

341
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,421
Dad?

342
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,791
Hello, Curly Q.

343
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,432
I...

344
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,297
What happened to your face?

345
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,866
Did you run into a door or...

346
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,380
You did that, Quentin.

347
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,249
I...

348
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,620
Come on.

349
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,721
It's time you see something.

350
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,955
<i>Look, I'm telling you
it wasn't my dad.</i>

351
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,631
<i>It was The Beast.</i>

352
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,400
<i>I never even touched him!
I used battle magic,</i>

353
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,401
<i>the same magic that I'm gonna
use to get out of here.</i>

354
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,973
<i>Are you ready?
Come on. Come on!</i>

355
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,944
<i>What did you do to my powers?</i>

356
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:39,281
<i>I need my powers.
The Beast is here, okay?</i>

357
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:41,649
<i>He's coming for me.
He's coming for you.</i>

358
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,078
<i>He is coming to kill us.</i>

359
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,918
<i>You have got to give me
back my power!</i>

360
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,856
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

361
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,287
<i>Ahh!</i>

362
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,130
Do you remember that night?

363
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:02,000
Um...

364
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,201
Your father does.

365
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,704
Tell him, Ted.

366
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,136
He needs to hear it.

367
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:12,211
He needs to know the truth
why he's here.

368
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,947
We were having dinner
to celebrate

369
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:19,078
when you got into Yale, and...

370
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,745
in the middle of the restaurant,

371
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,053
you suddenly said
there were moths everywhere.

372
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,416
No.

373
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,424
And then you started
calling me The Beast.

374
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,326
Mm-mm.

375
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,228
You're lying.

376
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,899
And then you picked up a knife.

377
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,098
- Mm-mm. No.
- I tried to stop you.

378
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,400
I grabbed you.
I tried to stop you from...

379
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,738
What?
From... from what?

380
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,209
You tried to kill
your father, Quentin.

381
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,947
You need to stop fighting this
Quentin.

382
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,857
The more you believe in magic,
Brakebills, The Beast,

383
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,488
<i>the more harm you do.</i>

384
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:05,864
<i>Accept who you are
and what's put you here.</i>

385
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:09,025
That's how you get better,
Quentin.

386
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,335
<i>I promise.</i>

387
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,206
Hey, you, seriously, talk to me.

388
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:18,407
Are you fucking with me?

389
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,413
Dude.

390
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:26,075
Uh, um, look, this'll
all be over soon, okay?

391
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,545
Just try not
to get buried under it.

392
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,523
I'm gonna talk to someone.
Shit.

393
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,389

00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,456
I'm talking to you.

408
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,157
I told you, keep up
with that stupid song,

409
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,559
and I'd come right
into your brain and rip it out.

410
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,360
- No, no, no.
- Well, here I am.

411
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:12,132
By the way, this is the most
pathetic loser dream ever.

412
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,861
Stop, okay? Just stop.

413
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,796
Please stop. Stop.

414
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,071
Please be knowing that dinner
will be served in five minutes,

415
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,472
and today, we are to be
serving chicken curry,

416
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:26,235
which is, of course,
my favorite.

417
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:31,815
You racist motherfucker.

418
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,518
You're not real.

419
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:39,289
Yeah, how's that?
Real enough?

420
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,192
That hurt.

421
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,728
Do it again, harder.

422
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,799
What kind of sick shit
are you about, Coldwater?

423
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,827
Harder.

424
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,367
Ow.

425
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,937
Nobody here can see you.

426
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:59,077
Yeah, 'cause there's
no here, dumbass.

427
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,278
This is all in your head.

428
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,347
I'm in your head.

429
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,548
Now stop singing that song so I
can go the fuck back to sleep.

430
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,020
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

431
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,118
Oh, my God.
It worked.

432
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,321
I did that.
I called you.

433
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,060
I called you with the song.

434
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,087
- You called me?
- I'm in trouble.

435
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,792
Seriously, help me.

436
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,525
- What is today out there?
- Wednesday.

437
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:21,431
So I've only been gone
for a night.

438
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,101
Am I asleep there somewhere?

439
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,202
Man, I don't know
what you do at night,

440
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,403
and I don't want to know.

441
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,295
- Where are you?
- Trying to sleep.

442
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,436
This is not a dream.

443
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,941
It... it's a...

444
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,310
All of this, it's a spell.

445
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:36,911
Please, listen.
Find me, okay?

446
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,176
Out there, find me.

447
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,219
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

448
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,750
Okay, you have to wake up.

449
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,285
Wake up.

450
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,757
Wake up. Wake up.

451
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,958
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!

452
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,489
You, you will not be shouting.

453
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,025
End it now, buster.

454
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,430
Wake the hell up!

455
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,407
Okay.

456
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:05,038
Good job.

457
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:08,113
Wow.

458
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:12,384
My whole body, every part
of my body, is tingling.

459
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:13,945
I mean, you didn't tell me
it would feel...

460
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,153
So good?

461
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:20,215
It's high-end, designer
cooperative magic.

462
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:23,526
It does something to your cells
to channel all that juice.

463
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,029
Everyone gets stronger.

464
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:28,832
Um, I just, um...

465
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:34,135
I didn't think Q
would, uh, fall in so deep.

466
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,108
Oh, this is nothing.

467
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,109
Uh, what...
what does that mean?

468
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,982
Well, I mean he might want
to take his shoes off

469
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,348
and get comfortable.

470
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,949
We cooked up a whopper here.

471
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,151
I don't really see him
getting out of it,

472
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,023
even with your boyfriend's help.

473
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:56,328
Mm, I thought the idea
was to just mess with him.

474
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:00,229
My idea was to fuck him up hard,

475
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:04,336
and you loved it even harder.

476
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,837
Yeah, yeah, fuck him up,
not kill him.

477
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,239
Wait, what?
Kill him?

478
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,241
Oh, he's not gonna die.

479
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:14,079
He just might not actually
ever wake up.

480
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,010
Oh, my God.

481
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,275
Hey, you are not going
limp on me here.

482
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:21,820
This is game time, ladies.

483
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,921
You got the ball, Kady.

484
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:26,558
Don't drop it.

485
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,159
Now go put all that
sweet hotness to work.

486
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,378
Sorry.

Oh, God.

492
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,120
Okay.

"The Madness Maker's

00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,583
It's okay. It's okay.
I know this. I know this.

I know this.

What did Jane say?

515
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,258
God, why can't I remember?

516
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:48,433
Okay, look, I am, like,
100% sure I invented you,

517
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:52,237
so if you could please
just disappear?

518
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,207
Look, it was a party.

519
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,138
He's probably sleeping it off
under something

520
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,775
or someone or...

521
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,048
Hey.

522
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,479
Where you been?

523
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,353
I had to run into the city.

524
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:07,952
What's up?

525
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,553
Your lover man here
thinks our little Q

526
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,086
got roofied last night.

527
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,291
Look, we covered the house.

528
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,892
Let's start checking the lab,

529
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:17,862
the libraries, or whatever.

530
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,397
I know where he is.

531
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,039
He crawled in here
and passed out around 1:00.

532
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,009
Anyway, I've seen weirder.

533
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,480
Come on.
Hey, wake up.

534
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:36,878
He's breathing.
That's something.

535
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,917
Let me try.

536
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,416
This is bad.

537
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,824
How bad?

538
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,756
"We need to tell the dean" bad.

539
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,103
Now what?

540
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,035
We wait.

541
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,440
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

542
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,175
I did.

543
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,348
Bigger, better magic.

544
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,518
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

545
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,787
I guess I could tell you now.

546
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,048
No, I don't feel like it.

547
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,856
Later maybe?

548
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,788
Mm, how about never?
That's a growing possibility.

549
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,460
Hmm.

550
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,965
Yes, I thought so.

551
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:31,098
The spell is called
a Scarlatti Web.

552
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,343
We cannot break it.

553
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:33,838
No one can.

554
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,569
Wait, he's not
gonna wake up ever?

555
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,905
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

556
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,052
We need to summon a Matarese.

557
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,576
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

558
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,516
I was wrong.

559
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,225
No.
What are you...

560
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,559
Lower the wards please.

561
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:09,966
Very good. And now the South
wards.

562
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:17,105
Dean Fogg following
the playbook.

563
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:20,176
The only thing that can break
our spell on your ex-BFF

564
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:24,486
is a Matarese... evil bug spirit
of the underworld.

565
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,060
About the only way
one of those can get

566
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:28,588
into this sugary wonderland

567
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,264
<i>is to lower all the protective
wards and shields</i>

568
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:34,903
in the school, letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

569
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,467
Welcome back to Brakebills.

570
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,942
Let's go steal their shit.

571
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,491
Careful.

572
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:05,296
Good.

573
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:08,827
<i>Daemonium Matarese, ecce vocavi</i>

574
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,302
<i>te in carcere liberare mens est.</i>

575
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:14,072
<i>Imperio Scarlatti telem nobus.</i>

576
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:17,242
That's the answer?

577
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:18,981
It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

578
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:21,248
which should break him
out of the spell,

579
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,307
which should bring him back,
halfway.

580
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,375
Halfway?

581
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,353
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

582
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,324
The Matarese breaks you
out of the prison,

583
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:33,558
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

584
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,559
and it is a lot easier
with a guide.

585
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,462
Penny, are you ready?

586
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,294
Quentin?

587
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,567
Quentin!
Answer me!

588
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,038
The problem is
in your frontal lobe, Quentin.

589
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,539
Your emotions are
in complete control now,

590
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:27,979
overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

591
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,410
So this...

592
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,423
Is inserted into the eye socket.

593
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:35,049
No, no, no, no, no.

594
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,224
It's called
a transorbital lobotomy.

595
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,525
Dad.

596
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,527
Dad. Dad.

597
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,330
No, no, no, no, no, no.

598
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,299
No, no, don't!

599
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,500
Dad, don't!

600
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,601
Dad!

601
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,907
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

602
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,608
No, please, don't.
I didn't mean to, I swear.

603
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,309
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, stop!

604
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,312
Stop talking.
Stop listening.

605
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,283
There are only three things
that are real: you, me, and...

606
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,858
That.

607
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,489
Get up.
There are no straps.

608
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,128
This is not a hospital.

609
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,298
You are not crazy.

610
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,927
You can make it disappear.

611
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,332
Do it!

612
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,814
Quentin?

613
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:42,020
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

614
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,421
Wait, you went here?

615
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:46,292
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

616
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:49,427
So, what, this is revenge?

617
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,858
When you're here for that long,

618
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,463
they can't just erase you.

619
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,134
They take you
into a special room

620
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:55,533
off the dean's office

621
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,503
and remove every memory
you make here.

622
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:04,842
Every single magical thing
you learned amputated,

623
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,913
but those memories are stored.

624
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,451
Normally there's a shield
on this door

625
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,553
a hundred magicians
couldn't break.

626
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,955
Now...

627
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,389
Keep a lookout.

628
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,755
Wait, what's going...

629
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,135
It isn't working.
What happened?

630
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,740
I don't know.
I went there.

631
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,942
I told him,
the Matarese did his thing,

632
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,846
and then everything went black.

633
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,427
Hey.

634
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,028
He's not gonna wake up...

635
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,030
ever.

636
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,231
No, Marina just has to...

637
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:03,801
Marina is a psycho.

638
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:06,938
You were his friend.

639
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,439
It's her spell.
I can't...

640
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,109
No, I didn't sign up
for this shit.

641
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,480
No, you have to go
reverse it now.

642
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,361
Well, I can finally
reach you again,

643
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:08,104
but that's never been
the problem, has it...

644
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:09,900
my reaching you?

645
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,270
Will you please,
just for once...

646
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,401
no more riddles, okay?

647
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,336
Just tell me what to do.

648
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,910
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

649
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,341
You make the web you're in.

650
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,105
You're the spider and the fly,

651
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,845
just like...

652
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,291
Look, I can help.

653
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,833
I can give you the exact
wording of the spell.

654
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,287
It's too late.

655
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,926
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

656
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah, bullshit.
You did it to get even.

657
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:42,499
Oh, fuck you!
Somebody help him.

658
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,739
If I had the exact spell
wording one hour ago,...

659
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,097
There's got to be something.

660
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,335
You have any idea
where he is right now?

661
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,841
Why would you do this?

662
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,742
She didn't.

663
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,279
Not by herself.
Did you?

664
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,346
You sure you want to play?

665
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:11,155
No. I'm not sure of anything.

666
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:14,899
Except I'm tired, so tired.

667
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,330
Of?

668
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,466
Fighting all the time,

669
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,041
becoming someone that
I actually want to be,

670
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:24,239
and then realizing that I...

671
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:27,478
Am nothing.

672
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,347
So you made the hospital,

673
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:32,817
conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

674
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,018
Of course you're exhausted.

675
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,990
And you can hide
from it all forever

676
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,791
in this lovely, quiet,
blank void.

677
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,129
But you also built a way out.

678
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,099
Otherwise,
why are he and I here?

679
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,169
"The Madness Maker didn't
play for the joy of winning,

680
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,806
"just the fear of losing.

681
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,512
"The real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

682
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:08,245
"which cut him off
from the surprise,

683
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:12,089
horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

684
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:19,761
"Jane saw only one way
out for him:

685
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,995
"stop playing.

686
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:26,001
Start living."

687
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,280
Hey.

688
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,375
Somebody woke up.

689
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,946
Took your damn time.

690
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,892
Somebody get him some brandy.

691
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,061
Flying in.

692
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,497
Wait.

693
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,028
Where's the hedge bitch?

694
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,736
Chop-chop.

695
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,067
They're going back up.

696
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,418
You should've told me your
friend wasn't properly erased.

697
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,746
I know.

698
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,054
And you and Eliot
never should've taken on

699
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,355
the hedge witches alone.

700
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,887
I know.

701
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:25,830
Quentin, do you really think
that the magic that we teach

702
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:31,268
means that you just get
to fly above right and wrong?

703
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,769
Magic does not solve problems.

704
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,442
It magnifies them.
I know that too.

705
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,508
Believe me.

706
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,079
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

707
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,947
I need to be taught magic

708
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:46,978
so that I can decide
what it is or isn't...

709
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,045
for me.

710
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,255
That was almost well put.

711
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,087
Good night, Quentin.

712
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,829
Oh, and Quentin...

713
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,065
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

714
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:13,081
Me too, actually.

715
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,345
Wow.

716
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:23,921
Wow.

717
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:30,861
I kind of can't believe
I ever thought I knew...

718
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:34,062
anything.

719
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,095
I'd like to share now

720
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:40,141
some of it with some of you.

721
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,379
Ow!

722
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:57,185
Wait. Wait.

723
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,819
No. No.

724
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,055
I didn't get you out of there

725
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,159
because you pulled one
over on me.

726
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,996
You and Kady bitched out,
but you'd talk.

727
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:10,167
She can't.

728
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:14,868
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

729
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:18,476
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

730
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:21,407
You don't know cut off.

731
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,813
But, baby...

732
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,947
<i>You will.</i>
