1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,728
<i>Previously on The Magicians.</i>

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:03,743
<i>Before I got here,</i>
<i>I was in the hospital.</i>

3
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,830
Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,771
Look, I've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else,

5
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:11,009
so you can't make me stay.

6
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,249
<i>Brakebills is the first place</i>
<i>that feels right to me</i>

7
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,953
<i>that is not</i>
<i>literally a fairy tale.</i>

8
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,030
Quentin!

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,564
I made the mistake of
thinking you were just psychic.

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:20,607
Do you know
how to close your mind?

11
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,558
'Cause I will
show you right now!

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,267
You are a traveler.

13
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:28,740
<i>You can actually move</i>
<i>between worlds.</i>

14
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,063
Where are you going, kitty cat?

15
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,756
I'm done here for good.

16
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,853
You should be happy--
less competition.

17
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,547
<i>Hedge witches: amateurs,</i>
<i>sad, and desperate people.</i>

18
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:44,800
- That means level 50.
- So you were--

19
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,386
Top witch in New York,
for starters.

20
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:50,577
Get me everything
on this list this week.

21
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,208
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you're doing here, Jules.</i>

22
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,781
<i>Magic wasn't just handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,112
People at Brakebills, Jules,
they can read minds.

24
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,564
They can fly.
You can do a party trick.

25
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,032
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,484
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

27
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,241
not knowing that
I was a magician.

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,039
I can't go back.

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,022
Fuck...

30
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,940
Dude, you're in the wrong--

31
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,027
or I'm in the wrong, uh...

32
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:44,336
Hey! Big stuff.

33
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,505
- Hey.
- Got 'em? I'm dying.

34
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,340
Where are they?
Where are they?

35
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,592
Oh, Jesus.

36
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,060
- Where are they?
- Cut it out.

37
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,646
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

38
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:58,517
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

39
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,853
Watercolors.

40
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,405
Without me, they're just--

41
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,943
Quentin, could I speak to you?

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,701
Quentin?

43
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,033
<i>Okay, this is obviously a dream</i>

44
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,455
where I realize I'm in a dream.

45
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,861
So you think your life
is a dream?

46
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
No, my life is my life,

47
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,542
but this is like a--

48
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,843
This is the bad collage.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,795
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

50
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,881
the Brakebills--
it's all jumbled together.

51
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,883
So we're back to Brakebills?

52
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,101
Hopefully soon.

53
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,886
Where you think you're a student

54
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,888
studying to be a magician?

55
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,357
Okay, let's just skip the part

56
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,643
where you don't believe me,
okay?

57
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,896
Um, yeah,
it's a little chilly in here.

58
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,732
How about a miniature sun?

59
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,067
That'd be great.

60
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:04,750
I hate these dreams.

61
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,302
It's like your feet
are stuck to the floor

62
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,553
or you're paralyzed.

63
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,305
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,757
You released me, remember,
in the real hospital?

65
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,559
I remember what I said.
What was it?

66
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,728
Uh, "You can't keep me here.

67
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,479
I haven't hurt myself
or anybody else."

68
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,731
You know that isn't true.

69
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,432
Well, none of this is true,

70
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:23,902
but I said that to you
in real life before Brakebills.

71
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:27,656
Send him in.

72
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,992
Quentin, do you remember why

73
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,077
the court ordered you
to be here?

74
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,614
The court? I don't...

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,866
If this is a trial dream,
I am--

76
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,119
God, these things take forever.

77
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:41,954
Come in, Penny.

78
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,707
Show me again what you found
in Quentin's trash.

79
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,353
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

80
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,344
No. Hey,
it's okay, Penny.

81
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,928
No one's in trouble.

82
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,971
Thank you, Penny.

83
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,310
Quentin,

84
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,029
this is what happens when you
don't take what we prescribe.

85
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,815
You start to hallucinate again
that you're a magician,

86
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:10,983
you have powers.

87
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,035
It's all here--

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,705
uh, the house of cards, Alice,

89
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:22,795
Eliot, Margo,
the Physical Kids, The Beast.

90
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,631
I know this can
all seem very real,

91
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,332
but it's not.

92
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,502
Brakebills is the hallucination.

93
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,338
This is the reality.

94
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,340
You're seeing this, right?

95
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,342
You're very, very sick.

96
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,847
Are you not seeing this?

97
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,983
Oh, Jesus.

98
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,572
I see you, Quentin,
and I'm very, very worried.

99
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:53,942
Oh, okay.
They're gone.

100
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:55,694
The moths, they're--

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,996
- They're gone.
- There are no moths, Quentin.

102
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,032
There never were.

103
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,786
Ah!

104
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,623
Oh, I can't breathe.

105
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,545
Code red! Code red!
Main office!

106
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:29,443
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

107
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,613
Don't let them see.

108
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,784
I heard they shot you up.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,487
I'm kind of foggy.

110
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,906
No, no, no.
Just focus on me, okay?

111
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:45,160
None of this is real.
Just us two.

112
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,995
And this.

113
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,300
Where are we?

114
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,669
I mean, what's going on?

115
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,421
You don't remember?

116
00:06:56,474 --> 00:07:00,259
I--I was at school,
I think, and...

117
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,144
And then I fell asleep
at a party,

118
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,148
and then I'm here

119
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,100
where none of that
ever happened, and--

120
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,268
No, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,352
- Oh, man.
- No.

122
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,105
You came to find me.

123
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,773
I did?

124
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,942
To save me.

125
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:20,279
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

126
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,864
The illusion?

127
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,909
I crash-landed on this planet
9.3 light-years ago.

128
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,667
- Alice?
- Wait.

129
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,036
You're a starship captain,
and you came to rescue me.

130
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,955
I--uh, no.
Hang on.

131
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,507
But none of this is real.
It's--

132
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:35,794
We're trapped in a cage,
a menagerie.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,462
Alice?

134
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,828
And they show us these illusions

135
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,299
to make us fall
in love and mate.

136
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,137
Alice, that's enough.

137
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,222
Give them back.

138
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,308
- What, Dr. Fogg?
- All of them, Alice.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,809
We need them for Bridge.

140
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,148
They collect us
from all over the galaxy

141
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,533
to feed off our emotions.

142
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:58,984
No, that's not true.

143
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,569
It's an episode
of "Lost in Space."

144
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,653
"Star Trek."

145
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:02,988
What?

146
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:04,434
That's an episode
of "Star Trek."

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,243
It's an episode
of "Star Trek."

148
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,212
They finally got to you.

149
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,832
You belong to them now.

150
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,083
It's okay.

151
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll still mate with you.

152
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,505
All right, that's enough.

153
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,341
- Me three!
- That's enough.

154
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,842
Me three.

155
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:32,184
Quentin, how are you?

156
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you feeling any better?

157
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,574
I guess.

158
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,075
Good.

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,079
Are you up for seeing a visitor?

160
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:50,118
Hey, Q.

161
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,876
I mean, Yale's still
kind of a letdown--

162
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,911
still, in the best way.

163
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,913
I mean, you would've--

164
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,584
Well, you--I mean, you will
totally agree, you know,

165
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,836
once, you know, it's you.

166
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,337
When what?
When I'm out?

167
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,173
It's just so much
easier than I--

168
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,758
than we expected, is all.

169
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:14,679
So you've been at Yale
these last few months,

170
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,265
and I've been here?

171
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't remember?

172
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,103
This? No.

173
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,239
Okay.

174
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:27,358
James is sorry
he couldn't make it tonight,

175
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,360
but he'll be by next week.

176
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,531
You know, we had
to lock down a church.

177
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,116
Church?

178
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,118
Mm-hmm.
For the wedding.

179
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,544
Are you engaged?

180
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,801
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

181
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,207
Seriously,
it doesn't even matter.

182
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,721
It's not important.

183
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,724
- It's a spell.
- A spell?

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,645
We're all trapped in it,
and I'm the only one who knows.

185
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,230
Okay, look.
I know that I just--

186
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,148
I sounded like Alice
just then, but I'll--

187
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:12,487
Hey, um, I swear I'm not crazy.

188
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,155
I want to understand, okay?

189
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,406
- I want to help you.
- No.

190
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,909
- Just tell me.
- No. No.

191
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:21,463
No. Okay, I can do this.

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,759
Oh, God, look.

193
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:37,762
Jules.

194
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:38,813
Jules, look.

195
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,431
Look.
Are you seeing this?

196
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,268
Look!

197
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,103
Are you guys--
are you not seeing this?

198
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,946
Okay.

199
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,451
- Don't...
- What?

200
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,127
- Look at me like that.
- Q--

201
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,289
Don't feel sorry for me.
Do not.

202
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm not me, and you're not you,
and this is not happening.

203
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,260
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

204
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,628
I'm not--I'm not here.

205
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,297
I am the one that
got into Brakebills.

206
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,349
- I'm in Brakebills!
- Hey, you!

207
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:17,135
Keep your voice down.

208
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,139
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, um...

209
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,690
Sorry.

210
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,634
Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?

211
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:34,055
Um, I'll be back Friday.

212
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:39,324
This can't be my life.

213
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,409
Jules, it can't be.

214
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,669
I wanted to see the fireworks.

215
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,638
I really did.

216
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,644
Wait.

217
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,513
How did you know
they were fireworks?

218
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,598
What?

219
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:04,849
If you couldn't see them,

220
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,568
how did you know
they were fireworks?

221
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,186
You told me.

222
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:12,190
I never said the word
"fireworks," Julia.

223
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,611
What's going on here?

224
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,534
Okay, did nobody see that?

225
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,171
- See what?
- You laughing at me.

226
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:30,541
Laughing at you?

227
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,344
What kind of a friend
would do that?

228
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,680
Exactly.

229
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,802
Good-bye, Quentin.

230
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,643
What?

231
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,724
All of them one by one.

232
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,843
Begin.

233
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:13,559
I believe you, Quentin.

234
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:16,696
You are a magician...

235
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,534
A very bad one.

236
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,906
One thing that's real:

237
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,159
you're always a raging dick.

238
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,140
Ellsworth Downs.

239
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:48,594
Ellsworth Downs.

240
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:51,013
Ellsworth Downs.

241
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,182
Ellsworth.

242
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,518
Ellsworth Downs.

243
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:01,858
You know.

244
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:07,029
You know where to look, Quentin.

245
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,998
I can't show you.

246
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:12,168
I can't touch you.

247
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,787
It's very strong, this spell.

248
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,922
It is?

249
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,540
It is a spell?

250
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:20,760
It's in the book,
but the book is you.

251
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,545
This is all you.

252
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,547
Me?

253
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:28,885
Uh, which book?

254
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,553
Jane?

255
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:33,523
I can't remember what,
uh--

256
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:36,859
Jane, they gave me pills,
and I can't--I can't remember.

257
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:39,612
Jane.

258
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:45,151
<i>Jane.</i>

259
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:55,995
No, No!

260
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,413
No, stop!
Stop it!

261
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,465
Stop! No!

262
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,167
The answer's in these books.

263
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:06,672
Jane said that these books are
my key to getting out of here.

264
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:09,509
Jesus.

265
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,144
Every time I talk,
I sound batshit.

266
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,905
Could I get some tape anyplace?

267
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,574
Tape isn't permitted.

268
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:27,610
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, I know.

269
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,195
But why, again?

270
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:32,114
'Cause you can harm
yourself or others.

271
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,583
It's tape.

272
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,451
That can strangle,
suffocate--

273
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,454
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

274
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,706
No one has that kind of time.

275
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:42,592
I need to put these pages
back together.

276
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,460
You need to get
to music therapy.

277
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:53,102
Music is a way for us
to express and receive feeling

278
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:56,188
in a way that is safe and fun

279
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:58,724
and sometimes illuminating.

280
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,059
So who'd like to begin?

281
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:02,528
Oh, God,
please not that one song.

282
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:03,946
Ah, I'm sorry.

283
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,816
What was that, Penny?

284
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:10,786
Oh, that one song, please, no.

285
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,205
It gets in my head,
and it never leaves.

286
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,574
Oh, which song is that?

287
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:17,043
"Michael Rowed
the Boat Ashore."

288
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:19,962
#Agree.

289
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,497
Everything here is me.

290
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,915
All right, everyone,

291
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,717
why don't we kick it off
with the Beatles?

292
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:27,670
"Helter Skelter."
Helter Skelter," please!

293
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,589

Hey, Penny, good luck
getting that out of your head.

326
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,635
<i>Doctor...</i>

327
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,415
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, Quentin.

328
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,376
Look, I think I know
what's going on here,

329
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:00,901
and I think I know
how to get help.

330
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,781
Well, help is why we're here.

331
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,401
No, it's not.

332
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:05,986
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're here

333
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,154
because of a spell, and I need
to break the spell.

334
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:08,488
Quentin--

335
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,490
And if I can just reach
Penny, the real Penny,

336
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,826
and if--if I can get
inside of his head--

337
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:14,077
Enough.

338
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,963
That's enough.

339
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,221
Can I please have some tape?

340
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:27,591
Do you remember the last time
you saw your father?

341
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:30,344
Dinner a few months ago.

342
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:31,511
Why?

343
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,654
Dad?

344
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,024
Hello, Curly Q.

345
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,610
I...

346
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,538
What happened to your face?

347
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,041
Did you run into a door or...

348
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:06,596
You did that, Quentin.

349
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,465
I--

350
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:12,853
Come on.

351
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,888
It's time you see something.

352
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,195
<i>Look, I'm telling you</i>
<i>it wasn't my dad.</i>

353
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:23,864
<i>It was The Beast.</i>

354
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:26,616
<i>I never even touched him!</i>
<i>I used battle magic,</i>

355
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,618
<i>the same magic that I'm gonna</i>
<i>use to get out of here.</i>

356
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:33,206
<i>Are you ready?</i>
<i>Come on. Come on!</i>

357
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:35,158
<i>What did you do to my powers?</i>

358
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,494
<i>I need my powers.</i>
<i>The Beast is here, okay?</i>

359
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,880
<i>He's coming for me.</i>
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

360
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,298
<i>He is coming to kill us.</i>

361
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,134
<i>You have got to give me</i>
<i>back my power!</i>

362
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:49,089
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

363
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:50,507
<i>Ahh!</i>

364
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,347
Do you remember that night?

365
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,233
Um...

366
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,436
Your father does.

367
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:04,938
Tell him, Ted.

368
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,356
He needs to hear it.

369
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:10,444
He needs to know the truth
why he's here.

370
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:13,163
We were having dinner
to celebrate

371
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:17,284
when you got into Yale, and...

372
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:18,952
in the middle of the restaurant,

373
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:21,288
you suddenly said
there were moths everywhere.

374
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,622
No.

375
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,624
And then you started
calling me The Beast.

376
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,543
Mm-mm.

377
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,462
You're lying.

378
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:30,130
And then you picked up a knife.

379
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,299
- Mm-mm. No.
- I tried to stop you.

380
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:35,635
I grabbed you.
I tried to stop you from...

381
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,971
What?
From--from what?

382
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:40,440
You tried to kill
your father, Quentin.

383
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,125
You need to stop fighting this
Quentin.

384
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,731
The more you believe in magic,
Brakebills, The Beast,

385
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:59,043
<i>the more harm you do.</i>

386
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:03,703
<i>Accept who you are</i>
<i>and what's put you here.</i>

387
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,231
That's how you get better,
Quentin.

388
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,727
<i>I promise.</i>

389
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:12,008
Hey, you, seriously, talk to me.

390
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:15,767
Are you fucking with me?

391
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,771
Dude.

392
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:23,442
Uh, um, look, this'll
all be over soon, okay?

393
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,944
Just try not
to get buried under it.

394
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:28,914
I'm gonna talk to someone.
Shit.

395
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,784

Yeah, that's right.

00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,227
I'm talking to you.

410
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:03,953
I told you, keep up
with that stupid song,

411
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,364
and I'd come right
into your brain and rip it out.

412
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,149
- No, no, no.
- Well, here I am.

413
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:09,902
By the way, this is the most
pathetic loser dream ever.

414
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:11,654
Stop, okay? Just stop.

415
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,572
Please stop. Stop.

416
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:16,875
Please be knowing that dinner
will be served in five minutes,

417
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:20,245
and today, we are to be
serving chicken curry,

418
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:24,049
which is, of course,
my favorite.

419
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:29,588
You racist motherfucker.

420
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,307
You're not real.

421
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:37,096
Yeah, how's that?
Real enough?

422
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,981
That hurt.

423
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,516
Do it again, harder.

424
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:42,601
What kind of sick shit
are you about, Coldwater?

425
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,602
Harder.

426
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,159
Ow.

427
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,746
Nobody here can see you.

428
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:56,865
Yeah, 'cause there's
no here, dumbass.

429
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,083
This is all in your head.

430
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,119
I'm in your head.

431
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,338
Now stop singing that song so I
can go the fuck back to sleep.

432
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,789
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

433
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,924
Oh, my God.
It worked.

434
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,126
I did that.
I called you.

435
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,844
I called you with the song.

436
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,879
- You called me?
- I'm in trouble.

437
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:13,599
Seriously, help me.

438
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:16,301
- What is today out there?
- Wednesday.

439
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:19,221
So I've only been gone
for a night.

440
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,889
Am I asleep there somewhere?

441
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:21,974
Man, I don't know
what you do at night,

442
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:23,192
and I don't want to know.

443
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,110
- Where are you?
- Trying to sleep.

444
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:26,228
This is not a dream.

445
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:27,730
It--it's a--

446
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:30,115
All of this, it's a spell.

447
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:34,703
Please, listen.
Find me, okay?

448
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,988
Out there, find me.

449
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,991
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

450
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:40,542
Okay, you have to wake up.

451
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,077
Wake up.

452
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:43,545
Wake up. Wake up.

453
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,747
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!

454
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:47,299
You, you will not be shouting.

455
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,834
End it now, buster.

456
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,219
Wake the hell up!

457
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:00,179
Okay.

458
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:02,848
Good job.

459
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,901
Wow.

460
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:10,189
My whole body, every part
of my body, is tingling.

461
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,740
I mean, you didn't tell me
it would feel--

462
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,942
So good?

463
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:18,030
It's high-end, designer
cooperative magic.

464
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,333
It does something to your cells
to channel all that juice.

465
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,836
Everyone gets stronger.

466
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:26,622
Um, I just, um...

467
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:31,927
I didn't think Q
would, uh, fall in so deep.

468
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,880
Oh, this is nothing.

469
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:37,883
Uh, what--
what does that mean?

470
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,848
Well, I mean he might want
to take his shoes off

471
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,136
and get comfortable.

472
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:42,721
We cooked up a whopper here.

473
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,940
I don't really see him
getting out of it,

474
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,809
even with your boyfriend's help.

475
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:54,116
Mm, I thought the idea
was to just mess with him.

476
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,036
My idea was to fuck him up hard,

477
00:24:58,072 --> 00:25:02,124
and you loved it even harder.

478
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,626
Yeah, yeah, fuck him up,
not kill him.

479
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,044
Wait, what?
Kill him?

480
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,046
Oh, he's not gonna die.

481
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:11,884
He just might not actually
ever wake up.

482
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,802
Oh, my God.

483
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,088
Hey, you are not going
limp on me here.

484
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,591
This is game time, ladies.

485
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,727
You got the ball, Kady.

486
00:25:21,762 --> 00:25:24,346
Don't drop it.

487
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:27,933
Now go put all that
sweet hotness to work.

488
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:44,166
Sorry.

489
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,132

Oh, God.

494
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,980
Okay.

God, why can't I remember?

518
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,296
Okay, look, I am, like,
100% sure I invented you,

519
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,083
so if you could please
just disappear?

520
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,054
Look, it was a party.

521
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,007
He's probably sleeping it off
under something

00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,894
Hey.

524
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,345
Where you been?

525
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:04,181
I had to run into the city.

526
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,815
What's up?

527
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,401
Your lover man here
thinks our little Q

528
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,936
got roofied last night.

529
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,154
Look, we covered the house.

530
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,739
Let's start checking the lab,

531
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,692
the libraries, or whatever.

532
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,244
I know where he is.

533
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,869
He crawled in here
and passed out around 1:00.

534
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,872
Anyway, I've seen weirder.

535
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,340
Come on.
Hey, wake up.

536
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,711
He's breathing.
That's something.

537
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,763
Let me try.

538
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,270
This is bad.

539
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,688
How bad?

540
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,606
"We need to tell the dean" bad.

541
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:56,950
Now what?

542
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,902
We wait.

543
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,291
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

544
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,042
I did.

545
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,211
Bigger, better magic.

546
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,381
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

547
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,633
I guess I could tell you now.

548
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,918
No, I don't feel like it.

549
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,720
Later maybe?

550
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,639
Mm, how about never?
That's a growing possibility.

551
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,311
Hmm.

552
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,813
Yes, I thought so.

553
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,932
The spell is called
a Scarlatti Web.

554
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,183
We cannot break it.

555
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,685
No one can.

556
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,437
Wait, he's not
gonna wake up ever?

557
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,774
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

558
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,909
We need to summon a Matarese.

559
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,448
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

560
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,367
I was wrong.

561
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,125
No.
What are you--

562
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,459
Lower the wards please.

563
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,804
Very good. And now the South
wards.

564
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,978
Dean Fogg following
the playbook.

565
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,031
The only thing that can break
our spell on your ex-BFF

566
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:22,319
is a Matarese--evil bug spirit
of the underworld.

567
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,924
About the only way
one of those can get

568
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,456
into this sugary wonderland

569
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,125
<i>is to lower all the protective</i>
<i>wards and shields</i>

570
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,746
in the school, letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

571
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,336
Welcome back to Brakebills.

572
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:41,805
Let's go steal their shit.

573
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:55,352
Careful.

574
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,159
Good.

575
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,696
<i>Daemonium Matarese, ecce vocavi</i>

576
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:09,165
<i>te in carcere liberare mens est.</i>

577
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,918
<i>Imperio Scarlatti telem nobus.</i>

578
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,088
That's the answer?

579
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,840
It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

580
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,092
which should break him
out of the spell,

581
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,177
which should bring him back,
halfway.

582
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,213
Halfway?

583
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,216
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

584
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:28,184
The Matarese breaks you
out of the prison,

585
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,388
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

586
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,391
and it is a lot easier
with a guide.

587
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,309
Penny, are you ready?

588
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,141
Quentin?

589
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,431
Quentin!
Answer me!

590
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:17,901
The problem is
in your frontal lobe, Quentin.

591
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,404
Your emotions are
in complete control now,

592
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,825
overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

593
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,277
So this...

594
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:31,281
Is inserted into the eye socket.

595
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,916
No, no, no, no, no.

596
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,084
It's called
a transorbital lobotomy.

597
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,372
Dad.

598
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,375
Dad. Dad.

599
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,177
No, no, no, no, no, no.

600
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,129
No, no, don't!

601
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,804
Dad, don't!

602
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,065
Dad!

603
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:53,351
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:55,765
No, please, don't.
I didn't mean to, I swear.

605
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:57,772
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, stop!

606
00:32:57,824 --> 00:33:00,426
Stop talking.
Stop listening.

607
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:03,463
There are only three things
that are real: you, me, and...

608
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:11,761
That.

609
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:13,429
Get up.
There are no straps.

610
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:15,064
This is not a hospital.

611
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,232
You are not crazy.

612
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:17,851
You can make it disappear.

613
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,269
Do it!

614
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:34,751
Quentin?

615
00:33:36,922 --> 00:33:39,956
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

616
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:41,341
Wait, you went here?

617
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:44,210
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

618
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:47,347
So, what, this is revenge?

619
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,798
When you're here for that long,

620
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,383
they can't just erase you.

621
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:52,051
They take you
into a special room

622
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:53,469
off the dean's office

623
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:56,439
and remove every memory
you make here.

624
00:33:56,474 --> 00:34:02,779
Every single magical thing
you learned amputated,

625
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:04,814
but those memories are stored.

626
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,372
Normally there's a shield
on this door

627
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,490
a hundred magicians
couldn't break.

628
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,876
Now...

629
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,331
Keep a lookout.

630
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:24,667
Wait, what's going--

631
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:31,960
It isn't working.
What happened?

632
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,868
I don't know.
I went there.

633
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,155
I told him,
the Matarese did his thing,

634
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,766
and then everything went black.

635
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:53,588
Hey.

636
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,173
He's not gonna wake up...

637
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:56,174
ever.

638
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,391
No, Marina
just has to--

639
00:34:57,427 --> 00:35:00,928
Marina is a psycho.

640
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:04,098
You were his friend.

641
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,600
It's her spell.
I can't--

642
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:08,269
No, I didn't sign up for this shit.

643
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:12,607
No, you have to go
reverse it now.

644
00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:02,490
Well, I can finally
reach you again,

645
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:05,243
but that's never been
the problem, has it--

646
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:06,623
my reaching you?

647
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:09,413
Will you please,
just for once--

648
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:11,549
no more riddles, okay?

649
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:13,501
Just tell me what to do.

650
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:16,053
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

651
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:17,505
You make the web you're in.

652
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,258
You're the spider and the fly,

653
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:22,009
just like...

654
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:31,435
Look, I can help.

655
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:32,987
I can give you the exact
wording of the spell.

656
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:34,438
It's too late.

657
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,073
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

658
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,074
Yeah, bullshit.
You did it to get even.

659
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:39,844
Oh, fuck you!
Somebody help him.

660
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,863
If I had the exact spell
wording one hour ago,--***

661
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:44,248
There's got to be something.

662
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:46,500
You have any idea
where he is right now?

663
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:48,002
Why would you do this?

664
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:49,870
She didn't.

665
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:52,423
Not by herself.
Did you?

666
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:00,514
You sure you want to play?

667
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,306
No. I'm not sure of anything.

668
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:12,059
Except I'm tired, so tired.

669
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:14,478
Of?

670
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:16,614
Fighting all the time,

671
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:18,199
becoming someone that
I actually want to be,

672
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:21,402
and then realizing that I...

673
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:24,622
am nothing.

674
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:26,490
So you made the hospital,

675
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:29,960
conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

676
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:32,163
Of course you're exhausted.

677
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:36,133
And you can hide
from it all forever

678
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,920
in this lovely, quiet,
blank void.

679
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:42,256
But you also built a way out.

680
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:45,259
Otherwise,
why are he and I here?

681
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:55,319
"The Madness Maker didn't
play for the joy of winning,

682
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,938
"just the fear of losing.

683
00:37:58,024 --> 00:38:00,658
"The real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

684
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:05,413
"which cut him off
from the surprise,

685
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:09,250
horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

686
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:16,924
"Jane saw only one way
out for him:

687
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:20,127
"stop playing.

688
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:23,130
Start living."

689
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:37,445
Hey.

690
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,562
Somebody woke up.

691
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,169
Took your damn time.

692
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,033
Somebody get him some brandy.

693
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,202
Flying in.

694
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,527
Wait.

695
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,029
Where's the hedge bitch?

696
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,749
Chop-chop.

697
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,083
They're going back up.

698
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:10,264
You should've told me your
friend wasn't properly erased.

699
00:39:10,384 --> 00:39:12,017
I know.

700
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:13,721
And you and Eliot
never should've taken on

701
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,055
the hedge witches alone.

702
00:39:15,107 --> 00:39:17,558
I know.

703
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:23,044
Quentin, do you really think
that the magic that we teach

704
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:27,952
means that you just get
to fly above right and wrong?

705
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:30,454
Magic does not solve problems.

706
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,666
It magnifies them.
I know that too.

707
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:34,208
Believe me.

708
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:37,326
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

709
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:40,212
I need to be taught magic

710
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:44,249
so that I can decide
what it is or isn't...

711
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:47,336
for me.

712
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:50,506
That was almost well put.

713
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:54,343
Good night, Quentin.

714
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:01,099
Oh, and Quentin...

715
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:04,353
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

716
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,359
Me too, actually.

717
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,618
Wow.

718
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:21,203
Wow.

719
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:28,126
I kind of can't believe
I ever thought I knew...

720
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:31,346
anything.

721
00:40:31,382 --> 00:40:33,382
I'd like to share now

722
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:37,386
some of it with some of you.

723
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,644
Ow!

724
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:54,453
Wait. Wait.

725
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,072
No. No.

726
00:40:57,157 --> 00:40:58,357
I didn't get you out of there

727
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:00,409
because you pulled one
over on me.

728
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:03,245
You and Kady bitched out,
but you'd talk.

729
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,416
She can't.

730
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:12,137
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

731
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:15,757
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

732
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,677
You don't know cut off.

733
00:41:18,762 --> 00:41:21,096
But, baby...

734
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,229
<i>You will.</i>

735
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:29,958
