<i>Previously on the magicians.</i>

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,360
<i>- Before i got here,</i>
<i>i was in the hospital.</i>

3
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:07,697
Quentin, i'd really
recommend further treatment.

4
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,066
Look, i've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else,

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,935
So you can't make me stay.

6
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,104
<i>- Brakebills is the first place</i>
<i>that feels right to me</i>

7
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:16,706
<i>That is not</i>
<i>literally a fairy tale.</i>

8
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,241
Quentin!

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,876
I made the mistake of
thinking you were just psychic.

10
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,878
Do you know
how to close your mind?

11
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,413
'cause i will
show you right now!

12
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,116
You are a traveler.

13
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:29,019
<i>- You can actually move</i>
<i>between worlds.</i>

14
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,957
Where are you going,
kitty cat?

15
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:35,292
I'm done here for good.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,227
You should be happy--
less competition.

17
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:41,865
Amateurs,</i>
<i>sad, and desperate people.</i>

18
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:45,135
That means level 50.
So you were--

19
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,704
Top witch in new york,
for starters.

20
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:51,241
Get me everything
on this list this week.

21
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,909
<i>- I don't know what</i>
<i>you're doing here, jules.</i>

22
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:54,411
<i>- Magic wasn't just</i>
<i>handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,446
People at brakebills, jules,
they can read minds.

24
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,882
They can fly.
You can do a party trick.

25
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,350
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:01,818
It's amazing i survived
as long as i did

27
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:05,889
Not knowing that
i was a magician.

28
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,357
I can't go back.

Dude, you're in the wrong--

32
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:18,361
Or i'm in the wrong, uh...

33
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:44,688
Hey! Big stuff.

34
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,823
Hey.
Got 'em? I'm dying.

35
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:48,692
Where are they?
Where are they?

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,926
Oh, jesus.

37
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,394
Where are they?
Cut it out.

38
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,964
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

39
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:58,868
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

40
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,171
Watercolors.

41
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,740
Without me, they're just--

42
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:08,278
Quentin, could i
speak to you?

43
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:12,682


44
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:16,019
Quentin?

45
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:17,320
<i>- Okay, this is</i>
<i>obviously a dream</i>

46
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,789
Where i realize
i'm in a dream.

47
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,124
So you think your life
is a dream?

48
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:22,225
No, my life is my life,

49
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,893
But this is like a--

50
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:25,161
This is the bad collage.

51
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,130
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

52
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,232
The brakebills--
it's all jumbled together.

53
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,201
So we're back
to brakebills?

54
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,435
Hopefully soon.

55
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,204
Where you think
you're a student

56
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,239
Studying to be a magician?

57
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:38,675
Okay, let's just
skip the part

58
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,977
Where you don't believe me,
okay?

59
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:44,247
Um, yeah,
it's a little chilly in here.

60
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:47,050
How about a miniature sun?

61
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,418
That'd be great.

62
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:57,193


63
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:05,101
I hate these dreams.

64
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,636
It's like your feet
are stuck to the floor

65
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,871
Or you're paralyzed.

66
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,639
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

67
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,108
You released me, remember,
in the real hospital?

68
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:13,877
I remember what i said.
What was it?

69
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:16,046
Uh, "you can't keep me here.

70
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:17,814
I haven't hurt myself
or anybody else."

71
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,049
You know that isn't true.

72
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:20,750
Well, none of this
is true,

73
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,220
But i said that to you
in real life before brakebills.

74
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:27,991
send him in.

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,326
Quentin, do you
remember why

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,395
The court ordered you
to be here?

77
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:35,965
The court? I don't...

78
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,201
If this is a trial dream,
i am--

79
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,437
God, these things
take forever.

80
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:42,272
Come in, penny.

81
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,041
Show me again what you found
in quentin's trash.

82
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,676
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

83
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,678
No. Hey,
it's okay, penny.

84
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,246
No one's in trouble.

85
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,322
Thank you, penny.

86
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,662
Quentin,

87
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:07,363
This is what happens when you
don't take what we prescribe.

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,133
You start to hallucinate again
that you're a magician,

89
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,334
You have powers.

90
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,369
It's all here--

91
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,040
Uh, the house of cards,
alice,

92
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:23,113
Eliot, margo,
the physical kids, the beast.

93
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:25,949
I know this can
all seem very real,

94
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,650
But it's not.

95
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,820
Brakebills
is the hallucination.

96
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,656
This is the reality.

97
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,658
You're seeing this, right?

98
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,694
You're very, very sick.

99
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,165
Are you not seeing this?

100
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,301
Oh, jesus.

101
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:50,907
I see you, quentin,
and i'm very, very worried.

102
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,277
Oh, okay.
They're gone.

103
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,045
The moths, they're--

104
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,314
They're gone.
There are no moths, quentin.

105
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:00,383
There never were.

106
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,120
Ah!

107
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,957
oh, i can't breathe.

108
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,897
Code red! Code red!
Main office!

109
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,948
Don't let them see.

110
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,119
I heard they shot you up.

111
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,822
I'm kind of foggy.

112
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,224
No, no, no.
Just focus on me, okay?

113
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:45,495
None of this is real.
Just us two.

114
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,330
And this.

115
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,634
Where are we?

116
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,003
I mean, what's going on?

117
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,739
You don't remember?

118
00:06:56,808 --> 00:07:00,610
I--i was at school,
i think, and...

119
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,478
And then i fell asleep
at a party,

120
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,482
And then i'm here

121
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,451
Where none of that
ever happened, and--

122
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,619
No, no, no, no,
no, no.

123
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:10,687
Oh, man.
No.

124
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,423
You came to find me.

125
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,124
I did?

126
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,260
To save me.

127
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,630
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

128
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,198
The illusion?

129
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,167
I crash-landed on this planet
9.3 light-years ago.

130
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,002
Alice?
Wait.

131
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,371
You're a starship captain,
and you came to rescue me.

132
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,273
I--uh, no.
Hang on.

133
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,841
But none of this is real.
It's--

134
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,145
We're trapped in a cage,
a menagerie.

135
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,814
Alice?

136
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:39,115
And they show us
these illusions

137
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:40,650
To make us fall
in love and mate.

138
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:45,488
Alice, that's enough.

139
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,557
Give them back.

140
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,626
What, dr. Fogg?
All of them, alice.

141
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:51,160
We need them for bridge.

142
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,196


143
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,499
They collect us
from all over the galaxy

144
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:57,867
To feed off our emotions.

145
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,302
No, that's not true.

146
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:00,904
It's an episode
of "lost in space."

147
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:01,971
"star trek."

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,339
What?

149
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:04,707
That's an episode
of "star trek."

150
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,578
It's an episode
of "star trek."

151
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,546
They finally got to you.

152
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,150
You belong to them now.

153
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,418
It's okay.

154
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,254
I'll still mate with you.

155
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,589


156
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:20,823
All right, that's enough.

157
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:22,692
Me three!
That's enough.

158
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,160
Me three.

159
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,597
[sighs,
clears throat]

160
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:32,535
Quentin, how are you?

161
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:37,173
Are you feeling
any better?

162
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,908
I guess.

163
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,410
Good.

164
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,414
Are you up for
seeing a visitor?

165
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,217

166
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:50,453
Hey, q.

167
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,425
I mean, yale's still
kind of a letdown--

168
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,460
Still, in the best way.

169
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,462
I mean, you would've--

170
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:03,132
Well, you--i mean, you will
totally agree, you know,

171
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,368
Once, you know,
it's you.

172
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,903
When what?
When i'm out?

173
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:08,738
It's just so much
easier than i--

174
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,306
Than we expected,
is all.

175
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:15,211
So you've been at yale
these last few months,

176
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,814
And i've been here?

177
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:19,649
You don't remember?

178
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:22,652
This? No.

179
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,787
Okay.

180
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,924
James is sorry
he couldn't make it tonight,

181
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:29,892
But he'll be by next week.

182
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:34,063
You know, we had
to lock down a church.

183
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,665
Church?

184
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,667
Mm-hmm.
For the wedding.

185
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:47,076
Are you engaged?

186
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,846


187
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:53,349
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

188
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,684
Seriously,
it doesn't even matter.

189
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,286
It's not important.

190
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:00,289
It's a spell.
A spell?

191
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:04,193
We're all trapped in it,
and i'm the only one who knows.

192
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:05,762
Okay, look.
I know that i just--

193
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,697
I sounded like alice
just then, but i'll--

194
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:13,036
Hey, um, i swear
i'm not crazy.

195
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:14,704
I want to understand,
okay?

196
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:15,938
I want to help you.
No.

197
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,474
Just tell me.
No. No.

198
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:22,011
no. Okay, i can do this.

199
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:30,953
<i></i>

200
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,324
Oh, god, look.

201
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:38,294
jules.

202
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:39,362
Jules, look.

203
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,963
Look.
Are you seeing this?

204
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:43,833
Look!

205
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,668
Are you guys--
are you not seeing this?

206
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:55,478
okay.

207
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:00,983
Don't...
What?

208
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,318
Look at me like that.
Q--

209
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:04,854
Don't feel sorry for me.
Do not.

210
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:08,157
I'm not me, and you're not you,
and this is not happening.

211
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:09,792
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

212
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,160
I'm not--i'm not here.

213
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,829
I am the one that
got into brakebills.

214
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,897
I'm in brakebills!
Hey, you!

215
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,667
Keep your voice down.

216
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:21,704
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, um...

217
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:23,239
Sorry.

218
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,681
Hey, i'm gonna go,
okay?

219
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,283
Um, i'll be back friday.

220
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,889
This can't be my life.

221
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,958
Jules, it can't be.

222
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,235
I wanted to see
the fireworks.

223
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,170
I really did.

224
00:11:56,774 --> 00:12:00,176
Wait.

225
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:03,079
How did you know
they were fireworks?

226
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,147
What?

227
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:05,381
If you couldn't see them,

228
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,116
How did you know
they were fireworks?

229
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,718
You told me.

230
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:12,755
I never said the word
"fireworks," julia.

231
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,160
What's going on here?

232
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,195


233
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,100
Okay, did nobody see that?

234
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:27,703
See what?
You laughing at me.

235
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:31,107
Laughing at you?

236
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,876
What kind of a friend
would do that?

237
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:36,212
Exactly.

238
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,350
Good-bye, quentin.

239
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,192
What?

240
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,500
All of them one by one.

241
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,636
Begin.

242
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:13,549
I believe you,
quentin.

243
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,685
You are a magician...

244
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,523
A very bad one.

245
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,132
You're always a raging dick.

246
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,113
ellsworth downs.

247
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,584
Ellsworth downs.

248
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,986
Ellsworth downs.

249
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:53,188
Ellsworth.

250
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:55,491
Ellsworth downs.

251
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,864
you know.

252
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,036
You know where to look,
quentin.

253
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:08,971
I can't show you.

254
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:12,141
I can't touch you.

255
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,777
It's very strong, this spell.

256
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,911
It is?

257
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:17,513
It is a spell?

258
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:20,749
It's in the book,
but the book is you.

259
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,551
This is all you.

260
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:24,553
Me?

261
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,655
<i></i>

262
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,857
Uh, which book?

263
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,559
Jane?

264
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,495
I can't remember what,
uh--

265
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:36,832
Jane, they gave me pills,
and i can't--i can't remember.

266
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:39,601
Jane.

267
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,140
<i> jane.</i>

268
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:55,984
No, no!

269
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,419
No, stop!
Stop it!

270
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:59,455
Stop! No!

271
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,156
The answer's in these books.

272
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:06,662
Jane said that these books are
my key to getting out of here.

273
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,498
Jesus.

274
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,134
Every time i talk,
i sound batshit.

275
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,803


276
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,878
Could i get some
tape anyplace?

277
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,546
Tape isn't permitted.

278
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:27,616
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, i know.

279
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,184
But why, again?

280
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,087
'cause you can harm
yourself or others.

281
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,555
It's tape.

282
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,457
That can strangle,
suffocate--

283
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:38,460
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

284
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,696
No one has
that kind of time.

285
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,564
I need to put these pages
back together.

286
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,466
You need to get
to music therapy.

287
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,071


288
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:53,075
Music is a way for us
to express and receive feeling

289
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,178
In a way that is safe and fun

290
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,714
And sometimes illuminating.

291
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,048
So who'd like to begin?

292
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,518
Oh, god,
please not that one song.

293
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:03,919
Ah, i'm sorry.

294
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:06,789
What was that, penny?

295
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:10,759
Oh, that one song,
please, no.

296
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,195
It gets in my head,
and it never leaves.

297
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,563
Oh, which song is that?

298
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,032
"michael rowed
the boat ashore."

299
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,935
#agree.

300
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,503
Everything here is me.

301
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,905
All right, everyone,

302
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,706
Why don't we kick it off
with the beatles?

303
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:27,643
"helter skelter."
helter skelter," please!

304
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,578
I was thinking
"here comes the"--

305
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,883
He's doing this because
i made him take his pills.

306
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,553
Enough! Dr. London?

307
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,919
Hey, penny, good luck
getting that out of your head.

308
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:55,264
<i>- Doctor...</i>
<i></i>

309
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:58,267
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, quentin.

310
00:17:58,302 --> 00:17:59,902
Look, i think i know
what's going on here,

311
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,904
And i think i know
how to get help.

312
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,839
Well, help is
why we're here.

313
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,173
No, it's not.

314
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,742
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're here

315
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:07,943
Because of a spell, and i need
to break the spell.

316
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:09,278
Quentin--

317
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:11,246
And if i can just reach
penny, the real penny,

318
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,615
And if--if i can get
inside of his head--

319
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,850
Enough.

320
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,718
That's enough.

321
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,993
Can i please
have some tape?

322
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,363
Do you remember the last time
you saw your father?

323
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,932


324
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,099
Dinner a few months ago.

325
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,301
Why?

326
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:41,410
Dad?

327
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:44,780
Hello, curly q.

328
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,382
I...

329
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,294
What happened
to your face?

330
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,830
Did you run
into a door or...

331
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:07,369
You did that, quentin.

332
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:09,237
I--

333
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,609
Come on.

334
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:15,677
It's time you see something.

335
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,951
<i>- Look, i'm telling you</i>
<i>it wasn't my dad.</i>

336
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,620
<i>It was the beast.</i>

337
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:27,389
<i>I never even touched him!</i>
<i>I used battle magic,</i>

338
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:29,391
<i>The same magic that i'm gonna</i>
<i>use to get out of here.</i>

339
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:33,962
<i>Are you ready?</i>
<i>Come on. Come on!</i>

340
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,931
<i></i>
<i>what did you do to my powers?</i>

341
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,266
<i>I need my powers.</i>
<i>The beast is here, okay?</i>

342
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,636
<i>He's coming for me.</i>
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

343
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,070
<i>He is coming to kill us.</i>

344
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:44,906
<i>You have got to give me</i>
<i>back my power!</i>

345
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:47,042
<i></i>

346
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:49,845
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

347
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,279
<i>Ahh!</i>

348
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:58,120
Do you remember
that night?

349
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,989
Um...

350
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:03,191
Your father does.

351
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,694
Tell him, ted.

352
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:07,129
He needs to hear it.

353
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:11,199
He needs to know the truth
why he's here.

354
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,935
We were having dinner
to celebrate

355
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:18,073
When you got into yale,
and...

356
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:19,741
In the middle
of the restaurant,

357
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:22,044
You suddenly said
there were moths everywhere.

358
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,412
No.

359
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,414
And then you started
calling me the beast.

360
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,315
Mm-mm.

361
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,217
You're lying.

362
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:30,886
And then you
picked up a knife.

363
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:33,088
Mm-mm. No.
I tried to stop you.

364
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:36,391
I grabbed you.
I tried to stop you from...

What?
From--from what?

366

You tried to kill
your father, quentin.

367

You need to stop fighting this
quentin.

368

I called you with the song.

Wednesday.

Am i asleep there

Man, i don't know
what you do at night,

420
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,034
And i don't want to know.

421
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,936
Where are you?
Trying to sleep.

422
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,070
This is not a dream.

423
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,572
It--it's a--

424
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,941
All of this,
it's a spell.

425
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,545
Please, listen.
Find me, okay?

426
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,813
Out there, find me.

427
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,851
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

428
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,384
Okay, you have to wake up.

429
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,919
Wake up.

430
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,387
Wake up. Wake up.

431
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,589
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!

00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,125
You, you will not
be shouting.

433
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,659
End it now, buster.

434
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,061
Wake the hell up!

435
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,433


436
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,037
Okay.

437
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,673
Good job.

Wow.

439
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:11,014
My whole body, every part
of my body, is tingling.

440
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,582
I mean, you didn't tell me
it would feel--

441
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,785
So good?

442
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,855
It's high-end, designer
cooperative magic.

443
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,159
It does something to your cells
to channel all that juice.

444
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,661
Everyone gets stronger.

445
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,464
Um, i just, um...

446
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:32,769
I didn't think q
would, uh, fall in so deep.

447
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,739
Oh, this is nothing.

448
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,742
Uh, what--
what does that mean?

449
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,610
Well, i mean he might want
to take his shoes off

450
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,978
And get comfortable.

451
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,580
We cooked up a whopper here.

452
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,782
I don't really see him
getting out of it,

453
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,651
Even with your
boyfriend's help.

454
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,958
Mm, i thought the idea
was to just mess with him.

455
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,862
My idea was
to fuÃ¡Ã¡ him up hard,

456
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:02,966
And you loved it
even harder.

457
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,468
Yeah, yeah, fuÃ¡Ã¡ him up,
not kill him.

458
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,870
Wait, what?
Kill him?

459
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,872
Oh, he's not gonna die.

460
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:12,709
He just might not actually
ever wake up.

461
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,644

462
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,913

limp on me here.

539
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,308
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

540
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,443
We need to summon
a matarese.

541
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,982
Quentin, i really thought
we were making progress.

542
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,917
I was wrong.

543
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:54,591
<i></i>

544
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,658
No.
What are you--

545
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,993
Lower the wards please.

546
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:08,371
Very good. And now the south
wards.

547
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:15,512
Dean fogg following
the playbook.

548
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,581
The only thing that can break
our spell on your ex-bff

549
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,886
Is a matarese--evil bug spirit
of the underworld.

550
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,454
About the only way
one of those can get

551
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,990
Into this sugary
wonderland

552
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,659
<i>Is to lower all the protective</i>
<i>wards and shields</i>

553
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:33,296
In the school, letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

554
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,869
Welcome back
to brakebills.

555
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,338
Let's go steal
their shit.

556
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,885
Careful.

557
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,693
Good.

558
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:07,230
<i>Daemonium matarese,</i>
<i>ecce vocavi</i>

559
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,699
<i>Te in carcere liberare</i>
<i>mens est.</i>

560
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,469
<i>Imperio scarlatti</i>
<i>telem nobus.</i>

561
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,638
That's the answer?

562
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,373
It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

563
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,642
Which should break him
out of the spell,

564
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,711
Which should bring him back,
halfway.

565
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Halfway?

566
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,749
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

567
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,718
The matarese breaks you
out of the prison,

568
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,955
But you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

569
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,958
And it is a lot easier
with a guide.

570
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,860
Penny, are you ready?

571
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,863

572
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,915

Quentin?

574

575
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,964
Quentin!
Answer me!

576
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,434
The problem is
in your frontal lobe, quentin.

577
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,938
Your emotions are
in complete control now,

578
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:26,376
Overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

579
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,810
So this...

580
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,814
Is inserted
into the eye socket.

581
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,449
No, no, no, no, no.

582
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,618
It's called
a transorbital lobotomy.

583
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,923
Dad.

584
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,926
Dad. Dad.

585
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,727
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

586
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,696
No, no, don't!

587
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:47,897
dad, don't!

588
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,443
Dad!

589
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:54,745
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

590
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:56,447
No, please, don't.
I didn't mean to, i swear.

591
00:32:56,515 --> 00:32:59,149
i'm sorry.
Hey, stop!

592
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:01,151
Stop talking.
Stop listening.

593
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,121
There are only three things
You, me, and...

594
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,191


595
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:12,696
That.

596
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:14,331
Get up.
There are no straps.

597
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,966
This is not a hospital.

598
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,134
You are not crazy.

599
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,769
You can make it
disappear.

600
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:20,170
Do it!

601
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:23,107
<i></i>

602
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:35,653
Quentin?

603
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,858
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

604
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:42,259
Wait, you went here?

605
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:45,129
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

606
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:48,265
So, what,
this is revenge?

607
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:49,700
When you're here
for that long,

608
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:51,301
They can't just erase you.

609
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,970
They take you
into a special room

610
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,371
Off the dean's office

611
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,341
And remove every memory
you make here.

612
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:03,681
Every single magical thing
you learned amputated,

613
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,749
But those memories are stored.

614
00:34:11,724 --> 00:34:13,290
Normally there's a shield
on this door

615
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,392
A hundred magicians
couldn't break.

616
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:17,795
Now...

617
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,232
Keep a lookout.

618
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:25,602
Wait, what's going--

619
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:27,604


620

What happened?

622
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:35,579
I don't know.
I went there.

623
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,781
I told him,
the matarese did his thing,

624
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,684
And then everything
went black.

625
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,265
Hey.

626
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:56,867
He's not gonna
wake up...

627
00:34:56,936 --> 00:34:57,868
Ever.

628
00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:59,069
No, marina
just has to--

629
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,639
Marina is a psycho.

630
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,776
You were his friend.

631
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:07,277
It's her spell.
I can't--

632
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:09,947
No, i didn't sign up
for this shit.

633
00:35:10,015 --> 00:35:14,318
No, you have to go
reverse it now.

Well, i can finally
reach you again,

638
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,937

the problem, has it--

My reaching you?

No more riddles, okay?

642
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:15,179
Just tell me what to do.

643
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:17,748
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

644
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:19,183
You make the web
you're in.

645
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,952
You're the spider
and the fly,

646
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:23,687
Just like...

647
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:33,130
Look, i can help.

648
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,665
I can give you the exact
wording of the spell.

649
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,133
It's too late.

650
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,768
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

651
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,837
Yeah, bullshit.
You did it to get even.

652
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,338
Oh, fuÃ¡Ã¡ you!
Somebody help him.

653
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,575
If i had the exact spell
wording one hour ago,--

654
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:45,943
There's got to be something.

655
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:48,178
You have any idea
where he is right now?

656
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,680
Why would you do this?

657
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:51,582
She didn't.

658
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,117
Not by herself.
Did you?

660
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,192
You sure you want to play?

00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,000
No. I'm not sure of anything.

662
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:13,737

so tired.

Fighting all the time,

665

Becoming someone that
i actually want to be,

666
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,080
And then realizing
that i...

667
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:26,316
am nothing.

668
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:28,185
So you made the hospital,

669
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:31,655
Conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

670
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:33,857
Of course you're exhausted.

671
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:37,828
And you can hide
from it all forever

672
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:41,632
In this lovely, quiet,
blank void.

673
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,967
But you also built
a way out.

674
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:46,937
Otherwise,
why are he and i here?

675
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:57,014
"the madness maker didn't
play for the joy of winning,

676
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:59,650
"just the fear of losing.

677
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:02,352
"the real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

678

"which cut him off
from the surprise,

679
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,928
Horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

"jane saw only one way

"stop playing.

00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:24,841
Start living."

683
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:29,579


684
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:35,886

00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:37,087


686
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,122
Hey.

687
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,257
Somebody woke up.

688
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:41,792
Took your damn time.

689
00:38:42,995 --> 00:38:44,728
Somebody get him
some brandy.

690
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,897
Flying in.

691
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:52,336
Wait.

00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:54,871
Where's the hedge bitch?

Chop-chop.

694
00:38:57,643 --> 00:38:58,909
They're going back up.

695
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,131
You should've told me your
friend wasn't properly erased.

696
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,467
I know.

697
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:15,768
And you and eliot
never should've taken on

698
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,070
The hedge witches alone.

699
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,606
I know.

700
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:24,544
Quentin, do you really think
that the magic that we teach

701
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:29,983
Means that you just get
to fly above right and wrong?

702
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:32,485
Magic does not
solve problems.

703
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:34,153
It magnifies them.
I know that too.

704
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,222
Believe me.

705
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,791
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

706
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,661
I need to be taught magic

707
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,698
So that i can decide
what it is or isn't...

708
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:48,768
For me.

709
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:51,971
That was almost well put.

710
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,808
Good night, quentin.

711
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:02,548
Oh, and quentin...

712
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:05,785
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

713
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:11,791
Me too, actually.

714
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:18,898


715
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,067
Wow.

716
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:22,635
Wow.

717
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:29,575
I kind of can't believe
i ever thought i knew...

718
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:32,779
Anything.

719
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,814
I'd like to share now

720
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:38,851
