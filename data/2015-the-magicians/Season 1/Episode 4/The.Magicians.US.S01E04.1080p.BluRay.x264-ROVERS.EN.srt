That's something.

525
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,994
Let me try.

526
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,759

what all this is for?

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,392
I did. Bigger,
better magic.

mentioned how.

I guess I could
tell you now.

like it. Later, maybe?

537

That's a growing
possibility.

Yes, I thought so.

the Scarlatti Web.

We cannot break it.
No one can.

Wait, he's not gonna
wake up ever?

543

I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

544
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,511
We need to summon
the Matarese.

we were making progress.

About the only way

into this sugary wonderland

It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

562

which should break
him out of this spell,

563
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,118
which should bring
him back, halfway.

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,635
Halfway?

565
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,350
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

566
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,113
The Matarese breaks
you out of the prison,

567
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,392
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

568
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,393

easier with a guide.

Good night, Quentin.

698
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,999
Oh, and Quentin,

699
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,830
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

700
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,637
Me, too, actually.

701
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,672
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

702
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,869
Wow. (SIGHS)

703
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,519
WOW. (LAUGHING)

704
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,673
I kind of can't believe
lever thought I knew

705
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,239
anything. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,799
I'd like to share now,
some of it with
some of you.

707
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,510
(SCREAMING)

708
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,910
(GASPING)

709
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,238
(GASPING)

710
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,317
Wait. Wait. No. No.

711
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,597
I didn't get you out
of there because you
pulled one over on me.

712
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,559
You and Kady bitched
out, but you'd talk.

713
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,200
She can't. (CHUCKLES)

714
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,349
Oh, poor you and
your taste of honey
worse than none at all.

715
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,353
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

716
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,396
You don't know "cut off."

717
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,879
But, baby...

718
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,959
(WHOOSHING)

719
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,239
<i>You Will.</i>
