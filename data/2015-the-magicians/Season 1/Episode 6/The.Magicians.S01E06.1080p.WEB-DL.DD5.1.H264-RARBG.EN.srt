1
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:03,323
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,324 --> 00:00:04,861
I knew The Beast would come.

3
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:07,788
Get strong, learn fast,
any means is necessary.

4
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,825
So that's it? That's all
you're gonna say to me?

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,260
I got into the school
and you didn't.

6
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:12,755
I don't know what else to say.

7
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,626
Marina is a psycho.

8
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,665
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

9
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:19,839
You don't know cut off.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,570
Now the spells are missing
so I can keep going.

11
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,065
I want the new ones
that she stole.

12
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,406
They're locked
in the filing cabinet.

13
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,280
- You are a traveler.
- You can move between worlds.

14
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,419
Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,547
It works by binding your body
to Earth.

16
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:35,493
<i>Won't make the voices go away,
but it might keep you alive.</i>

17
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,485
All I can say is
it was some kind of dungeon.

18
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,134
This was in the walls.

19
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:52,296
Penny, I think you were
in Fillory.

20
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:57,510
You were in Fillory.

21
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,679
- You were in Fillory...
- Stop!

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,948
- Okay? Fillory is just a...
- Did you see any animals?

23
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:02,748
- Did they talk to you?
- I was at some dungeon,

24
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:04,149
you Hobbit-loving freak.

25
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,251
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:06,422
There are no Hobbits in Fillory.

27
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:07,750
It... It doesn't matter.

28
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,424
Ah, the drawing, the crest,
it means that you were

29
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:10,961
in a certain Fillorian castle.

30
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:13,088
- Kill me.
- It was built by dwarves.

31
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:15,293
Ah, okay, let's not get
caught up in the details.

32
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:18,725
The... the point is that
the... it's full of a...

33
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:20,602
a ton of incredibly
magical shit.

34
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:22,701
Oh, yeah, The Beast
is really fucking magical.

35
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,803
Let me pop back over there

36
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,304
and see if he does
birthday parties.

37
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,606
Let's go.
It's a waste of time.

38
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:30,509
I think you should listen
to Quentin.

39
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,141
Because I'm assuming
you didn't travel to Fillory

40
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:35,375
on some planned vacation.

41
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:37,422
So you don't know
how to control it yet.

42
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:39,647
Then educate yourself.

43
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:42,989
Nobody knows more about Fillory
than Quentin.

44
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,590
What if you end up back
there again?

45
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:46,791
She makes a point.

46
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,797
Okay, fanboy.

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,429
Tell me what it says
in the books

48
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,274
about not getting my face
eaten by The Beast.

49
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,406
The Beast isn't in the books.

50
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,367
How's that, if I was right
there staring him in the face?

51
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:04,206
The Chatwins, they mostly
get chased around

52
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,141
by this Time Witch,
the Watcher Woman.

53
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:09,276
She plants clocks in trees.

54
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,050
Ah, it's sort of surrealist.

55
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,819
Okay, I take it back.
This is a waste of your time.

56
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,987
The books were written for kids,

57
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:15,317
so maybe they skipped
the monster

58
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:16,822
that rips out people's eyes.

59
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:19,191
- I don't know!
- Okay.

60
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:20,626
We're done here.

61
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:23,496
You love Fillory so much,
I hope you get to go.

62
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:24,797
I really do.

63
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,705
I guess I've been trying
to convince myself that

64
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,511
Penny's somehow
wrong about Fillory

65
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:42,613
despite having
actually been there.

66
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,346
That's a pretty acrobatic
form of denial.

67
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:50,690
I really am sorry.

68
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,731
I'm sure Fillory got you
through a lot as a kid.

69
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,987
Yeah.

70
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:58,296
As a kid...

71
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,933
Sorry, the manager
isn't in right now.

72
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,695
Would you like
to place an order?

73
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,604
I know you know who I am.

74
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:07,606
Look, I'm sorry
I insulted you guys.

75
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:11,377
But just who talked to you?
Marina? Pete?

76
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:12,838
I'm going to call the cops.

77
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:14,946
God, Rick, grow a pair!

78
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,378
Wait, wait, wait.

79
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:17,783
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:19,418
Please.

81
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:22,549
I don't know anyone else.

82
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:30,502
I'm not done with you.

83
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:34,796
Consider it as a warning.

84
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:44,777
Julia.

85
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:48,547
Julia, wait.
Just, just, wait.

86
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,478
Marina, okay?

87
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,251
No one wants a war.

88
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:55,621
Here.

89
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:57,590
It's about an hour by train.

90
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:59,161
Went there couple years back.

91
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:02,459
They're real.
They are good.

92
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,902
Just give them a try, but...

93
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:08,427
Please, don't come
back here again.

94
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:22,750
How'd you learn all this anyway?

95
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,219
Me and a friend got deep
into ink spells in high school.

96
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,291
It's not the Mona Lisa, but...

97
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,019
I do have 20/20 vision
in the dark.

98
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,928
And where was all this exactly?

99
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,099
I told you.

100
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,830
I'm basically from the 'burbs.

101
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,665
Actually, you never say
a damn thing about your life.

102
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,870
'Cause it's boring.

103
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:49,314
What flavor of boring?

104
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,746
My mom died young.

105
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:56,108
And...

106
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:59,716
My dad is kind of embarrassing.

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,560
He wears Birkenstocks
and he sells weed.

108
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:07,888
But he loves me no matter
what kind of trouble I get in.

109
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,730
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

110
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:13,771
So, this symbol, it do anything
for the mind slut shit?

111
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:18,702
Yeah, you know,
Brakebills is good.

112
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:20,405
Everyone knows how to pull
their blinds down, you know?

113
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,837
Yeah.

114
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:25,711
I still hear her, though.

115
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:28,012
That girl from the dungeon...

116
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:30,683
I can't shut her out.

117
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,351
I just file that under

118
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:35,921
"Wish there was jack shit
I could do about it."

119
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:36,956
Yeah.

120
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:39,117
Or were you talking
about The Beast?

121
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:42,626
If I was you, I'd be curious.

122
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,929
He's full-on AWOL,
not a peep.

123
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,932
So, I get this,

124
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:50,436
and I don't poke the bear.

125
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:54,067
Let's just hope the bear
has better shit to do.

126
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:21,795
Shit, shit, shit.

127
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,251
Hey!

128
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,260
Why are you following me, lady?

129
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,258
Easy.
I just want to show you.

130
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,297
I'm just like you.

131
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,951
Hello?

132
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:21,261
Is someone being creepy
on purpose?

133
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,940
Secure the sacrifice!

134
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,442
Oh, God damn it. No!

135
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,616
Oh, Manon!

136
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,390
We offer up this virgin.

137
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,458
Flesh and blood.

138
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,259
Jesus, I'm not a virgin.

139
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:30,529
Huh.

140
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,930
Life is full of surprises.

141
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:33,101
What the hell, Margo?

142
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:35,069
Follow, follow.
Hurry, hurry.

143
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,539
Ow. Guys, the pine needles
are hurting my feet.

144
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,070
Shh.

145
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:48,477
Ow, ow.

146
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:04,697
Hello, first years.

147
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:07,198
At this appointed hour,

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,300
as tradition dictates,

149
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,942
it falls upon the upper class

150
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:15,937
to administer what is known
simply as "The Trials."

151
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,647
The Trials test your ability

152
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,187
to think and act
like a Magician.

153
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:32,288
Pass, your journey begins.

154
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:36,829
Fail, you flunk out.

155
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,499
This is a test engineered
to thin out the herd.

156
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,340
Only those who should
will survive.

157
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,039
Oh, nut up, this isn't Harvard.

158
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,741
It requires actual effort.

159
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:53,343
And don't bother to go
complaining to the faculty.

160
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:55,676
They're off
on a luxurious retreat,

161
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,582
observing from a distance.

162
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:01,487
You are ours, miscreants.

163
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,818
Onward to glory!

164
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:06,692
Come on. Go!

165
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:09,061
Go!

166
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,562
- Move, move, move!
- Hurry up.

167
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,838
Name, please.

168
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:25,343
Alice Quinn.

169
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,345
Hmm.

170
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:29,407
Let me see.

171
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,976
Alice Quinn.

172
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,675
Wow, you're really enjoying
this aren't you?

173
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:36,686
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

174
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:39,558
The Trials themselves
have the power, Alice.

175
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,089
They will pass or fail you
as the Dean created them to.

176
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:46,196
I merely keep a little eye
on each and everyone of you.

177
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:50,903
Ah, there you are.

178
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:54,740
Report to the table
on your placard.

179
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:58,110
Good luck.

180
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,111
Next!

181
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,847
Say one word about Fillory
and I'll kill you.

182
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:11,056
Don't get me kicked out.

183
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,557
Well, then we'd finally be even.

184
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,689
Now I get it.

185
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,127
Get what?

186
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:17,698
Why our team name is
"Horny Chupacabras."

187
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,957
I'm not a...

188
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,896
I don't even know
what a "chupacabra" is.

189
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:23,601
It's a spine-covered
goat-sucking primate

190
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,203
indigenous to Mexico.

191
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:27,265
I can already see
we are immensely handicapped

192
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:28,640
by your presence.

193
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:33,037
In 18th century England,

194
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:36,306
a secret society
known as "The Brethren"

195
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:41,646
encrypted hundreds of spells
to hide them from the church.

196
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:43,654
You may open your blue books.

197
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:49,828
Each team must decode and cast
their spell by 9:00 a.m.

198
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,997
Screw up,

199
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,558
and it's back to page one.

200
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,096
FYI, this test
is pretty much impossible.

201
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:57,536
Begin!

202
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:09,275
Back in the day,
we'd travel the world.

203
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:11,016
We'd pay for spells,

204
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,777
trade for 'em.

205
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:16,585
And they weren't all the most
ambitious Hedges you ever saw,

206
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,057
but we looked out
for each other.

207
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,758
It was like family.

208
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,660
First family I really felt
I belonged in, actually.

209
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,067
Okay, so what do you
want exactly?

210
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,969
Well...

211
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:35,707
You know, our story with Marina,
it's not rare.

212
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,577
I have seen her chew people up
and spit them out.

213
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:41,078
Then what? You swoop in,
you buy us a milkshake?

214
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,548
Come on.

215
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,118
Not till today.

216
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:50,556
You are the first I believe
can really do things,

217
00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:52,887
if...

218
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:56,392
given the opportunity to learn.

219
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:59,256
I mean, I can feel it
coming off you.

220
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,395
You're not an amateur.

221
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,001
You're the real thing.

222
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:09,235
Yeah, well,
some think so, some do not.

223
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:12,942
Well, I think
we can help each other.

224
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:14,606
How?

225
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:20,245
It's not much,

226
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:22,353
but, you know, they'll be
new to you, I think.

227
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:24,655
Wait a minute.

228
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:26,257
- How did you...
- All over.

229
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,129
- Where did you...
- You don't want to know.

230
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,228
But you're welcome to 'em.

231
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:32,931
In exchange for what?

232
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,502
Just do some with me.

233
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,800
I miss the feeling, you know.

234
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:52,652
Welcome...
à la Safe House Julia.

235
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,329
Can you make it colder?

236
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,296
Girl, you're strong!

237
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:18,910
Shit.

238
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,241
Was this the last of them?

239
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:22,676
I'm afraid so.

240
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:31,757
Well, hey, we'll hit the road.

241
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:33,988
Right? Find new stuff.

242
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:36,028
Try, at least.

243
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,997
But you know who has
a ton of new stuff?

244
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:41,098
Marina.

245
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,037
'Cause she got
her memories back.

246
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:46,238
I helped her do it.

247
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,839
She has...

248
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,109
Brakebills.

249
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,380
So she has everything.

250
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,080
We're screwed.

251
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,285
How much time do we have left?

252
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:01,586
I don't know.

253
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,087
Who knows how to read
an hourglass?

254
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,589
This is impossible.

255
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,590
Even Eliot said
it was impossible.

256
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:10,061
Wait, it's impossible.

257
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,301
Actually he said, it was
practically impossible.

258
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,958
But maybe some genius
can do this.

259
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:16,126
So what?
Geniuses can be magicians?

260
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:18,795
- Yeah.
- Really?

261
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:21,065
We have to cheat.

262
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,414
They want us to.
We've been Kobayashi Maru'd.

263
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:25,109
Whatever that means, yes.

264
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,779
- No. No way.
- You're an idiot.

265
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,880
- We're cheating.
- Why would...

266
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:32,382
Why would they want us to cheat?

267
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:34,215
Because we're magicians.

268
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,750
No. No.

269
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:37,145
They're just want to see
how far we can get.

270
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:40,416
There is no such a thing
as half a spell.

271
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:42,986
You guys are insane.

272
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:45,625
Supply closet.

273
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:47,899
Five minutes.

274
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,630
I've got a plan.

275
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:54,769
Oh, man.

276
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:57,644
They really upped
the security since my day.

277
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:59,643
How much do you know
about those wards?

278
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,245
Enough to know they're strong.

279
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,107
But not enough
to break them, so...

280
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,676
What do you think would happen
if we just ran in there

281
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:05,684
and grabbed the filing cabinet?

282
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:08,345
Oh, yeah, sure.

283
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:09,824
You ever see the movie
"Scanners"?

284
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,857
Oh.

285
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,288
There's a way.

286
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,292
There's always a way.

287
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:22,332
Do you have a pen?

288
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,025
Here.

289
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:29,305
Mm, what we need...

290
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:31,438
Think of it like a fishhook.

291
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:33,213
We grab the cabinets
from the room,

292
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,650
without tripping wards.

293
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,777
There's wards all over the room.

294
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,183
Yeah, in this dimension, sure.

295
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:42,185
The one thing I can't figure out
is how to get the hook in.

296
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:46,057
You know, we need someone
inside for that.

297
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:49,227
And I sort of burned
all my bridges with that.

298
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:52,228
You think we can pay
someone off?

299
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:54,900
No.

300
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:57,871
I know someone.

301
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,711
Okay, here is the question.

302
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:08,212
Do you believe
what you said earlier,

303
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:09,582
that a genius could solve
this by dawn?

304
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,782
Well yeah, I mean,
if they were...

305
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:12,918
Alice Quinn?

306
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,486
If anyone, she could.

307
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:16,187
Can you read her mind?

308
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,719
No.

309
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:20,459
Unlike you, she's airtight.

310
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,627
But I can do one better.

311
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,846
Just light the fucking thing.

312
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,626
Nicely done.

313
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:29,627
Perfect execution.

314
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,297
Too bad I know you cheated.

315
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:39,136
Congratulations, you two,

316
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,706
and on to the second trial.

317
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:45,837
Well, what about...

318
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,245
Thinning the herd.

319
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:00,462
So, are you gonna tell me
who we're meeting?

320
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,959
Yeah, she... she's not
a hedge witch exactly.

321
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:05,162
Well, her and I have
some history.

322
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:06,164
So, I think...

323
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,365
What do you mean by "history"?

324
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,826
Hey, chickadee.

325
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,074
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

326
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,969
Ah, this is your daughter.

327
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:14,639
What's she doing here?

328
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,907
She's a friend.

329
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:18,378
Okay, come on, babe, please.
Sit.

330
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:24,577
How are you?
How you've been?

331
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:27,084
Just tell me what you want, Mom.

332
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,486
I want to give you something.

333
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,047
Oh, that's so sweet.

334
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,256
Yeah, my birthday
was seven months ago.

335
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,488
Kady, look, I was not
in a good place

336
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:37,733
the last time you saw me,
but my shit's together now.

337
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,059
Oh, is it?

338
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:40,495
Is that why you're hanging out

339
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,199
with the angriest bitch
from the safe house?

340
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:44,871
Oh, if you want to insult me,
try again.

341
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,500
Just...

342
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:49,335
Listen.

343
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:52,580
I called because Julia and I
have a line on something.

344
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,448
Oh, my God, here we go again.

345
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:57,377
We're gonna start our own house.

346
00:19:57,383 --> 00:20:01,219
Nothing crazy,
but it'll be safe...

347
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,188
from Marina.

348
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,589
So come with us.

349
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,459
Oh, my God, you're insane.

350
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,729
You actually think
that you can beat her.

351
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,900
Hey, Marina's strong,
but so are we.

352
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,108
Nothing like that
at school, huh?

353
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:25,239
Protection charm.

354
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:28,246
It'll render a house
literally invisible.

355
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,447
You know, the amazing thing

356
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:34,619
is you actually believe
that this plan could work.

357
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,589
Marina will never let me go.

358
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,820
Ever.

359
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:43,626
Oh, did Hannah give you
the whole sob history?

360
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:44,959
- Kady.
- No, no.

361
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,832
Marina didn't betray my mom.
She cleaned up her mess.

362
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,033
Yeah, Hannah, she wanted
to steal something.

363
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:50,365
Big heist, right?

364
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:52,399
Except she can't handle
her shit under pressure

365
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:55,235
and two people died.

366
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,241
Cut to now,
Marina gets to demand that

367
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:59,142
I steal shit ten times a week.

368
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,375
Yeah, no big.

369
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:06,449
Don't call me again.

370
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:08,192
- Hey, you can't take that.
- Let her have it.

371
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,647
- No, we need it.
- So does she.

372
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:12,416
If I had more,

373
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:14,555
I'd give you more.

374
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:17,858
Yeah.

375
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:19,303
But you don't.

376
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,904
You sold your daughter
to Marina?

377
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,871
No.
Marina stole her.

378
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,610
Yeah, because of a really
bad judgment call that<i> you</i> made.

379
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:32,438
She said she had my back.
This is not black and white.

380
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:34,705
Yeah, well, Kady sure seems
to think that it is.

381
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:36,084
If this goes how we want,

382
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:37,351
I can fix that too.

383
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:38,719
If this...
Do you hear yours...

384
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,948
"If this works out"?
I'm out.

385
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:41,022
Oh, no, you don't.

386
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,550
You do not cut me off.

387
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:45,355
My daughter just got brought
into this.

388
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:48,727
And I will share with you
everything I can.

389
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:52,197
But it is better that
I see this through alone.

390
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,478
This looks like a home brew.

391
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,046
Where did you get it?

392
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,147
Found it inside an old textbook.

393
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,418
It looks underwhelming.

394
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,088
So how's Professor March's
research going?

395
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:20,319
Look, I tried, but he won't
take on first year assistants.

396
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:21,986
Well, you're just his type.

397
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:24,864
So I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

398
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:41,249
"But where is the door, Martin?

399
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,007
"There is always a door
to Fillory

400
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:44,815
"when we really need it,

401
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:47,277
"in the clock or the closet...

402
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:50,646
or my panties..."

403
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:52,916
Come on, celebrate.

404
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,655
You passed, you dirty cheater.

405
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,790
What's the problem?

406
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:58,296
Speak.

407
00:22:58,297 --> 00:23:01,027
No offense,
you're just not exactly...

408
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,167
Warm and cuddly?

409
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,598
I know.

410
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:06,473
You ever want something so badly

411
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,872
and then realize that it's
nothing like what you thought?

412
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:11,109
And maybe that you are stupid

413
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,540
for ever actually
even wanting it.

414
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:14,645
Every guy I've ever slept with.

415
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:16,007
Fillory is real.

416
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:17,445
Oh, come on.

417
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:19,449
It is.

418
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:20,881
Penny is a traveler.

419
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:21,946
And he went there.

420
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,621
And...

421
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:25,490
it's real.

422
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,231
You look like your head's
about to pop off.

423
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,457
I loved those books.

424
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:33,462
- You did?
- Why so surprised?

425
00:23:33,465 --> 00:23:37,395
I'd pretend I was Ambassador
to the Fillorian Outer Islands.

426
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:40,538
But the real thing,
it's not like the story.

427
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:45,076
So, what, it's actually
totally shitty over there?

428
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,977
I don't know.
Maybe.

429
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:48,979
Yes.

430
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,349
At least a little.

431
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,380
The thing that attacked us
that ripped the Dean's eyes out,

432
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:58,816
seems like it might be
from Fillory.

433
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:00,658
Jesus.

434
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,659
That is not tonally consistent
with the books.

435
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:04,962
No, it's not.

436
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:06,698
And that...
I just... I...

437
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,867
I find that...

438
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:10,368
devastating.

439
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,537
Were you planning a trip there?

440
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,468
No. Really.

441
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:17,143
Because, otherwise,
you're literally

442
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,582
torturing yourself
over a fairy tale.

443
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,714
Quentin,
you passed the first trial.

444
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,246
You live to fight another day.
Drink up.

445
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:28,822
Go to the party.
Find someone to bang.

446
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:32,056
Celebrate the world you're in,
dummy.

447
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,987
Come on!

448
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:38,725
Okay.

449
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,931
Wow, I'm a little...

450
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,736
I am very...

451
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:47,867
Wow, I'm really, ah...

452
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:49,673
Margo, did you roofie me?

453
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:18,569
Can we just skip down
to where you realize

454
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,370
you no makey magic here?

455
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:25,438
Oh, cucumber.

456
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:27,879
Daddy's favorite.

457
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,516
And too much dill.

458
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,477
There they all are.

459
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:36,645
All those little fishies,
just like us.

460
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:41,085
Eating, shitting, breeding.

461
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:44,393
I require one.

462
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:45,826
It's over there.

463
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,131
Chop, chop.

464
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:50,432
I am literally losing
the will to live.

465
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:51,666
So, this is my next test?

466
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,338
I'm supposed to...

467
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,906
spear a fish?

468
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:57,637
Do your lips move when you read?

469
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:07,654
Seriously? One arrow?

470
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,518
Eliot!

471
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,049
Bring him to me.

472
00:26:42,054 --> 00:26:43,721
Why?

473
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:47,558
I want to get
my Catherine the Great on.

474
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,189
Google it.

475
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,962
Totally hilarious.

476
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:54,403
Oh, and to help you out...

477
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:57,098
No.

478
00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:59,202
Just no.
Okay?

479
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:01,174
Okay.

480
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:03,767
Wait.

481
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,336
I'm seeing your future now.

482
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:08,975
Gay porn?

483
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,218
Oh, my <i>favorito</i>.

484
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:21,359
Liver.

485
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:46,217
Julia!
Julia, stop.

486
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:47,378
You're gonna blow yourself up.

487
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:48,386
I was getting it.

488
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:50,817
You really weren't, hon.

489
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:51,993
How did you get in?

490
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:54,520
I unpicked your ward.

491
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:57,586
I would go with
Koyosegi next time.

492
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,656
Thank you for the advice.
Now, can you please leave?

493
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,695
We already agreed that
we're not partners, okay?

494
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,800
Well, it didn't work.

495
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:05,972
Because you need
ten extra digits.

496
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:09,207
Actually, I don't.
I...

497
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,508
It's interesting
how you can't look at me.

498
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,779
You know why?

499
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,250
'Cause I'm too familiar.

500
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:22,385
I mean, we both made mistakes,
we live with them,

501
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:26,357
we go on, alone, if we have to.

502
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:28,326
But you do this alone,

503
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:31,627
and you will get hurt.

504
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:34,866
Come on.

505
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,067
We can help each other out.

506
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:41,001
Please.

507
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:46,575
I want my daughter back.

508
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,690
Kady?

509
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:01,192
Kady.
Hey, Kady.

510
00:29:01,193 --> 00:29:02,533
- Kady, Kady.
- Stop it, stop it.

511
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,588
- Stop it. Let go, let go.
- Hey, no, no.

512
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:06,156
- I have to catch the bird.
- Hey.

513
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,825
This shit is dumb.
The school is not worth it.

514
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,174
No, I can't, you don't get it.

515
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:11,936
I can't get kicked out.

516
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:13,437
Oh, fuck!

517
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:14,598
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

518
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:16,066
- Jesus.
- Is it broken?

519
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:17,274
I don't know.

520
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:19,606
Ow!
Let me see, let me see.

521
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:21,241
- Ow.
- Let me look at it.

522
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:22,506
- It's not broken.
- Look, talk to me.

523
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:24,382
What's going on?

524
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:26,783
Look, it's just...

525
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:28,685
This is all I have.

526
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:31,587
Me too.

527
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,160
No, it's different.

528
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:36,928
I'm different.

529
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:39,499
Look, I need Brakebills.

530
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:45,797
It's life or death.
I have to be here.

531
00:30:01,253 --> 00:30:03,023
Hey, what are you supposed
to get with that?

532
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:06,821
A pheasant.

533
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:11,086
- You?
- A horse.

534
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,656
These people are crazy.

535
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:18,836
Let's go find the others.

536
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:21,867
Come on.

537
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,010
Yo!

538
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,446
Whoa!

539
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:31,345
Seriously, dude,
I almost had him.

540
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,180
We'll get him, son.

541
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:38,915
It's not about magic,
'cause it's about

542
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,759
talking to each other.

543
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,690
All right, you got that.

544
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:45,295
But I grew up in Florida,

545
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:49,097
so I actually know how to use it
to get your fish.

546
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:51,301
But I'm after a horse.

547
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,535
- Seriously?
- What?

548
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,669
Junior Cowboy Camp.

549
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:59,976
Pheasant.

550
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:05,218
Tree.

551
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,537
You're bleeding.

552
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,612
I hated Junior Cowboy Camp.

553
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:36,875
Timber!

554
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:41,545
Bravo!

555
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,387
Brava!
Brava.

556
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:45,818
That's it, we passed.

557
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:48,592
After you chop the tree
into firewood,

558
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:50,433
whip us up
a little grilled salmon...

559
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,759
Some honeyed pheasant.

560
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:55,704
And take turns
blowing the horse.

561
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:21,557
Did you see the look
on Quentin's face?

562
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,860
Like, "Fine,
but I am not going first."

563
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:30,368
I'm sure by now you've
realised Brakebills

564
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:33,537
teaches us to be arch
and ironic about magic.

565
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,368
But this one plays it serious.

566
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,435
You must bare yourself

567
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:40,813
in the presence
of another magical adept

568
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:46,817
and expose your highest
governing internal circumstance,

569
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:48,886
which is to say,

570
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:52,656
your utmost truth.

571
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,857
You have till midnight.

572
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,660
Ready?

573
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,700
Oh, shit!

574
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:48,411
Shit.

575
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,447
No!

576
00:34:13,572 --> 00:34:16,040
Okay, it's a two person spell.

577
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:20,110
Both must succeed to unlock it.

578
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,451
You bind your hands
with this rope.

579
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:25,416
How am I gonna survive?

580
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,077
It'll fall off once
you've reached transcendence.

581
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:29,916
It's gotta be some kind
of scheme, right?

582
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:32,089
To record us playing
naked truth or dare,

583
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,590
so they can blackmail us
or something.

584
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:36,260
Unfortunately,
Margo wasn't lying.

585
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:40,498
It's arcane
and a bit unorthodox,

586
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:44,268
but secrets magic
is a real thing.

587
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:47,969
Basically, there is no trick
or cheat to this.

588
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:50,773
It's kind of the exact opposite.

589
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,860
Focus.

590
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:15,965
I'm trying.

591
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:26,408
All clear.
Good to go.

592
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,050
Hey.

593
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:40,022
Oh, my God.

594
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:41,885
Oh, my God, no.

595
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:50,399
Run.

596
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:51,669
Hannah.

597
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,670
Hannah!

598
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,701
You... you said it was all clear.

599
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:56,066
You said it was gonna be okay.

600
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:58,409
Run!
Marina is coming.

601
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,010
We need to get help.
We need to get help.

602
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:02,980
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

603
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:22,930
You know,
it's not part of the spell,

604
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:26,002
but I think it could
make things easier.

605
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:30,339
You know, I always thought
when...

606
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:33,010
I partook in a nude
magic ritual,

607
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:37,751
that I'd be sort of
in a mystical trance.

608
00:36:41,186 --> 00:36:43,086
Tell that to the girl
who lost her virginity

609
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:45,688
with all her clothes on.

610
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:50,527
Okay.

611
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,092
Okay.

612
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:57,528
Okay.

613
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:00,329
Ah...

614
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:03,671
I've been institutionalized
more than once.

615
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:11,971
Maybe we shouldn't drink.

616
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:15,376
Or we should drink more.

617
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,316
Yeah.

618
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:20,977
William.

619
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:22,445
Really?

620
00:38:22,454 --> 00:38:24,221
Ask me something harder

621
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:27,157
if you want us to get somewhere.

622
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:36,226
Ask me why I'm nice to you.

623
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:39,974
I had noticed you're a tad
brusque with everyone else.

624
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:43,640
And why is that?

625
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:46,280
Penny, you don't have to.

626
00:38:46,281 --> 00:38:48,407
Look, I'm not...
scared to tell you this

627
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,913
because it's true.

628
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,476
Shit!

629
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,086
Okay.

630
00:38:57,088 --> 00:38:59,218
Truth.

631
00:38:59,224 --> 00:39:01,291
I am scared to tell you this,

632
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,332
because it's true.

633
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:09,032
I'm falling in love with you.

634
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,637
I-I can't do this.

635
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:15,138
I can't... I can't do this.

636
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,770
Kady, I'm not...
I'm not gonna chase after you.

637
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:18,635
You won't have to.

638
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:21,879
What does that mean?

639
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,147
Look, I'm a liar!

640
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:25,448
Okay?

641
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,780
Okay, I flirted with you
that first day

642
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:28,545
because you looked useful,
and you were.

643
00:39:28,553 --> 00:39:32,022
We stole a lot of shit,
so there it is.

644
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:34,323
I've been using you
this entire time.

645
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:37,461
It's all a lie.

646
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:52,505
Penny.

647
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,610
Five,

648
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:56,512
four,

649
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:58,649
three,

650
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,318
two...

651
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,349
One.

652
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:07,863
I need to sit.

653
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:17,695
I really didn't see this coming.

654
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:21,271
How could you?
You're the best.

655
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:23,972
You know what?

656
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:26,535
I try so hard not to be.

657
00:40:26,544 --> 00:40:28,512
Why?

658
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:31,548
I'm already
pretty damn unpopular.

659
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:33,319
Can you imagine what
they would think

660
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,148
if they knew how good
I really am?

661
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:42,325
"Spinster magician dies alone,
eaten by cats."

662
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:49,700
I always hold back, Quentin.

663
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:51,201
Every single day.
I mean...

664
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:55,906
I have no idea
what I'm even capable of.

665
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:59,576
And I'm just trying so hard
to be anything close to normal.

666
00:40:59,577 --> 00:41:02,877
My friend Julia said that I...

667
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:05,411
I couldn't run away hard enough.

668
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,549
She's right.

669
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:15,926
I run and I...

670
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:19,096
I find secret doors...

671
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:22,227
Whether I'm alone or in a group,
it doesn't matter.

672
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,733
I... Like, I'm here.

673
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,665
I'm in this amazing place.

674
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,039
I have literal magic in my life
and I'm still running.

675
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,080
I'm still this person
that I fucking hate.

676
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,680
Sorry.

677
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:39,622
I think I'm really drunk
right now.

678
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,077
It's okay, Quentin.
I get it.

679
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:46,185
Your ropes are gone.

680
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,759
Yeah, so are yours.

681
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,608
Alice, I...
