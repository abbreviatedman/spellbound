1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,469
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,880
<i>I knew the Beast would come.</i>

3
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,204
Get strong, learn fast,
any means necessary.

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,342
So that's it? That's all
you're gonna say to me?

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,887
I got into the school,
and you didn't.

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,436
I don't know what else to say.

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,105
Marina is a psycho!

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,740
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,252
You don't know "cut off".

10
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,231
I want the spells I'm
missing, so I can keep going.

11
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,484
<i>I want the new ones she stole.</i>

12
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,100
<i>They're locked in
her filing cabinet.</i>

13
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,820
<i>You are a Traveler.</i>

14
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,689
<i>You can move between worlds.</i>

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,957
Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

16
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,056
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,226
<i>Won't make the voices go away,</i>

18
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,100
<i>but it might keep you alive.</i>

19
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,941
All I can say is, it was
some kind of dungeon.

20
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,633
This was on the walls.

21
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,549
Penny, I think
you were in Fillory.

22
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,853
You were in Fillory.
You were in Fillory.

23
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,517
Stop! Okay, Fillory is just a...

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,393
Did you see any animals?
Did they talk to you?

25
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,590
I was at some dungeon,
you Hobbit-loving freak.

26
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,757
What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,266
There are no Hobbits in
Fillory. It doesn't matter.

28
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,978
Ah, the drawing,
the crest, it means

29
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,446
that you were in a
certain Fillorian castle.

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,065
Oh, kill me. It was
built by dwarves.

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,051
Ah, okay, let's not get
caught up in the details.

32
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,239
The point is
that it's full of, uh,

33
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,247
a ton of incredibly
magical shit.

34
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,114
Oh, yeah, the Beast is
really fucking magical.

35
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,695
Let me pop back over there and
see if he does birthday parties.

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,221
Let's go. It's a waste of time.

37
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,688
I think you should
listen to Quentin

38
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,601
because I'm assuming
you didn't travel

39
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,890
to Fillory on some
planned vacation,

40
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,758
so you don't know
how to control it yet.

41
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,630
Then educate yourself.

42
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,531
Nobody knows more
about Fillory than Quentin.

43
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,061
What if you end up
back there again?

44
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,705
She makes a point.

45
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,406
Okay, fanboy.

46
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,290
Tell me what it says
in the books about

47
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,834
not getting my face
eaten by the Beast.

48
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,883
The Beast isn't in the books.

49
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,031
How's that, if I was right
there staring him in the face?

50
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,819
The Chatwins, they
mostly get chased around

51
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,483
by this time witch,
the Watcher Woman.

52
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,523
She plants clocks in trees.

53
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,530
Ah, it's sort of surrealist.

54
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,542
Okay, all right, I take it back.
This is a waste of your time.

55
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,676
The books were written for kids,

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,329
so maybe they skipped the
monster that rips out people's eyes.

57
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,735
I don't know! PENNY: Okay.

58
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,033
We're done here.

59
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,869
You love Fillory so much, I
hope you get to go. I really do.

60
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,014
I guess I've been
trying to convince myself

61
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,218
that Penny's somehow
wrong about Fillory

62
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,352
despite having
actually been there.

63
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,726
That's a pretty
acrobatic form of denial.

64
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,798
I really am sorry.

65
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,107
I'm sure Fillory got you
through a lot as a kid.

66
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,431
Yeah.

67
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,941
As a kid.

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,776
Sorry, the manager
isn't in right now.

69
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,441
Would you like
to place an order?

70
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,045
I know you know who I am.
Look, I'm sorry I insulted you guys.

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,282
But just who talked
to you? Marina? Pete?

72
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,458
I'm going to call the cops.

73
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,188
God, Rick, grow a pair!

74
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,622
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

75
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,895
Please. I don't
know anyone else.

76
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,407
I'm not done with you.

77
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,843
Consider it a warning.

78
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,185
Julia.

79
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,320
Julia, wait. Okay, just wait.

80
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,194
Marina, okay? No
one wants a war.

81
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,025
Here.

82
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,636
It's about an hour by train.
Went there couple of years back.

83
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,799
They're real. They're good.

84
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:06,236
Just give them a try, but please
don't come back here again.

85
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,352
How'd you learn all this anyway?

86
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,955
Me and a friend got deep
into ink spells in high school.

87
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,232
Ah...

88
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,232
It's not the <i>Mona Lisa,</i> but I
do have 20/20 vision in the dark.

89
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,838
And where was all this exactly?

90
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,104
I told you, I'm basically
from the 'burbs.

91
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,377
Actually, you never say a
damn thing about your life.

92
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,615
'Cause it's boring.

93
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,045
What flavor of boring?

94
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,624
My mom died young,

95
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,756
and my dad is kind
of embarrassing.

96
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,864
He wears Birkenstocks
and he sells weed, and...

97
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,168
But he loves me no matter
what kind of trouble I get in.

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,266
That sounds nice. Yeah.

99
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,878
So, this symbol,

100
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,865
will it do anything for
the whole mind-slut shit?

101
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,941
Yeah, you know,
Brakebills is good.

102
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,429
Everyone knows how to pull
their blinds down, you know?

103
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,614
Yeah.

104
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,955
I still hear her, though.
That girl from the dungeon.

105
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,585
Can't shut her out.

106
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,996
I just file that under

107
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,330
"Wish there was jack
shit I could do about it."

108
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,926
Yeah.

109
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,403
Or were you talking
about the Beast?

110
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,201
If I was you, I'd be curious.

111
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,143
He's full-on AWOL, not a peep.

112
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,077
So I get this, and I
don't poke the bear.

113
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,980
Let's just hope the
bear has better shit to do.

114
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,842
Shit, shit, shit.

115
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,666
Hey!

116
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,137
Why are you following me, lady?

117
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,172
Easy. I just want to show you

118
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,209
I'm just like you.

119
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,495
Hello?

120
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,239
Is someone being
creepy on purpose?

121
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,814
Secure the sacrifice!

122
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,414
No! God damn it. No!

123
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,458
O Manon,

124
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,003
we offer up this virgin,

125
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,172
flesh and blood!

126
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,201
Jesus, I'm not a virgin.

127
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,142
Huh.

128
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,906
Life is full of surprises.

129
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,105
What the hell, Margo?

130
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,410
Follow, follow. Hurry, hurry.

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
Ow.

132
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,663
Guys, the pine needles
are hurting my feet.

133
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,687
Shh.

134
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,089
Right there. QUENTIN: Ow, ow.

135
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,309
Hello, first years.

136
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,473
At this appointed hour,
as tradition dictates,

137
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,211
it falls upon the upper class

138
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,345
to administer what
is known simply as

139
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,214
the Trials.

140
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,992
The Trials test your ability

141
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,966
to think and act
like a Magician.

142
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,701
Pass, your journey begins.

143
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,004
Fail, you flunk out.

144
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,708
This is a test engineered
to thin out the herd.

145
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,909
Only those who
should will survive.

146
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,151
Oh, nut up! This isn't Harvard.

147
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,917
It requires actual effort.

148
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,287
And don't bother to go
complaining to the faculty.

149
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,692
They're off on a
luxurious retreat,

150
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,594
observing from a distance.

151
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,431
You are ours, miscreants.

152
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,869
Onward to glory!

153
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,306
Come on! Go! Go!

154
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,284
Name, please?

155
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,251
Alice Quinn.

156
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,827
Hmm. Let me see.

157
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,894
Alice Quinn.

158
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,676
Wow, you're really
enjoying this, aren't you?

159
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,363
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

160
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,235
The Trials themselves
have the power, Alice.

161
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,240
They will pass or fail you
as the Dean created them to.

162
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,012
I merely keep a little eye on
each and every one of you.

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,940
Ah, there you are.

164
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,379
Report to the table
on your placard.

165
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,687
Good luck.

166
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,453
Next!

167
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,862
Say one word about
Fillory, and I'll kill you.

168
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,404
Get me kicked out... Well,
then we'd finally be even.

169
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,802
Now I get it.

170
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,034
Get what?

171
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,640
Why our team name
is Horny Chupacabras.

172
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,210
I'm not a...

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,112
I don't even know
what a chupacabra is.

174
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,275
It's a spine-covered goat-sucking
primate indigenous to Mexico.

175
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,013
I can already see
we are immensely

176
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,384
handicapped by your presence.

177
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,390
In 18th century England,

178
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,523
a secret society known as the
Brethren encrypted hundreds of spells

179
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,726
to hide them from the church.

180
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,963
You may open your blue books.

181
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,132
Each team must decode and
cast their spell by 9:00 a.m.

182
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,473
Screw up, and it's
back to page one.

183
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,917
FYI, this test is pretty
much impossible. Begin.

184
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,523
Back in the day,
we'd travel the world.

185
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,691
We'd pay for spells.
Trade for them.

186
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,670
And they weren't all the most
ambitious Hedges you ever saw,

187
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,434
but we looked out for each
other. It was like family.

188
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,804
First family I really felt
I belonged in, actually.

189
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,176
Okay, so what do
you want exactly?

190
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:35,783
Well, you know, our story
with Marina, it's not rare.

191
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,791
I have seen her chew
people up and spit them out.

192
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,885
Then what? You swoop in, you
buy us a milkshake? Come on.

193
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,362
Not till today.

194
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,667
You are the first I believe
can really do things

195
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,605
if given the
opportunity to learn.

196
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,337
I mean, I can feel
it coming off of you.

197
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,743
You're not an amateur.
You're the real thing.

198
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,311
Yeah, well, some
think so. Some do not.

199
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:13,057
Well, I think we
can help each other.

200
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,686
How?

201
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,760
It's not much, but, you know,
they'll be new to you, I think.

202
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,566
Wait a minute. How did you...

203
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,106
All over. Where did you...

204
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,300
You don't want to know.

205
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,401
But you're welcome to them.

206
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,945
In exchange for what?

207
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,411
Just do some with me.

208
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,182
I miss the feeling, you know?

209
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,130
Welcome, <i>à la</i> Safe House Julia.

210
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,377
Can you make it colder?

211
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,449
Girl, you're strong!

212
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,323
Shit.

213
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,617
Was this the last of them?

214
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,184
Afraid so.

215
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:33,933
Well, hey, we'll hit the
road, right? Find new stuff.

216
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,471
Try, at least.

217
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,240
But you know who has a
ton of new stuff? Marina.

218
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,612
'Cause she got
her memories back.

219
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,447
I helped her do it.

220
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,112
She has...

221
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,712
Brakebills.

222
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,690
So she has everything.

223
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,062
We're screwed. How
much time do we have left?

224
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,467
I don't know. Who knows
how to read an hourglass?

225
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,667
This is impossible. Even
Eliot said it was impossible.

226
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,443
Wait, it's impossible.

227
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,672
Actually, he said, it was
practically impossible,

228
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,407
but maybe some
genius can do this.

229
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,640
So, what, only geniuses
can be Magicians? Really?

230
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,713
We have to cheat.

231
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,820
They want us to. We've
been Kobayashi Maru-ed.

232
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,490
Whatever that means, yes.

233
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,424
No. No way.

234
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,291
You're an idiot. We're cheating.

235
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,855
Why would... Why would
they want us to cheat?

236
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,696
'Cause we're Magicians.

237
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,464
No. No, they just want
to see how far we can get.

238
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,457
There's no such a
thing as half a spell.

239
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,040
You guys are insane.

240
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,006
Supply closet. Five
minutes. I've got a plan.

241
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,855
Oh, man! They really upped
the security since my day.

242
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,087
How much do you
know about those wards?

243
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,593
Enough to know they're strong,

244
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,823
but not enough to
break them, so...

245
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,073
What do you think
would happen if we just

246
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,742
ran in there and
grabbed the filing cabinet?

247
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,826
Oh, yeah, sure.

248
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,233
You ever see the movie <i>Scanners?</i>

249
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,536
Oh.

250
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,498
There's a way.
There's always a way.

251
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,676
You have a pen?

252
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,210
Here.

253
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,915
What we need...

254
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,125
Think of it like a fishhook.

255
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,025
We grab the cabinets from
the room without tripping wards.

256
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,391
There's wards all over the room.

257
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,557
Yeah, in this dimension, sure.

258
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,833
The one thing I can't figure
out is how to get the hook in.

259
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,865
You know, we need
someone inside for that.

260
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,866
And I sort of burned
all my bridges with that.

261
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,335
You think we can
pay someone off?

262
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,603
No.

263
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,507
I know someone.

264
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,553
Took you long enough.
Okay, here's the question.

265
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,070
Do you believe
what you said earlier,

266
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,571
that a genius could
solve this by dawn?

267
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,706
Well, yeah, I
mean, if they were...

268
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,730
Alice Quinn?

269
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,466
If anyone, she could.

270
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,797
Can you read her mind?

271
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,169
No. Unlike you, she's airtight.

272
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,370
But I can do one better.

273
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,685
Just light the fucking thing.

274
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,033
Nicely done.

275
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,241
Perfect execution.

276
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,869
Too bad I know you cheated.

277
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,385
Congratulations, you two,
and on to the second Trial.

278
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,481
Well, what about...

279
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,822
Thinning the herd.

280
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,237
So are you gonna tell
me who we're meeting?

281
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,101
Yeah, she's not a
hedge witch exactly,

282
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,802
but, well, her and I
have some history.

283
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,921
So I think it's best... What
do you mean by "history"?

284
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,675
Hey, chickadee!

285
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,272
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

286
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,817
This is your daughter.

287
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,481
What's she doing here?

288
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,713
She's a friend.

289
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,516
Okay, come on,
babe. Please, sit.

290
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,819
How are you? How have you been?

291
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,955
Just tell me what you want, Mom.

292
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,493
I want to give you something.

293
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,761
Oh, that's so sweet!

294
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,099
Yeah, my birthday
was seven months ago.

295
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,435
Kady, look, I was
not in a good place

296
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,168
the last time you saw me,

297
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,800
but my shit's together now.

298
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,141
Oh, is it? Is that why
you're hanging out

299
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,931
with the angriest bitch
from the safe house?

300
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,711
Oh, if you want to insult
me, you should try again.

301
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,012
Just...

302
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,613
Listen.

303
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,184
I called because Julia and
I have a line on something.

304
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,286
Oh, my God, here we go again.

305
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,026
We're gonna start our own house.

306
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,964
Nothing crazy, but it'll
be safe from Marina,

307
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,994
so come with us.

308
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,131
My God, you're insane.

309
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,332
You actually think
that you can beat her.

310
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,274
Hey, Marina's
strong, but so are we.

311
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,181
Nothing like that
at school, huh?

312
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,483
Protection charm.

313
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,426
It'll render our house
literally invisible.

314
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,490
You know, the amazing thing is

315
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,895
you actually believe
that this plan could work.

316
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,265
Marina will never let me go.

317
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,196
Ever.

318
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,208
Oh, did Hannah give
you the whole sob story?

319
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,001
Kady... No, no.

320
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,476
Marina didn't betray my mom.

321
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,671
She cleaned up her mess.

322
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,257
Yeah, Hannah, well, she wanted
to steal something. Big heist, right?

323
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,113
Except she can't handle her shit

324
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,947
under pressure,
and two people died.

325
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,647
Cut to now, Marina
gets to demand

326
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,314
that I steal shit
10 times a week.

327
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,858
Yeah, no big.

328
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,559
Don't call me again.

329
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,299
You can't take
that! Let her have it.

330
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,301
No, we need it. So does she.

331
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,237
If I had more,
I'd give you more.

332
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,969
Yeah.

333
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,338
But you don't.

334
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,142
You sold your
daughter to Marina?

335
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,014
No, Marina stole her.

336
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,747
Yeah, because of a really bad
judgment call that you made.

337
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,619
She said she had my back.
This is not black and white.

338
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,852
Yeah, well, Kady sure
seems to think that it is.

339
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,395
If this goes how we
want, I can fix that, too.

340
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,815
"If this..." Do you
hear yourself?

341
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,007
"If this works out"? I'm out.

342
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,523
Oh, no, you don't.
You do not cut me off.

343
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,536
My daughter just
got brought into this.

344
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,773
And I will share with
you everything I can,

345
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,134
but it is better that I
see this through alone.

346
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:07,059
This looks like a home
brew. Where did you get it?

347
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,358
Found it inside an old textbook.

348
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,823
It looks underwhelming.

349
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,834
So how's Professor
March's research going?

350
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,303
Look, I tried, but he won't
take on first year assistants.

351
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,035
Well, you're just his type,
so I'm sure you'll figure it out.

352
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,519
"But where's the door, Martin?

353
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,757
"There's always a door to
Fillory when we really need it.

354
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,824
"In the clock, or the
closet, or my panties?"

355
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,428
Come on, celebrate! You
passed, you dirty cheater.

356
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,102
What's the problem? Speak.

357
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,176
No offense, you're
just not exactly...

358
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,238
Warm and cuddly? I know.

359
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,409
You ever want something so badly

360
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,817
and then realize that it's
nothing like what you thought,

361
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,152
and maybe that you are stupid

362
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,542
for ever actually
even wanting it?

363
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,386
Every guy I've ever slept with.

364
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,319
Fillory is real.

365
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,363
Oh, come the fuck on. It is.

366
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,957
Penny is a Traveler,

367
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,662
and he went
there, and it's real.

368
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,106
Look like your head's
about to pop off.

369
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,403
I loved those books.

370
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,935
You did?

371
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,137
Why so surprised?

372
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,215
I'd pretend I was ambassador
to the Fillorian Outer Islands.

373
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,608
But the real thing,
it's not like the story.

374
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,086
So, what, it's actually
totally shitty over there?

375
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,815
I don't know. Maybe. Yes.

376
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,695
At least a little.

377
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,789
The thing that attacked us,
that ripped the Dean's eyes out,

378
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,268
seems like it might
be from Fillory.

379
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,729
Jesus.

380
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,034
That is not tonally
consistent with the books.

381
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,441
No, it's not. And
that... I just...

382
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,278
I find that devastating.

383
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,909
Were you planning a trip there?

384
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,180
No, really.

385
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,684
Because, otherwise,
you're literally

386
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,122
torturing yourself
over a fairy tale.

387
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,925
Quentin, you
passed the first Trial.

388
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,793
You live to fight another day.

389
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,992
Drink up. Go to the party.
Find someone to bang.

390
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,267
Celebrate the world
you're in, dummy.

391
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,666
Come on!

392
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,636
Okay.

393
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,541
Well, I'm a little...

394
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,746
I am very...

395
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,808
Wow, I'm really, uh...

396
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,981
Margo, did you roofie me?

397
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:21,043
Can we skip down to where you
realize you no makey magic here?

398
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,449
Oh. Cucumber. Daddy's favorite.

399
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,661
And too much dill.

400
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,330
There they all are, all
those little fishies, just like us,

401
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,968
eating, shitting, breeding.

402
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,567
I require one.

403
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,769
- It's over there.
- Chop chop.

404
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,609
I am literally losing
the will to live.

405
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,443
So this is my next test?

406
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,510
I'm supposed to spear a fish?

407
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,218
Do your lips move when you read?

408
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,523
Seriously? One arrow?

409
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,035
Eliot!

410
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,694
Bring him to me.

411
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,299
Why?

412
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,667
I want to get my
Catherine the Great on.

413
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,140
Google it. Totally hilarious.

414
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,035
Oh, and to help you out.

415
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,649
No. Just no, okay?

416
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,510
Okay.

417
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,777
Wait.

418
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,825
I'm seeing your future now.

419
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,754
Gay porn?

420
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,693
<i>Mi favorito.</i>

421
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,964
Liver.

422
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,592
Julia, stop!

423
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,309
You're gonna blow
yourself up! I was getting it.

424
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,802
You really weren't, hon.

425
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,337
How did you get in?

426
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,339
I unpicked your ward.

427
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,800
I would go with
Koyosegi next time.

428
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,654
Thank you for the advice.
Now, can you please leave?

429
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,772
We already agreed that
we're not partners, okay?

430
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:06,046
Well, it didn't work because
you need 10 extra digits.

431
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,484
Actually, I don't.

432
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,414
It's interesting how
you can't look at me.

433
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,087
Know why?

434
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,094
'Cause I'm too familiar.

435
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,864
I mean, we both made mistakes.

436
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,926
We live with them. We go on.

437
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,332
Alone, if we have to.

438
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,340
But you do this alone,

439
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,974
and you will get hurt.

440
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,476
Come on. We can
help each other out.

441
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,479
Please.

442
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,681
I want my daughter back.

443
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,527
Kady?

444
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,363
Kady. Hey, Kady!

445
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,238
Kady. Kady! Stop
it! Stop it! Stop it!

446
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,503
Let go! Let go! No.

447
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,442
I have to catch
the bird. No! Hey!

448
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,878
This shit is dumb. The
school is not worth it.

449
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,917
No, I can't! You don't get
it. I can't get kicked out!

450
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,349
Ow! Fuck! Oh, my God.

451
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,978
Jesus. Oh, my God. Is it broken?

452
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,784
I don't know. Ah.

453
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,655
Let me see. Let me
see. Let me look at it.

454
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,821
It's not broken. Look, talk
to me. What's going on?

455
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,866
Look, it's just...
This is all I have.

456
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,995
Me, too.

457
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,038
No, it's different.

458
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:39,241
I'm different. I
need Brakebills.

459
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,807
It's life or death.
I have to be here.

460
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:47,752
Hey.

461
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,258
What are you supposed
to get with that?

462
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,537
A fucking pheasant.

463
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,072
You? A horse.

464
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,569
These people are crazy.

465
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,210
Let's go find the others.

466
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,144
Come on.

467
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,390
Yo!

468
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,360
Seriously, dude,
I almost had him.

469
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,922
We'll get him, son.

470
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,535
It's not about magic 'cause
it's about talking to each other.

471
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,871
All right, you got that.

472
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,308
But I grew up in Florida,

473
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,710
so I actually know how
to use it to get your fish.

474
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,849
But I'm after a horse.

475
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,713
Seriously? What?

476
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,416
Junior Cowboy Camp.

477
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,686
Pheasant.

478
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,388
Tree.

479
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,686
You're bleeding.

480
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,452
I hated Junior Cowboy Camp.

481
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,459
Timber!

482
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,123
Bravo!

483
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,058
Brava. Brava.

484
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,801
That's it? We passed?

485
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,500
After you chop the
tree into firewood,

486
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,303
whip us up a little
grilled salmon.

487
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,405
Some honeyed pheasant.

488
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,379
And take turns
blowing the horse.

489
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,706
Did you see the look
on Quentin's face? Yes.

490
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,833
Like, "Fine, but I
am not going first."

491
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,678
I'm sure by now, you've realized

492
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:33,344
Brakebills teaches us to be
arch and ironic about magic.

493
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,077
But this one plays it serious.

494
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,118
You must bare yourself

495
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:41,125
in the presence of
another magical adept

496
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,094
and expose your highest

497
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,290
governing internal circumstance,

498
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:51,762
which is to say
your utmost truth.

499
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,668
You have till midnight.

500
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,839
Ready?

501
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,908
Oh, shit!

502
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,658
Shit!

503
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:52,921
No!

504
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,383
Okay, it's a two-person spell.

505
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,288
Both must succeed to unlock it.

506
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,824
You bind your
hands with this rope.

507
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,692
How am I gonna survive?

508
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,298
It'll fall off once you've
reached transcendence.

509
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,177
Okay, it's got to be some
kind of scheme, right?

510
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,568
To record us playing
naked truth-or-dare,

511
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,915
so they can blackmail
us or something.

512
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,135
Unfortunately,
Margo wasn't lying.

513
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,905
It's arcane and
a bit unorthodox,

514
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,538
but Secrets Magic
is a real thing.

515
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,145
Basically, there's no
trick or cheat to this.

516
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,151
It's kind of the exact opposite.

517
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,110
Focus. I'm trying.

518
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,450
All clear. Good to go.

519
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,397
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no.

520
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,269
Run.

521
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,877
Hannah! Hannah!

522
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,820
You said it was all clear.
You said it was gonna be okay.

523
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,255
Go! Run! Marina is coming.

524
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,453
We need to get you help.

525
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,318
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

526
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,622
You know, it's not
part of the spell,

527
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,376
but I think it could
make things easier.

528
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,319
You know, I always thought

529
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,914
when I partook in
a nude magic ritual

530
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,522
that I'd be sort of
in a mystical trance.

531
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,594
Tell that to the girl who lost her
virginity with all her clothes on.

532
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:16,028
<i>Hide the sun</i>

533
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:22,667
<i>I will leave your
face out of my mind</i>

534
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,806
<i>You should save your eyes</i>

535
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:38,512
<i>A thousand voices
howling in my head</i>

536
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,104
Okay. Okay.

537
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,942
Uh...

538
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,271
I've been institutionalized
more than once.

539
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,080
Maybe we shouldn't drink.

540
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,092
Or we should drink more.

541
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,057
Yeah.

542
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,130
William. Really?

543
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,099
Ask me something harder if
you want us to get somewhere.

544
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,368
<i>Away, away</i>

545
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,241
Ask me why I'm nice to you.

546
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,451
I had noticed you're a tad
brusque with everyone else.

547
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,420
And why is that?

548
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,690
Penny, you don't have to.

549
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,694
Look, I'm not scared to tell
you this because it's true.

550
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,456
Shit.

551
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,193
Okay.

552
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,963
Truth.

553
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,202
I am scared to tell you
this because it's true.

554
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,743
I'm falling in love with you.

555
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,313
<i>All the stars are
shining bloody red</i>

556
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,519
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

557
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,482
Kady, I'm not
gonna chase after...

558
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,853
You won't have to.

559
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,791
What does that mean?

560
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,053
Look, I'm a liar, okay?

561
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,174
I flirted with
you that first day

562
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,860
because you looked
useful, and you were.

563
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,492
Look, we stole a lot
of shit, so there it is.

564
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,338
I've been using
you this entire time.

565
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,602
It's all a lie.

566
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,907
<i>Black out days</i>

567
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:49,253
<i>I don't recognize you anymore</i>

568
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,551
Penny.

569
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,217
Five.

570
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,453
Four.

571
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,723
Three.

572
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,858
Two.

573
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,164
One.

574
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,737
I need to sit.

575
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,212
I really didn't see this coming.

576
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,648
How could you? You're the best.

577
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,686
You know what?

578
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,358
I try so hard not to be.

579
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,884
Why?

580
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,690
I'm already pretty
damn unpopular.

581
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,889
Can you imagine
what they would think

582
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,400
if they knew how
good I really am?

583
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,334
"Spinster Magician
dies alone eaten by cats."

584
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,772
I always hold back, Quentin.

585
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,012
Every single day. I mean,

586
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,917
I have no idea what
I'm even capable of,

587
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,980
and I'm just trying so hard

588
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,854
to be anything close to normal.

589
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:05,263
My friend Julia said that I
couldn't run away hard enough.

590
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,499
She's right.

591
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,872
I run, and I...

592
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,506
I find secret doors.

593
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,704
Whether I'm alone or in
a group doesn't matter.

594
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,944
Like, I'm here. I'm
in this amazing place.

595
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,647
I have literal magic in my
life, and I'm still running.

596
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,247
I'm still this person
that I fucking hate.

597
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,997
Sorry. I'm really
drunk right now.

598
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,726
It's okay, Quentin. I get it.

599
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,567
Your ropes are gone.

600
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,733
Yeah, so are yours.

601
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,587
Alice, I...
