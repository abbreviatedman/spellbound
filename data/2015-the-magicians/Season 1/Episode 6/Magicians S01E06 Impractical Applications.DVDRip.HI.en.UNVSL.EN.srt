So that's it? That's all
you're gonna say to me?

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,887
I got into the school,
and you didn't.

I don't know what else to say.

00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,105
Marina is a psycho!

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,740
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,252
You don't know "cut
off". (SCREAMS)

10
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,231
I want the spells I'm
missing, so I can keep going.

Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

16
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,056
It works by binding

20
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,941
All I can say is, it was
some kind of dungeon.

00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,633
KADY: This was on the walls.

22
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,549
QUENTIN: Penny, I
think you were in Fillory.

23
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,853
You were in Fillory.
You were in Fillory.

24
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,517
Stop! Okay, Fillory is just a...

25
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,393
Did you see any animals?
Did they talk to you?

26
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,590
I was at some dungeon,
you Hobbit-loving freak.

27
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,757
What's wrong with you?

28
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,266
There are no Hobbits in
Fillory. It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,978
Ah, the drawing,
the crest, it means

30
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,446
that you were in a
certain Fillorian castle.

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,065
Oh, kill me. It was
built by dwarves.

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,051
Ah, okay, let's not get
caught up in the details.

33
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,239
The point is
that it's full of, uh,

34
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,247
a ton of incredibly
magical shit.

35
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,114
Oh, yeah, the Beast is
really fucking magical.

36
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,695
Let me pop back over there and
see if he does birthday parties.

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,221
Let's go. It's a waste of time.

38
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,688
I think you should
listen to Quentin

39
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,601
because I'm assuming
you didn't travel

40
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,890
to Fillory on some
planned vacation,

41
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,758
so you don't know
how to control it yet.

42
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,630
Then educate yourself.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,531
Nobody knows more
about Fillory than Quentin.

44
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,061
What if you end up
back there again?

45
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,705
She makes a point.

46
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,406
Okay, fanboy.

47
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,290
Tell me what it says
in the books about

48
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,834
not getting my face
eaten by the Beast.

50
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,883
The Beast isn't in the books.

51
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,031
How's that, if I was right
there staring him in the face?

52
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,819
The Chatwins, they
mostly get chased around

53
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,483

the Watcher Woman.

54
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,523
She plants clocks in trees.

55
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,530
Ah, it's sort of surrealist.

56
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,542
Okay, all right, I take it back.
This is a waste of your time.

57
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,676
The books were written for kids,

58
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,329
so maybe they skipped the
monster that rips out people's eyes.

59
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,735
I don't know! PENNY: Okay.

60

You love Fillory so much, I
hope you get to go. I really do.

62
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,014
I guess I've been
trying to convince myself

63
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,218
that Penny's somehow
wrong about Fillory

64
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,352
despite having
actually been there.

65
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,726
That's a pretty
acrobatic form of denial.

66
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,798
I really am sorry.

67
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,107
I'm sure Fillory got you
through a lot as a kid.

68
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,431
Yeah.

Look, I'm sorry I insulted you guys.

to you? Marina? Pete?

on your placard.

178
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,687
Good luck.

179
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,453
Next!

180
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,862
Say one word about
Fillory, and I'll kill you.

181
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,404
Get me kicked out... Well,
then we'd finally be even.

182
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,802
Now I get it.

183
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,034
Get what?

184
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,640
Why our team name
is Horny Chupacabras.

185
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,210
I'm not a... (STUTTERING)

186
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,112
I don't even know
what a chupacabra is.

187
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,275
It's a spine-covered goat-sucking
primate indigenous to Mexico.

188
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,013
I can already see
we are immensely

189
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,384
handicapped by your presence.

190
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,454
(LAUGHS)

191
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,390
In 18th century England,

192
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,523
a secret society known as the
Brethren encrypted hundreds of spells

193
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,726
to hide them from the church.

194
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,963
You may open your blue books.

195
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,132
Each team must decode and
cast their spell by 9:00 a.m.

196
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,473
Screw up, and it's
back to page one.

197
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,917
FYI, this test is pretty
much impossible. Begin.

198
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,523
HANNAH: Back in the
day, we'd travel the world.

199
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,691
We'd pay for spells.
Trade for them.

200
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,670
And they weren't all the most
ambitious Hedges you ever saw,

201
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,434
but we looked out for each
other. It was like family.

202
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,804
First family I really felt
I belonged in, actually.

203
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,176
Okay, so what do
you want exactly?

204
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:35,783
Well, you know, our story
with Marina, it's not rare.

205
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,791
I have seen her chew
people up and spit them out.

206
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,885
Then what? You swoop in, you
buy us a milkshake? Come on.

207
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,362
(SCOFFS) Not till today.

208
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,667
You are the first I believe
can really do things

209
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,605
if given the
opportunity to learn.

210
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,337
I mean, I can feel
it coming off of you.

211
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,743
You're not an amateur.
You're the real thing.

212
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,311
Yeah, well, some
think so. Some do not.

213
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:13,057
Well, I think we
can help each other.

214
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,686
How?

215
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,458
(SNIFFS, CLEARS THROAT)

216
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,760
It's not much, but, you know,
they'll be new to you, I think.

217
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,566
Wait a minute. How did you...

218
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,106
All over. Where did you...

219
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,300
You don't want to know.

220
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,401
But you're welcome to them.

221
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,945
In exchange for what?

222
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,411
Just do some with me.

223
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,182
I miss the feeling, you know?

224
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,886
(FINGERS SNAPPING)

225
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,130
Welcome, <i>à la</i> Safe House Julia.

226
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,377
Can you make it colder?

227
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,449
Girl, you're strong!

228
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,323
Shit.

229
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,617
Was this the last of them?

230
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,184
Afraid so.

231
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,596
(EXHALES)

232
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:33,933
Well, hey, we'll hit the
road, right? Find new stuff.

233
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,471
Try, at least.

234
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,240
But you know who has a
ton of new stuff? Marina.

235
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,612
'Cause she got
her memories back.

236
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,447
I helped her do it.

237
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,112
She has...

238
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,712
Brakebills.

239
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,690
So she has everything.

240
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,062
We're screwed. How
much time do we have left?

241
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,467
I don't know. Who knows
how to read an hourglass?

242
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,667
This is impossible. Even
Eliot said it was impossible.

243
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,443
Wait, it's impossible.

244
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,672
Actually, he said, it was
practically impossible,

245
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,407
but maybe some
genius can do this.

246
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,640
So, what, only geniuses
can be Magicians? Really?

247
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,713
We have to cheat.

248
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,820
They want us to. We've
been Kobayashi Maru-ed.

249
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,490
Whatever that means, yes.

250
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,424
No. No way.

251
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,291
You're an idiot. We're cheating.

252
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,855
Why would... Why would
they want us to cheat?

253
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,696
'Cause we're Magicians.

254
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,464
No. No, they just want
to see how far we can get.

QUENTIN: There's no
such a thing as half a spell.

You guys are insane.

minutes. I've got a plan.

HANNAH: Oh, man! They really
upped the security since my day.

259
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,087
How much do you
know about those wards?

260
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,593
Enough to know they're strong,

261
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,823
but not enough to
break them, so...

262
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,073
What do you think
would happen if we just

263
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,742
ran in there and
grabbed the filing cabinet?

264
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,826
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah, sure.

265
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,233

Oh.

There's a way.
There's always a way.

You have a pen?

269
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,210
Here.

270
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,915
What we need...

271
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,125
Think of it like a fishhook.

272
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,025
We grab the cabinets from
the room without tripping wards.

273
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,391
There's wards all over the room.

274
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,557
Yeah, in this dimension, sure.

275
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,833
The one thing I can't figure
out is how to get the hook in.

276
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,865
You know, we need
someone inside for that.

277
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,866
And I sort of burned
all my bridges with that.

278
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,335
You think we can
pay someone off?

279
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,603
No.

280
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,507
I know someone.

(ENGINE STARTING)

282
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,553
Took you long enough.
Okay, here's the question.

283
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,070
Do you believe
what you said earlier,

284
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,571
that a genius could
solve this by dawn?

285
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,706
Well, yeah, I
mean, if they were...

286
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,730
Alice Quinn?

287
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,466
If anyone, she could.

288
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,797
Can you read her mind?

289
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,169
No. Unlike you, she's airtight.

290
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,370
But I can do one better.

291
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,685
Just light the fucking thing.

292
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,033
Nicely done.

293
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,241
Perfect execution.

294
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,869
Too bad I know you cheated.

295
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,385
Congratulations, you two,
and on to the second Trial.

296
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,481
Well, what about...

Thinning the herd.

298
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,237
So are you gonna tell
me who we're meeting?

299
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,101
Yeah, she's not a
hedge witch exactly,

300
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,802
but, well, her and I
have some history.

301
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,921
So I think it's best... What
do you mean by "history"?

302
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,675
Hey, chickadee!

303
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,272
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

is your daughter.

00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,481
What's she doing here?

306
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,713
She's a friend.

307
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,516
Okay, come on,
babe. Please, sit.

308
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,819
How are you? How have you been?

309
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,955
(SCOFFS) Just tell me
what you want, Mom.

310
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,493
I want to give you something.

311
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,761
Oh, that's so sweet!

312
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,099
Yeah, my birthday
was seven months ago.

313
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,435
Kady, look, I was
not in a good place

314
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,168
the last time you saw me,

315
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,800
but my shit's together now.

316
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,141
Oh, is it? Is that why
you're hanging out

317
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,931
with the angriest bitch
from the safe house?

318
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,711
Oh, if you want to insult
me, you should try again.

319
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,012
Just...

320
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,613
Listen.

321
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,184
I called because Julia and
I have a line on something.

322
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,286
Oh, my God, here we go again.

323
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,026
We're gonna start our own house.

324
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,964
Nothing crazy, but it'll
be safe from Marina,

325
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,994
so come with us.

326
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,131
My God, you're insane.

327
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,332
You actually think
that you can beat her.

328
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,274
Hey, Marina's
strong, but so are we.

329
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,181
Nothing like that
at school, huh?

330
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,483
Protection charm.

331
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,426
It'll render our house
literally invisible.

332
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,490
You know, the amazing thing is

333
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,895
you actually believe
that this plan could work.

334
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,265
Marina will never let me go.

335
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,196
Ever.

336
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,208
Oh, did Hannah give
you the whole sob story?

337
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,001
HANNAH: Kady... No, no.

338
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,476
Marina didn't betray my mom.

339
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,671
She cleaned up her mess.

340
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,257
Yeah, Hannah, well, she wanted
to steal something. Big heist, right?

341
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,113
Except she can't handle her shit

342
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,947
under pressure,
and two people died.

343
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,647
Cut to now, Marina
gets to demand

344
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,314
that I steal shit
10 times a week.

345
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,858
Yeah, no big.

346
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,559
Don't call me again.

347
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,299
You can't take
that! Let her have it.

348
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,301
No, we need it. So does she.

349
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,237
If I had more,
I'd give you more.

350
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,969
Yeah.

351
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,338
But you don't.

352
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,142
You sold your
daughter to Marina?

353
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,014
No, Marina stole her.

354
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,747
Yeah, because of a really bad
judgment call that you made.

355
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,619
She said she had my back.
This is not black and white.

356
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,852
Yeah, well, Kady sure
seems to think that it is.

357
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,395
If this goes how we
want, I can fix that, too.

358
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,815
"If this..." Do you
hear yourself?

359
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,007
"If this works out"? I'm out.

360
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,523
Oh, no, you don't.
You do not cut me off.

361
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,536
My daughter just
got brought into this.

362
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,773
And I will share with
you everything I can,

363
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,134
but it is better that I
see this through alone.

364
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:07,059
This looks like a home
brew. Where did you get it?

365
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,358
Found it inside an old textbook.

366
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,922
(INHALES)

367
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,823
It looks underwhelming.

368
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,834
So how's Professor
March's research going?

369
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,303
Look, I tried, but he won't
take on first year assistants.

370
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,035
Well, you're just his type,
so I'm sure you'll figure it out.

371
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,519
"But where's the door, Martin?

372
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,757
"There's always a door to
Fillory when we really need it.

373
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,824
"In the clock, or the
closet, or my panties?"

374
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,428
Come on, celebrate! You
passed, you dirty cheater.

375
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,102
What's the problem? Speak.

376
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,176
No offense, you're
just not exactly...

377
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,238
Warm and cuddly? I know.

378
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,409
You ever want something so badly

379
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,817
and then realize that it's
nothing like what you thought,

380
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,152
and maybe that you are stupid

381
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,542
for ever actually
even wanting it?

382
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,386
Every guy I've ever slept with.

383
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,319
Fillory is real.

384
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,363
Oh, come the fuck on. It is.

385
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,957
Penny is a Traveler,

386
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,662
and he went
there, and it's real.

387
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,106
Look like your head's
about to pop off.

388
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,403
I loved those books.

389
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,935
You did?

390
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,137
Why so surprised?

391
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,215
I'd pretend I was ambassador
to the Fillorian Outer Islands.

392
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,608
But the real thing,
it's not like the story.

393
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,086
So, what, it's actually
totally shitty over there?

394
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,815
I don't know. Maybe. Yes.

395
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,695
At least a little.

396
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,789
The thing that attacked us,
that ripped the Dean's eyes out,

397
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,268
seems like it might
be from Fillory.

398
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,729
Jesus.

399
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,034
That is not tonally
consistent with the books.

400
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,441
No, it's not. And
that... I just...

401
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,278
I find that devastating.

402
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,909
Were you planning a trip there?

403
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,180
No, really.

404
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,684
Because, otherwise,
you're literally

405
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,122
torturing yourself
over a fairy tale.

406
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,925
Quentin, you
passed the first Trial.

407
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,793
You live to fight another day.

408
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,992
Drink up. Go to the party.
Find someone to bang.

409
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,267
Celebrate the world
you're in, dummy.

00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,666

realize you no makey magic here?

00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,449
Oh. Cucumber. Daddy's favorite.

421
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,661
And too much dill. (SPITS)

those little fishies, just like us,

424
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,567
I require one.

425
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,769
It's over there.
(CLAPS) Chop chop.

426
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,609
I am literally losing
the will to live.

427
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,443
So this is my next test?

428
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,510
I'm supposed to spear a fish?

429
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,218
Do your lips move when you read?

430
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,523

Bring him to me.

434
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,299
Why?

435
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,667
I want to get my
Catherine the Great on.

436
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,140

437
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,035
Oh, and to help you out.

438
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,649
No. Just no, okay?

439
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,510
Okay.

440
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,777
Wait.

441
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,825

yourself up! I was getting it.

we're not partners, okay?

you can't look at me.
