and you didn't.

else to say.

You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

You don't know "cut off".

16
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,231
It works by binding

All I can say is,
it was some kind
of dungeon.

you were in Fillory.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,999
You were in Fillory.
You were in Fillory.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,673
Stop!
Okay, Fillory is just a...

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,512
Did you see any animals?
Did they talk to you?

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,716
I was at some dungeon,
you Hobbit-loving freak.

27

What's wrong with you?

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,435
There are no
Hobbits in Fillory.
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,080
Ah, the drawing,
the crest, it means

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,559
that you were in a certain
Fillorian castle.

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,234
Ch, kill me.
It was built by dwarves.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,152
Ah, okay, let's not get
caught up in the details.

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,392
The point is that
it's full of, uh,

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,391
a ton of incredibly
magical shit.

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,232
Oh, yeah, the Beast is
really fucking magical.

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,795
Let me pop back over
there and see if he
does birthday parties.

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,397
Let's go.
It's a waste of time.

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,834
I think you should
listen to Quentin

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,714
because I'm assuming
you didn't travel

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,030
to Fillory on some
planned vacation,

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,913
so you don't know
how to control it yet.

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,794
Then educate yourself.

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,670
Nobody knows
more about Fillory
than Quentin.

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,239
What if you end up
back there again?

45
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,839
She makes a point.

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,555
Okay, fanboy.

47

in the books about

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,914

eaten by the Beast.

The Beast isn't
in the books.

51

How's that, if I was
right there staring
him in the face?

52

chased around

in trees.

Ah, it's sort of
surrealist.

56
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,637
Okay, all right,
I take it back. This
is a waste of your time.

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,790
The books were
written for kids,

58
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,474
so maybe they skipped
the monster that rips
out people's eyes.

59

I hope you get to go.

trying to convince myself

that Penny's somehow
wrong about Fillory

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,511

actually been there.

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,920
That's a pretty acrobatic
form of denial.

I really am sorry.

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,238

through a lot as a kid.

176
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,080
Ah, there you are.

177
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,510
Report to the table
on your placard.

178
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,834
Good luck.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,549
Next!

180
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,996
Say one word
about Fillory,
and I'll kill you.

181
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,555
Get me kicked out...
Well, then we'd
finally be even.

182
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,909
Now I get it.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,149
Get what?

184
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,750
Why our team name
is Horny Chupacabras.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,357
I'm not a... (STUTTERING)

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,272
I don't even know
what a chupacabra is.

187
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,392
It's a spine-covered
goat-sucking primate
indigenous to Mexico.

188
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,153
I can already see
we are immensely

189
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,514
handicapped by
your presence.

190
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,590
(LAUGHS)

191
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,510
In 18th century England,

192
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,629
a secret society
known as the Brethren
encrypted hundreds of spells

193
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,876
to hide them from the church.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,110
You may open your blue books.

195
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,274
Each team must decode
and cast their spell
by 9:00 a.m.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,634
Screw up, and it's
back to page one.

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,038
FYI, this test is pretty
much impossible. Begin.

198
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,632
HANNAH: Back in the day,
we'd travel the world.

199
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,792
We'd pay for spells.
Trade for them.

200
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,751
And they weren't
all the most ambitious
Hedges you ever saw,

201
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,555
but we looked
out for each other.
It was like family.

202
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,955
First family I really
felt I belonged in,
actually.

203
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,318
Okay, so what do
you want exactly?

204
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,914
Well, you know,
our story with Marina,
it's not rare.

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,913
I have seen her
chew people up
and spit them out.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,992
Then what? You swoop in,
you buy us a milkshake?
Come on.

207
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,515
(SCOFFS)
Not till today.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,789
You are the first
I believe can
really do things

209
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,718
if given the opportunity
to learn.

210
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,476
I mean, I can feel
it coming off of you.

211
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,877
You're not an amateur.
You're the real thing.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,436
Yeah, well, some think so.
Some do not.

213
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,196
Well, I think we can
help each other.

214
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,835
H ow?

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,878
It's not much, but,
you know, they'll
be new to you, I think.

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,674
Waita minute.
How did you...

218
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,239
All over.
Where did you...

219
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,435
You don't want to know.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,513
But you're
welcome to them.

221
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,079
In exchange for what?

222
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,556
Just do some with me.

223
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,312
I miss the feeling,
you know?

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,029
(FINGERS SNAPPING)

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,231
Welcome, <i>é</i> Ia
Safe House Julia.

226
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,514
Can you make it colder?

227
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,597
Girl, you're strong!

228
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,430
Shit.

229
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,713
Was this the last of them?

230
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,313
Afraid so.

231
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,710
(EXHALES)

232
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Well, hey, we'll
hit the road, right?
Find new stuff.

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,632
Try, at least.

234
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,395
But you know who has
a ton of new stuff?
Marina.

235
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,758
'Cause she got
her memories back.

236
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,549
I helped her do it.

237
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,233
She has...

238
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,833
Brakebills.

239
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,792
So she has everything.

240
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,199
We're screwed.
How much time
do we have left?

241
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,590
I don't know.
Who knows how to
read an hourglass?

242
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,839
This is impossible.
Even Eliot said
it was impossible.

243
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,554
Wait, it's impossible.

244
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,796
Actually, he said,
it was practically
impossible,

245
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,518
but maybe some
genius can do this.

246
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,792
So, what, only
geniuses can be
Magicians? Really?

247
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,829
We have to cheat.

248
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,956
They want us to. We've
been Kobayashi Maru-ed.

249
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,594
Whatever that means, yes.

250
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,557
No. No way.

251
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,438
You're an idiot.
We're cheating.

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,956
Why would...
Why would they
want us to cheat?

253
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,792
'Cause we're Magicians.

254
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,599
No. No, they just
want to see how
far we can get.

255
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,193

a thing as half a spell.

Five minutes.
I've got a plan.

258
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,994
HANNAH: Oh, man!
They really upped
the security since my day.

259
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,198
How much do you
know about those wards?

260
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,714
Enough to know
they're strong,

261
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,950
but not enough to
break them, so...

262
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,110
What do you think
would happen if we just

263
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,793
ran in there and grabbed
the filing cabinet?

264
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,951
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah, sure.

265
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,394

Oh.

267

There's a way.
There's always a way.

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,789
You have a pen?

269
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,355
Here.

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,073
What we need...

271
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,237
Think of it like
a fishhook.

272
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,153
We grab the cabinets
from the room without
tripping wards.

273
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,473
There's wards
all over the room.

274
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,716
Yeah, in this
dimension, sure.

275
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,953
The one thing I can't
figure out is how
to get the hook in.

276
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,996
You know, we need
someone inside for that.

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,992
And I sort of burned
all my bridges with that.

278
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,479
You think we can
pay someone off?

279
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,755
No.

280
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,639
I know someone.

281
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,199
(ENGINE STARTING)

282
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,675
Took you long enough.
Okay, here's the question.

283
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,155
Do you believe
what you said earlier,

284
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,639
that a genius could
solve this by dawn?

285
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,790
Well, yeah, I mean,
if they were...

286
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,870
Alice Quinn?

287
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,559
If anyone, she could.

288
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,960
Can you read her mind?

289
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,273
No. Unlike you,
she's airtight.

290
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,512
But I can do one better.

291
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,838
Just light
the fucking thing.

292
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,194
Nicely done.

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,359
Perfect execution.

294
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,039
Too bad I know
you cheated.

295
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,513
Congratulations,
you two, and on to
the second Trial.

296
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,635
Well, what about...

297
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,952
Thinning the herd.

298
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,395
So are you gonna tell
me who we're meeting?

299
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,240
Yeah, she's not
a hedge witch exactly,

300
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,913
but, well, her and
I have some history.

301
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,957
So I think it's best...
What do you mean by "history"?

302
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,798
Hey, chickadee!

303
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,393
Mom, you shouldn't
be here.

304
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,955

This is your daughter.

305
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,589
What's she doing here?

306
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,875
She's a friend.

307
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,634
Okay, come on, babe.
Please, sit.

308
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,957
How are you?
How have you been?

309
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,077
(SCOFFS) Just tell me
what you want, Mom.

310
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,638
I want to give
you something.

311
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,869
Oh, that's so sweet!

312
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,190
Yeah, my birthday
was seven months ago.

313
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,556
Kady, look, I was not
in a good place

314
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,278
the last time
you saw me,

315
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,913
but my shit's
together now.

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,276
Oh, is it? ls that why
you're hanging out

317
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,998
with the angriest
bitch from the safe house?

318
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,833
Oh, if you want
to insult me, you
should try again.

319
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,149
Just“

320
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,755
Listen.

321
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,312
I called because
Julia and I have
a line on something.

322
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,433
Oh, my God,
here we go again.

323
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,155
We're gonna
start our own house.

324
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,119
Nothing crazy, but
it'll be safe from Marina,

325
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,113
so come with us.

326
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,278
My God, you're insane.

327
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,434
You actually think
that you can beat her.

328
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,392
Hey, Marina's strong,
but so are we.

329
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,316
Nothing like
that at school, huh?

330
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,629
Protection charm.

331
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,553
It'll render our
house literally invisible.

332
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,598
You know,
the amazing thing is

333
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,035
you actually believe that
this plan could work.

334
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,399
Marina will never
let me go.

335
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,310
Even

336
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,315
Oh, did Hannah give you
the whole sob story?

337
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,110
HANNAH: Kady...
No, no.

338
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,554
Marina didn't
betray my mom.

339
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,829
She cleaned up
her mess.

340
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,310
Yeah, Hannah, well,
she wanted to steal
something. Big heist, right?

341
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,232
Except she can't
handle her shit

342
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,072
under pressure,
and two people died.

343
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,753
Cut to now, Marina
gets to demand

344
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,478
that I steal shit
10 times a week.

345
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,999
Yeah, no big.

346
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,672
Don't call me again.

347
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,431
You can't take that!

348
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,431
No, we need it.
So does she.

349
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,356
If I had more,
I'd give you more.

350
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,109
Yeah.

351
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,469
But you don't.

352
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,273
You sold your
daughter to Marina?

353
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
No, Marina stole her.

354
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
Yeah, because of
a really bad judgment
call that you made.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,753
She said she had
my back. This is not
black and white.

356
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,956
Yeah, well, Kady sure
seems to think that it is.

357
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,554
If this goes how we want,
I can fix that, too.

358
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,914
"If this..."
Do you hear yourself?

359
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,070
"If this works out"?
I'm out.

360
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,674
Oh, no, you don't.
You do not cut me off.

361
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,673
My daughterjust
got brought into this.

362
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,873
And I will share with
you everything I can,

363
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,278
but it is better that I
see this through alone.

364
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,199
This looks like a home brew.
Where did you get it?

365
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,478
Found it inside
an old textbook.

366
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,069
(INHALES)

367
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,953
It looks underwhelming.

368
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,953
So how's Professor
March's research going?

369
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,435
Look, I tried,
but he won't take on
first year assistants.

370
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,150
Well, you'rejust
his type, so I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

371
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,630
"But where's
the door, Martin?

372
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,872
"There's always
a door to Fillory
when we really need it.

373
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,955
"In the clock,
or the closet,
or my panties?"

374
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,596
Come on, celebrate!
You passed, you dirty cheater.

375
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,236
What's the problem?
Speak.

376
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,278
No offense,
you're just not exactly...

377
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,397
Warm and cuddly?
I know.

378
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,553
You ever want
something so badly

379
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,916
and then realize
that it's nothing
like what you thought,

380
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,276
and maybe that
you are stupid

381
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,634
for ever actually
even wanting it?

382
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,513
Every guy I've
ever slept with.

383
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,433
Fillory is real.

384
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,477
Oh, come the fuck on.
It is.

385
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,075
Penny is a Traveler,

386
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,790
and he went there,
and it's real.

387
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,237
Look like your head's
about to pop off.

388
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,513
I loved those books.

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,070
You did?

390
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,275
Why so surprised?

391
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,311
I'd pretend I was
ambassador to
the Fillorian Outer Islands.

392
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,754
But the real thing,
it's not like the story.

393
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,189
So, what, it's actually
totally shitty over there?

394
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,949
I don't know.
Maybe. Yes.

395
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,839
At least a little.

396
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,912
The thing that attacked
us, that ripped
the Dean's eyes out,

397
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,399
seems like it might
be from Fillory.

398
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,833
Jesus.

399
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,154
That is not tonally
consistent with the books.

400
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,550
No, it's not.
And that... I just...

401
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,395
I find that devastating.

402
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,031
Were you planning
a trip there?

403
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,318
No, really.

404
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,792
Because, otherwise,
you're literally

405
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,235
torturing yourself
over a fairy tale.

406
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,032
Quentin, you passed
the first Trial.

407
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,918
You live to fight
another day.

408
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,118
Drink up. Go to the party.
Find someone to bang.

spear a fish?

I want to get my

Totally hilarious.

Oh, and to help you out.

438
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,793
No. Just no, okay?

439
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,675
Okay-

440
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,915

that we're not

because you need
10 extra digits.

look at me.

made mistakes.
