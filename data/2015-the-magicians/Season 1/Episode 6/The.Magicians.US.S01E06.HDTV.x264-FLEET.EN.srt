1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:01,435
Previously on <i>"The Magicians..."</i>

2
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:02,988
I knew The Beast would come.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,374
Get strong, learn fast,
any means necessary.

4
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:08,454
So that's it? That's all
you're gonna say to me?

5
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,861
I got into the school
and you didn't.

6
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,362
I don't know what else to say.

7
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:13,231
Marina is a psycho.

8
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,268
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

9
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,436
You don't know cut off.

10
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,172
Now the spells are missing
so I can keep going.

11
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:21,673
I want the new ones
that she stole.

12
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,008
They're locked
in the filing cabinet.

13
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,717
- You are a traveler.
- You can move between worlds.

14
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:29,871
Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

15
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:32,006
It works by binding your body
to Earth.

16
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:36,033
<i>Won't make the voices go away,
but it might keep you alive.</i>

17
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,947
All I can say is
it was some kind of dungeon.

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,744
This was in the walls.

19
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,117
Penny, I think you were
in Fillory.

20
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,250
You were in Fillory.

21
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:58,419
- You were in Fillory--
- Stop!

22
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,687
- Okay? Fillory is just a--
- Did you see any animals?

23
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,489
- Did they talk to you?
- I was at some dungeon,

24
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,890
you Hobbit-loving freak.

25
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:03,992
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,158
There are no Hobbits in Fillory.

27
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,494
It--It doesn't matter.

28
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,161
Ah, the drawing, the crest,
it means that you were

29
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,697
in a certain Fillorian castle.

30
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,832
- Kill me.
- It was built by dwarves.

31
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,034
Ah, okay, let's not get
caught up in the details.

32
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:17,471
The--the point is that
the--it's full of a--

33
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:19,339
a ton of incredibly
magical shit.

34
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,441
Oh, yeah, The Beast
is really fucking magical.

35
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:22,583
Let me pop back over there

36
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:25,045
and see if he does
birthday parties.

37
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,347
Let's go.
It's a waste of time.

38
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:29,249
I think you should listen
to Quentin.

39
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,884
Because I'm assuming
you didn't travel to Fillory

40
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:34,120
on some planned vacation.

41
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:36,155
So you don't know
how to control it yet.

42
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,391
Then educate yourself.

43
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:41,728
Nobody knows more about Fillory
than Quentin.

44
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,329
What if you end up back
there again?

45
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:45,532
She makes a point.

46
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:51,537
Okay, fanboy.

47
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,172
Tell me what it says
in the books

48
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:55,034
about not getting my face
eaten by The Beast.

49
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,145
The Beast isn't in the books.

50
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:01,113
How's that, if I was right
there staring him in the face?

51
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:02,975
The Chatwins, they mostly
get chased around

52
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,883
by this Time Witch,
the Watcher Woman.

53
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:08,020
She plants clocks in trees.

54
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:09,788
Ah, it's sort of surrealist.

55
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,557
Okay, I take it back.
This is a waste of your time.

56
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,724
The books were written for kids,

57
00:02:12,826 --> 00:02:14,106
so maybe they skipped
the monster

58
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,561
that rips out people's eyes.

59
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,930
- I don't know!
- Okay.

60
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:19,364
We're done here.

61
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:22,233
You love Fillory so much,
I hope you get to go.

62
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:23,535
I really do.

63
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,448
I guess I've been trying
to convince myself that

64
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,249
Penny's somehow
wrong about Fillory

65
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:41,351
despite having
actually been there.

66
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,090
That's a pretty acrobatic
form of denial.

67
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:49,426
I really am sorry.

68
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,463
I'm sure Fillory got you
through a lot as a kid.

69
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:54,732
Yeah.

70
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,033
As a kid...

71
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,670
Sorry, the manager
isn't in right now.

72
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,439
Would you like
to place an order?

73
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,341
I know you know who I am.

74
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:06,343
Look, I'm sorry
I insulted you guys.

75
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:10,114
But just who talked to you?
Marina? Pete?

76
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:11,582
I'm going to call the cops.

77
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,683
God, Rick, grow a pair!

78
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,118
Wait, wait, wait.

79
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,519
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:18,154
Please.

81
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,290
I don't know anyone else.

82
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:29,232
I'm not done with you.

83
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,536
Consider it as a warning.

84
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,513
Julia.

85
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:47,282
Julia, wait.
Just, just, wait.

86
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,217
Marina, okay?

87
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,986
No one wants a war.

88
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:54,356
Here.

89
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,324
It's about an hour by train.

90
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:57,893
Went there couple years back.

91
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:01,196
They're real.
They are good.

92
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:02,631
Just give them a try, but...

93
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:07,169
Please, don't come
back here again.

94
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,482
How'd you learn all this anyway?

95
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,951
Me and a friend got deep
into ink spells in high school.

96
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,022
It's not the Mona Lisa, but...

97
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:30,758
I do have 20/20 vision
in the dark.

98
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,664
And where was all this exactly?

99
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,832
I told you.

100
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,568
I'm basically from the 'burbs.

101
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,403
Actually, you never say
a damn thing about your life.

102
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:46,607
'cause it's boring.

103
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,041
What flavor of boring?

104
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,479
My mom died young.

105
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:54,848
And...

106
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,451
My dad is kind of embarrassing.

107
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:02,288
He wears Birkenstocks
and he sells weed.

108
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:06,626
But he loves me no matter
what kind of trouble I get in.

109
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,462
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

110
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:12,498
So, this symbol, it do anything
for the mind slut shit?

111
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:17,437
Yeah, you know,
Brakebills is good.

112
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,138
Everyone knows how to pull
their blinds down, you know?

113
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,574
Yeah.

114
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:24,444
I still hear her, though.

115
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:26,746
That girl from the dungeon...

116
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,414
I can't shut her out.

117
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,083
I just file that under

118
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:34,653
"Wish there was jack shit
I could do about it."

119
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:35,756
Yeah.

120
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,857
Or were you talking
about The Beast?

121
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,360
If I was you, I'd be curious.

122
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:44,663
He's full-on AWOL,
not a peep.

123
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,665
So, I get this,

124
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,167
and I don't poke the bear.

125
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,804
Let's just hope the bear
has better shit to do.

126
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:20,531
Shit, shit, shit.

127
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,019
Hey!

128
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:43,987
Why are you following me, lady?

129
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:47,990
Easy.
I just want to show you.

130
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:51,027
I'm just like you.

131

132
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,682
Hello?

133
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:19,989
Is someone being creepy
on purpose?

134
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,668
Secure the sacrifice!

135
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,170
Oh, God damn it.
No!

136
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:20,347
Oh, Manon!

137
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,117
We offer up this virgin.

138
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,185
Flesh and blood.

139
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,987
Jesus, I'm not a virgin.

140
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,255
Huh.

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,100
Life is full of surprises.

142
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:32,268
What the hell, Margo?

143
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,594
Follow, follow.
Hurry, hurry.

144
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:39,708
Ow. Guys, the pine needles
are hurting my feet.

145
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,244
Shh.

146
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,649
Ow, ow.

147
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,865
Hello, first years.

148
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,368
At this appointed hour,

149
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,469
as tradition dictates,

150
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,105
it falls upon the upper class

151
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:15,110
to administer what is known
simply as "The Trials."

152
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:21,816
The Trials test your ability

153
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:27,354
to think and act
like a Magician.

154
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:31,459
Pass, your journey begins.

155
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:35,996
Fail, you flunk out.

156
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:39,666
This is a test engineered
to thin out the herd.

157
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:43,503
Only those who should
will survive.

158
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:47,207
Oh, nut up, this isn't Harvard.

159
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,909
It requires actual effort.

160
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:52,512
And don't bother to go
complaining to the faculty.

161
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:54,848
They're off
on a luxurious retreat,

162
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,750
observing from a distance.

163
00:09:56,852 --> 00:10:00,654
You are ours, miscreants.

164
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:03,990
Onward to glory!

165
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,859
Come on.
Go!

166
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:08,227
Go!

167
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,728
- Move, move, move!
- Hurry up.

168
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,698
Name, please.

169
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
Alice Quinn.

170
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:27,202
Hmm.

171
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:29,270
Let me see.

172
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,839
Alice Quinn.

173
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:33,258
Wow, you're really enjoying
this aren't you?

174
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:36,294
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

175
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,163
The Trials themselves
have the power, Alice.

176
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:42,700
They will pass or fail you
as the Dean created them to.

177
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:45,803
I merely keep a little eye
on each and everyone of you.

178
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:50,508
Ah, there you are.

179
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,344
Report to the table
on your placard.

180
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,715
Good luck.

181
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,717
Next!

182
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,459
Say one word about Fillory
and I'll kill you.

183
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,660
Don't get me kicked out.

184
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,162
Well, then we'd finally be even.

185
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,296
Now I get it.

186
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,731
Get what?

187
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,300
Why our team name is
"Horny Chupacabras."

188
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,569
I'm not a...

189
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,504
I don't even know
what a "chupacabra" is.

190
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,206
It's a spine-covered
goat-sucking primate

191
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,807
indigenous to Mexico.

192
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,876
I can already see
we are immensely handicapped

193
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,244
by your presence.

194
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,649
In 18th century England,

195
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,918
a secret society
known as "The Brethren"

196
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,257
encrypted hundreds of spells
to hide them from the church.

197
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:43,259
You may open your blue books.

198
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:49,432
Each team must decode and cast
their spell by 9:00 a.m.

199
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,600
Screw up,

200
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:53,168
and it's back to page one.

201
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,704
FYI, this test
is pretty much impossible.

202
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:57,138
Begin!

203
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:08,883
Back in the day,
we'd travel the world.

204
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:10,618
We'd pay for spells,

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,387
trade for 'em.

206
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:16,191
And they weren't all the most
ambitious Hedges you ever saw,

207
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,659
but we looked out
for each other.

208
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:20,361
It was like family.

209
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:25,265
First family I really felt
I belonged in, actually.

210
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,670
Okay, so what do you
want exactly?

211
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:31,572
Well...

212
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:35,309
You know, our story with Marina,
it's not rare.

213
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,178
I have seen her chew people up
and spit them out.

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,681
Then what? You swoop in,
you buy us a milkshake?

215
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,149
Come on.

216
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,719
Not till today.

217
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:50,157
You are the first I believe
can really do things,

218
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:52,493
if...

219
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,996
given the opportunity to learn.

220
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,865
I mean, I can feel it
coming off you.

221
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,001
You're not an amateur.

222
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:02,602
You're the real thing.

223
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:08,842
Yeah, well,
some think so, some do not.

224
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:12,545
Well, I think
we can help each other.

225
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:14,213
How?

226
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,852
It's not much,

227
00:13:19,954 --> 00:13:21,954
but, you know, they'll be
new to you, I think.

228
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,257
Wait a minute.

229
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,858
- How did you--
- All over.

230
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,727
- Where did you--
- You don't want to know.

231
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,829
But you're welcome to 'em.

232
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:32,531
In exchange for what?

233
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:35,100
Just do some with me.

234
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:39,404
I miss the feeling, you know.

235
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,773
Welcome...
à la Safe House Julia.

236
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:04,929
Can you make it colder?

237
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:12,369
Girl, you're strong!

238
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,975
Shit.

239
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:20,310
Was this the last of them?

240
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,745
I'm afraid so.

241
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:31,821
Well, hey, we'll hit the road.

242
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:34,057
Right? Find new stuff.

243
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,092
Try, at least.

244
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,061
But you know who has
a ton of new stuff?

245
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,163
Marina.

246
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:45,100
'Cause she got
her memories back.

247
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,302
I helped her do it.

248
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:47,903
She has...

249
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:51,173
Brakebills.

250
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,442
So she has everything.

251
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,147
We're screwed.

252
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,409
How much time do we have left?

253
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,649
I don't know.

254
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,151
Who knows how to read
an hourglass?

255
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,652
This is impossible.

256
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,654
Even Eliot said
it was impossible.

257
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,125
Wait, it's impossible.

258
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,360
Actually he said, it was
practically impossible.

259
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:14,028
But maybe some genius
can do this.

260
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,197
So what?
Geniuses can be magicians?

261
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,866
- Yeah.
- Really?

262
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:21,135
We have to cheat.

263
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,471
They want us to.
We've been Kobayashi Maru'd.

264
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,172
Whatever that means, yes.

265
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:26,341
No.

266
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:27,842
- No way.
- You're an idiot.

267
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,944
- We're cheating.
- Why would--

268
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:32,446
Why would they want us to cheat?

269
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,281
Because we're magicians.

270
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,816
No. No.

271
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:37,218
They're just want to see
how far we can get.

272
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,487
There is no such a thing
as half a spell.

273
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,057
You guys are insane.

274
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,692
Supply closet.

275
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,961
Five minutes.

276
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,696
I've got a plan.

277
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:54,834
Oh, man.

278
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:57,704
They really upped
the security since my day.

279
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,706
How much do you know
about those wards?

280
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,307
Enough to know they're strong.

281
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,176
But not enough
to break them, so...

282
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,744
What do you think would happen
if we just ran in there

283
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:05,745
and grabbed the filing cabinet?

284
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,414
Oh, yeah, sure.

285
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:09,883
You ever see the movie
"Scanners"?

286
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,918
Oh.

287
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,352
There's a way.

288
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,354
There's always a way.

289
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,395
Do you have a pen?

290
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,096
Here.

291
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,368
Mm, what we need...

292
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,504
Think of it like a fishhook.

293
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:33,272
We grab the cabinets
from the room,

294
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:34,706
without tripping wards.

295
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,842
There's wards all over the room.

296
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:39,244
Yeah, in this dimension, sure.

297
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:42,247
The one thing I can't figure out
is how to get the hook in.

298
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:46,118
You know, we need someone
inside for that.

299
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,288
And I sort of burned
all my bridges with that.

300
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,290
You think we can pay
someone off?

301
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:54,959
No.

302
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:57,929
I know someone.

303
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:04,847
Took you long enough.

304
00:17:05,987 --> 00:17:07,387
Okay, here is the question.

305
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:08,929
Do you believe
what you said earlier,

306
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,255
that a genius could solve
this by dawn?

307
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,456
Well yeah, I mean,
if they were--

308
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,592
Alice Quinn?

309
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:15,160
If anyone, she could.

310
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:16,862
Can you read her mind?

311
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,397
No.

312
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,133
Unlike you, she's airtight.

313
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,301
But I can do one better.

314
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,519
Just light the fucking thing.

315
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:28,298
Nicely done.

316
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,300
Perfect execution.

317
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:34,971
Too bad I know you cheated.

318
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,809
Congratulations, you two,

319
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,378
and on to the second trial.

320
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:46,516
Well, what about--

321
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,918
Thinning the herd.

322
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,130
So, are you gonna tell me
who we're meeting?

323
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:03,633
Yeah, she--she's not
a hedge witch exactly.

324
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,834
Well, her and I have
some history.

325
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:06,835
So, I think--

326
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,036
What do you mean by "history"?

327
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,505
Hey, chickadee.

328
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,767
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

329
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:13,642
Ah, this is your daughter.

330
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,310
What's she doing here?

331
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:16,578
She's a friend.

332
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,047
Okay, come on, babe, please.
Sit.

333
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:25,253
How are you?
How you've been?

334
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:27,756
Just tell me what you want, Mom.

335
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:29,157
I want to give you something.

336
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:30,725
Oh, that's so sweet.

337
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,927
Yeah, my birthday
was seven months ago.

338
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,163
Kady, look, I was not
in a good place

339
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:36,998
the last time you saw me,

340
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,733
- but my shit's together now.
- Oh, is it?

341
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,169
Is that why you're hanging out

342
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:42,870
with the angriest bitch
from the safe house?

343
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:45,540
Oh, if you want to insult me,
try again.

344
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,175
Just--

345
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,010
Listen.

346
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:53,247
I called because Julia and I
have a line on something.

347
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:55,115
Oh, my God, here we go again.

348
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:58,052
We're gonna start our own house.

349
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:01,889
Nothing crazy,
but it'll be safe...

350
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,857
from Marina.

351
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,259
So come with us.

352
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,128
Oh, my God, you're insane.

353
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,398
You actually think
that you can beat her.

354
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,568
Hey, Marina's strong,
but so are we.

355
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:23,776
Nothing like that
at school, huh?

356
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,912
Protection charm.

357
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,915
It'll render a house
literally invisible.

358
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:31,117
You know, the amazing thing

359
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:35,287
is you actually believe
that this plan could work.

360
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,257
Marina will never let me go.

361
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,493
Ever.

362
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,296
Oh, did Hannah give you
the whole sob history?

363
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:45,631
- Kady.
- No, no.

364
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,500
Marina didn't betray my mom.
She cleaned up her mess.

365
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:49,702
Yeah, Hannah, she wanted
to steal something.

366
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:51,036
Big heist, right?

367
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,071
Except she can't handle
her shit under pressure

368
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:55,907
and two people died.

369
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:56,908
Cut to now,
Marina gets to demand that

370
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,811
I steal shit ten times a week.

371
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:02,047
Yeah, no big.

372
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:07,119
Don't call me again.

373
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:08,854
- Hey, you can't take that.
- Let her have it.

374
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,322
- No, we need it.
- So does she.

375
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:13,091
If I had more,

376
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:15,227
I'd give you more.

377
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:18,529
Yeah.

378
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:19,964
But you don't.

379
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,569
You sold your daughter
to Marina?

380
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:27,538
No.
Marina stole her.

381
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:30,275
Yeah, because of a really
bad judgment call that<i> you</i> made.

382
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:33,110
She said she had my back.
This is not black and white.

383
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:35,379
Yeah, well, Kady sure seems
to think that it is.

384
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:36,747
If this goes how we want,

385
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,015
I can fix that too.

386
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:39,383
If this--
Do you hear yours--

387
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:40,617
"If this works out"?
I'm out.

388
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,719
Oh, no, you don't.

389
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,220
You do not cut me off.

390
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:46,023
My daughter just got brought
into this.

391
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,393
And I will share with you
everything I can.

392
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:52,862
But it is better that
I see this through alone.

393
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:07,143
This looks like a home brew.

394
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:08,711
Where did you get it?

395
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,814
Found it inside an old textbook.

396
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:14,083
It looks underwhelming.

397
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:17,753
So how's Professor March's
research going?

398
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,990
Look, I tried, but he won't
take on first year assistants.

399
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:22,658
Well, you're just his type.

400
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,528
So I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

401
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:41,910
"But where is the door, Martin?

402
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,678
"There is always a door
to Fillory

403
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,480
"when we really need it,

404
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,949
"in the clock or the closet...

405
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,078
or my panties..."

406
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:52,802
Come on, celebrate.

407
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,555
You passed, you dirty cheater.

408
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:56,691
What's the problem?

409
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,192
Speak.

410
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,927
No offense,
you're just not exactly--

411
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,062
Warm and cuddly?

412
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:04,498
I know.

413
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,366
You ever want something so badly

414
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,768
and then realize that it's
nothing like what you thought?

415
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,004
And maybe that you are stupid

416
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:12,439
for ever actually
even wanting it.

417
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,541
Every guy I've ever slept with.

418
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,909
Fillory is real.

419
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,343
Oh, come on.

420
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,345
It is.

421
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:20,780
Penny is a traveler.

422
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:21,882
And he went there.

423
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,516
And...

424
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,384
it's real.

425
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,121
You look like your head's
about to pop off.

426
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,356
I loved those books.

427
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,359
- You did?
- Why so surprised?

428
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:37,296
I'd pretend I was Ambassador
to the Fillorian Outer Islands.

429
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:40,433
But the real thing,
it's not like the story.

430
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:44,970
So, what, it's actually
totally shitty over there?

431
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:46,872
I don't know.
Maybe.

432
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,874
Yes.

433
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:51,243
At least a little.

434
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:54,279
The thing that attacked us
that ripped the Dean's eyes out,

435
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:58,717
seems like it might be
from Fillory.

436
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,552
Jesus.

437
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:03,555
That is not tonally consistent
with the books.

438
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:04,857
No, it's not.

439
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,591
And that--
I just--I--

440
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:08,760
I find that...

441
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:10,262
devastating.

442
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:12,430
Were you planning a trip there?

443
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,367
No. Really.

444
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:17,035
Because, otherwise,
you're literally

445
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:19,471
torturing yourself
over a fairy tale.

446
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:23,607
Quentin,
you passed the first trial.

447
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,144
You live to fight another day.
Drink up.

448
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,713
Go to the party.
Find someone to bang.

449
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,949
Celebrate the world you're in,
dummy.

450
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:33,885
Come on!

451
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:38,622
Okay.

452
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:41,825
Wow, I'm a little--

453
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,628
I am very--

454
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,764
Wow, I'm really, ah--

455
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,567
Margo, did you roofie me?

456
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:18,663
Can we just skip down
to where you realize

457
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,604
you no makey magic here?

458
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,674
Oh, cucumber.

459
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,540
Daddy's favorite.

460
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:31,501
And too much dill.

461
00:25:31,603 --> 00:25:33,469
There they all are.

462
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,640
All those little fishies,
just like us.

463
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:41,076
Eating, shitting, breeding.

464
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,380
I require one.

465
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:45,814
It's over there.

466
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,116
Chop, chop.

467
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:50,419
I am literally losing
the will to live.

468
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:51,654
So, this is my next test?

469
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:53,322
I'm supposed to...

470
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:54,890
spear a fish?

471
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:57,626
Do your lips move when you read?

472
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:07,636
Seriously? One arrow?

473
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,506
Eliot!

474
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,036
Bring him to me.

475
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:43,705
Why?

476
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:47,541
I want to get
my Catherine the Great on.

477
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:49,176
Google it.

478
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:50,944
Totally hilarious.

479
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:54,381
Oh, and to help you out...

480
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:57,084
No.

481
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,186
Just no.
Okay?

482
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:01,154
Okay.

483
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:03,757
Wait.

484
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,326
I'm seeing your future now.

485
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:08,962
Gay porn?

486
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:18,205
Oh, my<i> favorito.</i>

487
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:21,341
Liver.

488
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,198
Julia!
Julia, stop.

489
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,366
You're gonna blow yourself up.

490
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,367
I was getting it.

491
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:50,803
You really weren't, hon.

492
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:51,971
How did you get in?

493
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:54,506
I unpicked your ward.

494
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:57,576
I would go with
Koyosegi next time.

495
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,718
Thank you for the advice.
Now, can you please leave?

496
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:01,680
We already agreed that
we're not partners, okay?

497
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,782
Well, it didn't work.

498
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,950
Because you need
ten extra digits.

499
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:09,187
Actually, I don't.
I--

500
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,490
It's interesting
how you can't look at me.

501
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,759
You know why?

502
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,229
'Cause I'm too familiar.

503
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,366
I mean, we both made mistakes,
we live with them,

504
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:26,337
we go on, alone, if we have to.

505
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,306
But you do this alone,

506
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:31,609
and you will get hurt.

507
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,845
Come on.

508
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,047
We can help each other out.

509
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,984
Please.

510
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,556
I want my daughter back.

511
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,666
Kady?

512
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,170
Kady.
Hey, Kady.

513
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,552
- Kady, Kady.
- Stop it, stop it.

514
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,574
- Stop it. Let go, let go.
- Hey, no, no.

515
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,142
- I have to catch the bird.
- Hey.

516
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,812
This shit is dumb.
The school is not worth it.

517
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,193
No, I can't, you don't get it.

518
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,914
I can't get kicked out.

519
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,416
Oh, fuck!

520
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,584
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

521
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,052
- Jesus.
- Is it broken?

522
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,253
I don't know.

523
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,588
- Ow!
- Let me see, let me see.

524
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,223
- Ow.
- Let me look at it.

525
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:22,490
- It's not broken.
- Look, talk to me.

526
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,359
What's going on?

527
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:26,761
Look, it's just--

528
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:28,663
This is all I have.

529
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,566
Me too.

530
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:34,135
No, it's different.

531
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:36,905
I'm different.

532
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,474
Look, I need Brakebills.

533
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:45,780
It's life or death.
I have to be here.

534
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:03,017
Hey, what are you supposed
to get with that?

535
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,800
A pheasant.

536
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,070
- You?
- A horse.

537
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,640
These people are crazy.

538
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:18,812
Let's go find the others.

539
00:30:18,914 --> 00:30:21,848
Come on.

540
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:26,986
Yo!

541
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,421
Whoa!

542
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,324
Seriously, dude,
I almost had him.

543
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:34,160
We'll get him, son.

544
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:38,898
It's not about magic,
'cause it's about

545
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,734
talking to each other.

546
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:43,669
All right, you got that.

547
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:45,270
But I grew up in Florida,

548
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:49,074
so I actually know how to use it
to get your fish.

549
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:51,276
But I'm after a horse.

550
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:54,513
- Seriously?
- What?

551
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:57,650
Junior Cowboy Camp.

552
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,952
Pheasant.

553
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,190
Tree.

554
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:30,515
You're bleeding.

555
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:32,584
I hated Junior Cowboy Camp.

556
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:36,854
Timber!

557
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:41,525
Bravo!

558
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:43,361
Brava!
Brava.

559
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:45,796
That's it, we passed.

560
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:48,565
After you chop the tree
into firewood,

561
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,400
whip us up
a little grilled salmon...

562
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,736
Some honeyed pheasant.

563
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:55,672
And take turns
blowing the horse.

564
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:21,531
Did you see the look
on Quentin's face?

565
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,834
Like, "Fine,
but I am not going first."

566
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,565
I'm sure by now you've realized

567
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:33,458
Brakebills teaches us to be arch
and ironic about magic.

568
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,312
But this one plays it serious.

569
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,381
You must bare yourself

570
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,749
in the presence
of another magical adept

571
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:46,755
and expose your highest-governing
internal circumstance,

572
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:48,824
which is to say,

573
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:52,595
your utmost truth.

574
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,797
You have till midnight.

575
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,603
Ready?

576
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:40,641
Oh, shit!

577
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:48,348
Shit.

578
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,386
No!

579
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,975
Okay, it's a two person spell.

580
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:20,046
Both must succeed to unlock it.

581
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:22,381
You bind your hands
with this rope.

582
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:25,350
How am I gonna survive?

583
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:28,020
It'll fall off once
you've reached transcendence.

584
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:29,855
It's gotta be some kind
of scheme, right?

585
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:32,024
To record us playing
naked truth or dare,

586
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:33,525
so they can blackmail us
or something.

587
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,195
Unfortunately,
Margo wasn't lying.

588
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:40,432
It's arcane
and a bit unorthodox,

589
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:44,203
but secrets magic
is a real thing.

590
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:47,906
Basically, there is no trick
or cheat to this.

591
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:50,709
It's kind of the exact opposite.

592
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:13,797
Focus.

593
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:15,899
I'm trying.

594
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:26,343
All clear.
Good to go.

595
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:32,983
Hey.

596
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,957
Oh, my God.

597
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:41,824
Oh, my God, no.

598
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,248
Run.

599
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:51,600
Hannah.

600
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:52,601
Hannah!

601
00:35:52,703 --> 00:35:54,637
You--you said it was all clear.

602
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:56,004
You said it was gonna be okay.

603
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:58,340
Run!
Marina is coming.

604
00:35:58,442 --> 00:36:00,122
We need to get help.
We need to get help.

605
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:03,246
<i>911.
What is your emergency?</i>

606
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:21,273
I know it's not part of the spell,

607
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:25,581
but I think it could
make things easier.

608
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:29,117
You know, I always thought
when...

609
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,634
I partook in a nude
magic ritual,

610
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:36,892
that I'd be sort of
in a mystical trance.

611
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,231
Tell that to the girl
who lost her virginity

612
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,833
with all her clothes on.

613
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,671
Okay.

614
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:15,363

Okay.

620
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:59,472
Ah...

621
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:02,809
I've been institutionalized
more than once.

622
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,117
Maybe we shouldn't drink.

623
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:14,520
Or we should drink more.

624
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:18,457
Yeah.

625
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,126
William.

626
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:21,594
Really?

627
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,362
Ask me something harder

628
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:26,298

Ask me why I'm nice to you.

631
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:39,111
I had noticed you're a tad
brusque with everyone else.

632
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,781
And why is that?

633
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:45,416
Penny, you don't have to.

634
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:47,552
Look, I'm not...
scared to tell you this

635
00:38:47,654 --> 00:38:51,056
because it's true.

636
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:52,624
Shit!

637
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:56,228
Okay.

638
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,363
Truth.

639
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,431
I am scared to tell you this,

640
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,467
because it's true.

641
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:07,572

00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,278
I can't--I can't do this.

645
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,913
Kady, I'm not--
I'm not gonna chase after you.

646
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:17,782
You won't have to.

647
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:21,018
What does that mean?

648
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,286
Look, I'm a liar!

649
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,588
Okay?

650
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,923
Okay, I flirted with you
that first day

651
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:27,691
because you looked useful,
and you were.

652
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:31,161
We stole a lot of shit,
so there it is.

653
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,463
I've been using you
this entire time.

654
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,600
It's all a lie.

Five,

four,

three,

two...

662
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:03,492
One.

663
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:06,995
I need to sit.

664
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:16,839
I really didn't see this coming.

665
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:20,408
How could you?
You're the best.

666
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,111
You know what?

667
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,680
I try so hard not to be.

668
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:27,649
Why?

669
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:30,685
I'm already
pretty damn unpopular.

670
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,454
Can you imagine what
they would think

671
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,289
if they knew how good
I really am?

672
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:41,463
"Spinster magician dies alone,
eaten by cats."

673
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:48,837
I always hold back, Quentin.

674
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,338
Every single day.
I mean...

675
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,042
I have no idea
what I'm even capable of.

676
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:58,712
And I'm just trying so hard
to be anything close to normal.

677
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:02,016
My friend Julia said
that I--

678
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:04,551
I couldn't run away hard enough.

679
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,689
She's right.

680
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,061
I run and I...

681
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:18,231
I find secret doors--

682
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:21,368
Whether I'm alone or in a group,
it doesn't matter.

683
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,734
I--Like, I'm here.

684
00:41:23,854 --> 00:41:25,688
I'm in this amazing place.

685
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,057
I have literal magic in my life
and I'm still running.

686
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,095
I'm still this person
that I fucking hate.

687
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:37,699
Sorry.

688
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:39,634
I think I'm really drunk
right now.

689
00:41:39,736 --> 00:41:42,104
It's okay, Quentin.
I get it.

690
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:46,207
Your ropes are gone.

691
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,777
Yeah, so are yours.
