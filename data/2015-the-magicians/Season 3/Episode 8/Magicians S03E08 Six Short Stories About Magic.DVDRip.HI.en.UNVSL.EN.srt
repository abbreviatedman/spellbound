00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,526
QUENTIN: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,728
Fray isn't yours.

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,773
Your real daughter
died during childbirth.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,898
She died?

5
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,151
IRENE: <i>All right,
I can help you.</i>

6
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,473
Is that cocaine?

7
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,012
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

8
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,203
(SNIFFS)

9
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,448
Penny, Sylvia. I'm
babysitting now?

10
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,950
Sylvia is your supervisor.

11
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,795
If you can't bring me
back, you die too, Penny.

12
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,118
Benedict, do not do it!

13
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,417
No!

14
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,293
Mmm. Yummy.

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,625
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

16
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,254
for some time.

17
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,491
She planned this.

18
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:35,365
(SCREAMING) I'm your
queen, you motherfuckers!

19
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,066
What're you doing?

20
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,499
Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

21
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,584
Wait a minute, I
know these people.

22
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,304
THE LIBRARIAN:
Well, every book is here,

23
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,217
all the books of all the
people who ever lived.

24
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,890
It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

25
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,473
So we need a gatekeeper.

26
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,692
POPPY: <i>What about
the Library's dragon?</i>

27
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,446
They call it the Bookwyrm.

28
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,747
I hear they use it

29
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,364
to send books to and
from the Underworld.

30
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,619
Well, what if the
person was a book?

31
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,349
Say I get the key
and send it back up,

32
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,803
it's stuck in the
Satellite Library.

33
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,455
We need another Traveler.

34
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,861
Okay, I work with
this group now.

35
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,400
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

36
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,911
You have to go, if that's
what you wanna do.

37
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,460
I'm sorry we're cursed.

38
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,788
Whoa!

39
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,487
Damn it!

40
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,667
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,317
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

42
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,372
Hey, uh, guy...

43
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,401
Yeah, what is this?

44
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,841
Temp housing,
and before you ask,

45
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,571
yes, the system is still down.

46
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,910
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,141
The outhouses to your left.

48
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,907
Outhouses here?
No, look, I... I'm...

49
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,315
I'm just looking for someone.

50
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,478
Did you file a request?

51
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,881
You'll have to hand-deliver
it to the Underworld Hotel.

52
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,859
This is an emergency,
okay? I really, really can't wait.

53
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,389
I might be able to
help, unofficially,

54
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,794
if, uh...

55
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,566
Yeah, uh...

56
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,966
What the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

57
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,800
Uh, is there money here?

58
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,664
And what about
the White Walkers?

59
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,073
Oh, the White Walkers?

60
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,736
Yeah, I mean, those
guys are bad news.

61
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,522
You know, but then the
British-sounding dude

62
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,990
came and, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

63
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,449
Wait, who was that? You know!

64
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,314
You know, dope outfit.

65
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,512
Speaks in rhymes.
Has eight dragons.

66
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,583
Where did he get
so many dragons?

67
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,353
I mean, that's the question.

68
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,956
So, you know, he came in

69
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,588
and, uh, won the throne game.

70
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,034
Well, no one does
a twist like they do.

71
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,426
Okay, what's your friend's name?

72
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,471
Hi, um, I'm looking
for Benedict.

73
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,598
BENEDICT: Go away. Benedict?

74
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,301
I'm dead! Go away!

75
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,071
It's... It's Penny.

76
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,544
Oh, Penny, my friend!

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,376
Oh. Okay. Um...

78
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,779
Good hug.

79
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,314
Yeah, let's call this, man.

80
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,147
You can't imagine
how terrible this place is.

81
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,817
I'm so happy to see you.

82
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,018
That isn't to say...
I'm sorry you're dead.

83
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,453
Yeah, about that...

84
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,359
No, I'm... I'm not technically.

85
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,624
I came to find you.

86
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,495
You did? Yeah.

87
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,566
Okay, we're...

88
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,932
And we're hugging again.

89
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,533
When you died, were
you holding a key?

90
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,172
Are you here for the key?

91
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,646
Yeah, do you have
it? I thought you, uh...

92
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,109
Because we were
friends, that, um...

93
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,614
Oh. Um...

94
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,521
Yeah, look, we're
not not friends.

95
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,920
It's just, you know,

96
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,015
I'm on a mission,
and if we are friends...

97
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,151
I am your friend!
Then give me the key,

98
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,422
please?

99
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,357
They took it. Who?

100
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,960
Well, the Library.

101
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,733
Of course. Fuck me.

102
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,030
I just snuck out
of there. Damn it!

103
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,616
Well, the Library's the
only part of the Underworld

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,041
that functions now.
It's well-protected.

105
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,702
I'd say just cut your losses.

106
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,178
There's no way
you can get in there.

107
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,672
Yeah, there is.

108
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,880
I'm a Librarian.

109
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,646
Currently on the lam
from a billion-year contract.

110
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,385
Oh, well, like I said...

111
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,945
Best let go of it.

112
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,119
Of all of magic?

113
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,492
Would you let that go?

114
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,731
Well, I'll figure it out,

115
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,699
find the key, avoid
indentured servitude...

116
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,564
Even in death, you
lead an exciting life.

117
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,898
I'll help No, that's okay.

118
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,437
No, I insist! I can
help you sneak.

119
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,767
I can...

120
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,032
Great. Yeah!

121
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,806
We'll go together.

122
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,487
I just... You know, I just
need to find one more person...

123
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,604
Okay.

124
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,712
And then, we'll loop back
and grab you in 10, okay?

125
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,908
Okay, no hugging. Okay.

126
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,211
All right. I'll be here.

127
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,843
I'm gonna go this way. Okay.

128
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,000
Hi, Penny. Sylvia?

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,896
You're about to do
something stupid.

130
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,670
I'm sorry...

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,044
For leaving you behind in...

132
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,744
Oh, you mean in the Poison Room?

133
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,008
God, I was a goner.

134
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,811
I'm not mad. I am.

135
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,146
Well, don't be.

136
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,810
I'm fine, well, for a dead girl.

137
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,798
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

138
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,586
between the
stuck-in-the-astral thing

139
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,421
and the
'bout-to-fuck-up-royally thing.

140
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,551
How do you know I'm...

141
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,153
Oh. The same way I knew
that you were here right now.

142
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,562
It is written. What is that?

143
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,568
Trust me, your best
bet of finding that key

144
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,729
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

145
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,238
Follow me.

146
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,119
Cassandra? I brought a friend.

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
Alice?

148
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,733
(SCREAMS)

149
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,207
(SCREAMS)

150
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,075
Cassandra, calm down. It's okay.

151
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,207
It's okay. What
the hell is going on?

152
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,218
Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

153
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,778
I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

154
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,232
who, last time I
checked, was still alive.

155
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,485
I don't know what to tell you.

156
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,423
She's been here, like,
thousands of years.

157
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,256
Make him go away. I
can't. He needs your help.

158
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,626
Here's the deal.

159
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,736
Cassandra has a gift. A curse.

160
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,440
She kinda got
involved with this guy...

161
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,633
God.

162
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,210
And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

163
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,213
so he gave her magical sight.

164
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,748
She can see the future.

165
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,181
This should sound familiar,

166
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,718
if you've read
any ancient myths.

167
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,219
The one that no one believed

168
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,221
and it drove her batshit crazy?

169
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,881
Quiet, squirrels.

170
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,892
I guess some
Librarians found her

171
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,860
and got her to start
writing everything down.

172
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,055
Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

173
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,688
of the people in the Library?

174
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,925
Well, yes and no.

175
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,093
She can only
write one at a time.

176
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,660
So, at some point, the
Librarians wrote a spell

177
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,729
to, like, industrialize
her thing,

178
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,183
and that's how all
books were written.

179
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,766
That stopped when magic did,

180
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,004
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

181
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,778
Trying to concentrate.

182
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,377
Anyway, I take her
pages to the Bookwyrm,

183
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,849
and I read that you were here,

184
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,613
and then, I read that
I come to help you,

185
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,051
and so I did, and here we are.

186
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,731
Out of seven billion
people in the world,

187
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,984
she's writing about me?

188
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,389
Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

189
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,087
making you maybe our only hope.

190
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,389
No presh. So, what do we do?

191
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,090
Do we just... Do
we just wait for her

192
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,792
to maybe write
about the lost key?

193
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,866
(PAPER RUSTLING)

194
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,031
This one seems to be about
Poppy and Quentin... Oh!

195
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,236
God, it's a sex scene.

196
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,107
QUENTIN: <i>I'm worried
that the plan won't work.</i>

197
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,016
Well, that means my
plan definitely didn't work.

198
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,215
What plan is that?

199
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,490
The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

200
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,217
I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

201
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,121
It's incredibly dangerous,

202
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,755
and I don't think that we are

203
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,596
fully, you know, equipped.

204
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,660
I assure you, Quentin,

205
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,335
I'm fully equipped.

206
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,438
I can't ask you

207
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,669
to risk your life for my quest.

208
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:03,809
(SIGHS)

209
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,009
Real talk, I'm a very
self-interested person,

210
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,343
and I want magic back.

211
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,613
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

212
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,085
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

213
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,313
Maybe you have to bring me

214
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,085
or you totally fail. Hmm?

215
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,059
I don't think that's
how this works.

216
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,294
(SIGHS) If it's such a bad
idea, then why are you going?

217
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,198
Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

218
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,692
A quest is supposed
to change a quester.

219
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,835
The person who starts it

220
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,565
couldn't, you know, finish it.

221
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,801
So run a gauntlet
to get the keys,

222
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,675
and the gauntlet is
what makes you the guy

223
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,873
that can get the keys?

224
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:41,947
Exactly.

225
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,775
I know what I have to be

226
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,410
to win this quest.

227
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,782
A hero.

228
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,056
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

229
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,656
Okay...

230
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,864
I reject your whole premise.

231
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,566
That's all people
do: Try to change.

232
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,060
The real me is an
asshole with no filter.

233
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,468
Believe me, I tried.

234
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,433
Eventually, I realized

235
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,171
the brave thing is to be you

236
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,143
and accept the consequences.

237
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,643
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

238
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,292
Shit's about to
get awkward, huh.

239
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,821
Oh, because you slept with Q?

240
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,156
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

241
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,257
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

242
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,699
Robbing the Library?

243
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,767
Oh.

244
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,128
How are you even
gonna get there?

245
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,432
We have a Traveler. Victoria.

246
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,770
But how's she gonna travel you?

247
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,070
That part's a spell.

248
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,169
Yeah, so, we're not doing that.

249
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,838
Travelers are
magical creatures...

250
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,314
They're technically
hybrids. Fine, whatever.

251
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,448
All I know is that
we can use her DNA.

252
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,312
She's gonna build
a Mirror Bridge.

253
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,546
All we need is...

254
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,952
PHD-level skill and patience

255
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,925
and more Traveler blood
than she has in her entire body.

256
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,254
Exactly.

257
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,489
Look, I know the
physics of Mirror Bridges

258
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,964
from when I was a...
Sociopathic energy monster?

259
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,193
Yeah.

260
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,933
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

261
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,403
a hundred miles apart, max.

262
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,497
Well, we're better than hedges.

263
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,573
Light years better?

264
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,419
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

265
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,810
So if you're not
perfect, Victoria dies.

266
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:20,990
VICTORIA: Forget it. I'm out.

267
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,038
KADY: Okay, hold on.

268
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,107
I was on the fence when
it sounded semi-safe.

269
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,449
Now it sounds a lot like I
could get everyone killed.

270
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,097
Look, we don't do it until
we get the math right,

271
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,161
and I'll make sure that...

272
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,555
None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

273
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,287
Alice does.

274
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,225
Get her to do the
math, we can talk.

275
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,206
She said, "I already
talked to Alice.

276
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,254
"She's not gonna help."

277
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,856
Look, it's simple.

278
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,596
Prove to me the Bridge
will be stable, or I'm out.

279
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,069
Victoria, wait...

280
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,366
Oh, shit.

281
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,068
What do we do now?

282
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,343
(MOUTHING)

283
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,905
What is she after?

284
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,315
Harriet? What do you mean?

285
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,846
If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

286
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,219
we deserve to know why.

287
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,153
Okay.

288
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,996
Library's been
searching for this thing

289
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,862
called the Alexandria Cell.

290
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,332
It's a huge battery.

291
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,968
Librarians from
ancient Egypt made it,

292
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,699
and if they followed the
plans, it is fucking massive.

293
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,899
And Harriet thinks
that they found it?

294
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,504
Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

295
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,740
big magic.

296
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,110
But none of it matters

297
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,743
if we can't get to
the Satellite branch.

298
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,751
Niffin notes.

299
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,356
Pages and pages
about Mirror Bridges.

300
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,626
How did... How did you
convince her to help us?

301
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,364
Didn't. I stole them.

302
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,253
I'll make copies
and put them back

303
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,599
before she comes home

304
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,213
from wherever she went
to sulk and be a martyr.

305
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,570
No, this is not a good idea.

306
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,132
Under the circumstances,
it seemed worth it.

307
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,571

00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,574

00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,549
We'll hurry.

316
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,884
Thank you, Victoria.

317
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,047
Okay, she says, "Go
left down the hall."

318
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,549
Said, "You'll find
the book drop chute.

319
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,248
"The Bookwyrm's inside." Okay.

320
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,815

00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,147
So, Penny failed?

335
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,308
Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I...

336

Well, we can't just
stand here and wait.

337

to play in this quest.

to bail without me.

357
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,536
Well, "about to". That means
that there's still a chance.

358
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,904
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

359
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,794
And what the hell
is Alice is doing

360
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:38,888
in the Satellite branch?

361
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,831
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

362
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,394
Alice, if you're
in there, please...

363
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,465
Where is the key?

364
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,835
Fuck.

365
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,881
Here's a bright idea.
Keep fucking reading.

366
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,333
POPPY: <i>We're better than hedges.</i>

367
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,397
ALICE: <i>Light years better?</i>

368
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,350
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

369
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,455
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

370
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,531
Then help.

371
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,438
KADY: Look, bottom line, Alice,

372
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,906
you told Poppy the
Mirror Bridge won't work.

373
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,909
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

374
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,167
It won't work.

375
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,713
Would you rather
I didn't tell her

376
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:28,974
and just let you guys

377
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,243
walk off into deep space?

00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,816
(MOUTHING)

379
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,613
She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

380
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,285
Once.

381
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,626
I wasn't there long.

00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,728

00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,533

"But from who?"

385
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,330
Whom.

386
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,566
(OUT LOUD) I said "whom."

387

388
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,641

"The rest of us..."

391
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,525
You just wanna let all
that knowledge loose

for anyone to use?

393
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,746

The biggest
battery ever created.

400
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,796
You wanna help
Penny? This is how.

401
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,273
If I say yes, that
means risking lives

402
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,310
to give you power maybe
no one should have.

403
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,478
No thank you.

(DOOR RATTLING)

405
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,633
Door was stuck.

406
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,161
Can I have one of those?

407
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,933
FEN: So, I left.

408
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,633
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

409
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,742
It's "ball and chain,"
I think you mean.

410
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,806
No, that doesn't sound right.

411
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,618
I think I know what you mean.

412
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,280
I lost a lot of people recently,

413
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,192
including kind of myself.

414
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,352
Mmm. That makes no sense.

415
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,556
I had everything.

416
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,974
I knew everything
there was to know

417
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,022
in every book and more,

418
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,034
and... And I lost it.

419
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,961
I'm sorry...

420
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,812
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

421
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,072
My daughter's gone...

422
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,377
Forever.

423
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,486
You forgot some stuff?

424
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,913
What you lost
is still out there.

425
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,121
Go get it back.

426
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,695
Umber's ass, I am drunk.

427
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,872
Oh, Christ.

428
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,344
No. The answer's no.

429
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,818
You don't even know what I want.

430
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,377
You're a Library groupie.

431
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,613
You got a knowledge boner.

432
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,618
How'd you find out
about this place anyway?

433
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,619
It was Karen. What?

434
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,128
No, Penny told me.

435
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,688
Bad news, book tart.

436
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,200
The Library's
closed, indefinitely.

00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,496
I got bored waiting.

438
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,619
Look, I need to
speak to your boss.

439
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,941
I have something she'll want.

440
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,713
(SCOFFS) You're so mysterious.

441
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,447
It's important, asshole.

442
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,214
Fine.

443
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,416
Come on then.

444
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,533
Wait, this shouldn't work
without Wellspring magic.

445
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,650
How can you...

446
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,622
Alice Quinn.

447
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,597
Till we meet again, book tart.

448
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,034
If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

449
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,574
Roguish belligerency is a
common trait among Travelers.

450
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,543
How can he take people
with him when he travels?

451
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,569
You really do have a battery.

452
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,007
Is that why you're here?

453
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,647
No, I don't care
about the battery.

454
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,581
Well, of course I do.

455
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,579
All I want is a Library Card.

456
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,650
We're no longer
accepting new applications.

457
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,015
What do you know about Niffins?

458
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,918
I was one for a time,

459
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,895
and this is all I can remember.

460
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,555
It's half of a puzzle.

461
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,071
The other pieces
fell out of my head,

462
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,795
but they could be
inside your books.

463
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,962
You are suggesting
a trade of information?

464
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,666
More than that.

465
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,398
I wanna finish what I started,

466
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,868
<i>A Grand Unified Theory of Magic.</i>

467
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,879
But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

468
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,705
I'm afraid your
experiences as a Niffin

469
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,250
have already been
documented to our satisfaction.

470
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,977
It's in my book.

471
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,822
You don't want me
to finish. Is... Is that it?

472
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,802
There is something
you could do for us,

473
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,136
and, in exchange,
we would give you

474
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,425
full access to our collection.

475
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,032

Alice, are you working
with the Library?

00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,998
Q, you have to go.

486
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,261
Okay, great, then let's go.

a bigger problem.

This is it, right?

494
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,592
An actual answer?

than they're supposed to be

500

and humans who
are so much dumber.

501
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,311
And what you'd
call indoor plumbing,

502
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,823
we on Earth would call

503

a war crime.

00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,018

00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,689
when I was drowning,

506
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,824
Fillory saved me,

507
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,198
and now it's my
turn to save Fillory.

508
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,931

my head's in a basket,

worked, so thank you.

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,810
but it's big magic.

537
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,320
I can't do it on myself,

538
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,357
because it would just
make things worse.

539
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,791
So...

540
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,427
Here's what we'll need.

541
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,597

JULIA: <i>A fairy?</i>

543
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,994
And I can't see her,

544
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,300
because I've never
made a fairy deal?

545
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,306
This is what they do... Okay?

546
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,342
They hide behind
powerful people,

547
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,174
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

548
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,009
Wait a minute, at Irene's house,

549
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,378
Penny said that he...

550
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,349
He thought that he
saw something moving

551
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,181
that... That Q
and I couldn't see.

552
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,987
There's more of
them? (SIGHS) Oh, no.

553
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,751
No, what I'm...
What I'm saying is

554
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,452
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

555
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,159
They were doing chores.

556
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,026
Wait, what was
Irene's fairy doing?

557
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,224
Just...

558
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,864
Standing there, like
she was waiting on Irene,

559
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,028
and her head was
sort of bowed, but...

560
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,366
Bowed? Wait, that's...

561
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,202
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

562
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,639
You can't trust them.

563
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:19,203
I don't know why they'd
be acting that way, but...

564
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,906
Do you have slavery in Fillory?

565
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,576
If these fairies are
slaves, you'd be better off.

566
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,112
Fen...

567
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,911
No one is better
off with slavery.

568
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,721
Look, I have this
tiny spark of magic,

569
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,954
and it seems like when I use it

570
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:38,122
to do good things,
to help people,

571
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,495
it grows.

572
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,767
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

573
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,969
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

574
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,335
I have to use it.

575
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,265
My daughter's dead
because of them.

576
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,443
Fen, we need to know,

577
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,035
and I can't see her.

578
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,581
You need to talk
to Irene's fairy.

us safe from bad Magicians.

made on my behalf...
