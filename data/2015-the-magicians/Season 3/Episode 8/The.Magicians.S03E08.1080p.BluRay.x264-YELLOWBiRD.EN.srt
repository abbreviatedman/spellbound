1
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:02,407
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:05,715
Fray isn't yours. Your real
daughter died during childbirth.

3
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:06,825
She died?

4
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:09,044
- All right, I can help you.
- Is that cocaine?

5
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,844
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

6
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,498
- Penny, Sylvia.
- I'm babysitting now?

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,872
Sylvia is your supervisor.

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,843
If you can't bring me
back, you die too, Penny.

9
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:20,939
Benedict... do not do it!

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,191
No!

11
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,272
Mmm... yummy.

12
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:30,339
Children of Earth have been making a
mess of things here for some time.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,608
She planned this.

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,645
I'm your queen, you motherfuckers!

15
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:40,316
- What are you doing?
- Short-circuiting your panic attack.

16
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:41,958
Wait a minute, I... I... I
know these people.

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:42,971
Well, every book is here,

18
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,841
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

19
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:46,956
It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

20
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,298
So we need a gatekeeper.

21
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,852
What about the Library's dragon?

22
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,444
They call it the Bookwyrm.

23
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:54,224
I hear they use it to send books
to and from the Underworld.

24
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:56,599
Well, what if the person was a book?

25
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,469
Say I get the Key and send it back up,

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,538
it's stuck in the Satellite Library.
We need another traveler.

27
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:03,973
Okay, I work with this group now.

28
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,509
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

29
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,284
You have to go, if that's
what you wanna do.

30
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:09,612
I'm sorry we're cursed.

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,573
Damn it!

32
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,512
Hey, uh, guy...

33
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,514
Yeah, what is this?

34
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:22,916
Temp housing, and before you ask,

35
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,685
yes, the system is still down.

36
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:26,852
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

37
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:28,388
The outhouses to your left.

38
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,022
Outhouses here? No, look, I... I'm...

39
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:32,733
- I'm just looking for someone.
- Did you file a request?

40
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,963
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

41
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:40,032
This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

42
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,468
I might be able to help, unofficially,

43
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:45,071
if, uh...

44
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,606
Yeah, uh...

45
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,774
what the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

46
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:50,985
Uh... is there money here?

47
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:54,747
And what about the White Walkers?

48
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,115
Oh, the White Walkers?

49
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,783
Yeah, I mean, those guys are bad news.

50
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,514
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

51
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:00,986
came and, uh, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

52
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,555
- W... wait, who was that?
- You know!

53
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,424
You know, dope outfit.

54
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,659
Speaks in rhymes. Has eight dragons.

55
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,728
Where did he get so many dragons?

56
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:13,665
I mean... that's the question.

57
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,066
So, you know, he came in

58
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,736
and, uh, won the throne game.

59
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:19,771
Well, no one does a twist like they do.

60
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,507
Okay, what's your friend's name?

61
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,575
Hi, um, I'm looking for Benedict.

62
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,678
- Go away.
- Benedict?

63
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,412
I'm dead! Go away!

64
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,123
It's... it's Penny.

65
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:33,651
Oh, Penny, my friend!

66
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,187
Oh... okay. Um...

67
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,656
Good hug.

68
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,458
Yeah, let's call this, man.

69
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:42,305
You can't imagine how
terrible this place is.

70
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:43,927
I'm so happy to see you.

71
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:46,164
That isn't to say I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry you're dead.

72
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,532
Oh, yeah, about that:

73
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,466
No, I'm... I'm not technically, uh...

74
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,701
I came to find you.

75
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,602
- You did?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,672
- Oh!
- Okay, we're...

77
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,940
and we're hugging again.

78
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,511
When you died, were you holding a key?

79
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,251
Are you here for the key?

80
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,783
- Yeah, do you have it?
- I thought you, uh...

81
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,118
because we were friends, that, um...

82
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:11,555
Oh, um...

83
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:14,624
Yeah, look, we're not not friends.

84
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:15,852
It's just, you know,

85
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:18,127
I'm... I'm on a mission,
and... and if we are friends...

86
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:19,996
- I am your friend!
- Then give me the key...

87
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,869
uh, please?

88
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,014
- They... they took it.
- Who?

89
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,170
Well, the Library.

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,972
Of course. Fuck me.

91
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:32,008
I just snuck out of there. Damn it!

92
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,846
Well, the Library's the only part of
the Underworld that functions now.

93
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,145
It's well-protected.

94
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:39,582
I'd say just cut your losses. There's
no way you can get in there.

95
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,550
Yeah, there is.

96
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,984
I'm a Librarian.

97
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:45,754
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

98
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:47,489
Oh, well, like I said...

99
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:49,491
best let go of it.

100
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,161
Of all of magic?

101
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,997
Would you let that go?

102
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,833
Oh, well, I'll figure it out,

103
00:04:57,843 --> 00:04:59,768
find the Key,
avoid indentured servitude...

104
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:02,536
Oh, even in death, you lead an
exciting life. I'll... I'll help.

105
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,710
- No... no, that's okay.
- I insist! I can help you sneak.

106
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,174
I can...

107
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,176
Great. Yeah!

108
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,667
We'll go together.

109
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:12,013
I just... you know, I just
need to find one more person...

110
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,307
And then, uh, we'll loop back
and grab you in ten, okay?

111
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,015
- Okay, no hugging.
- Okay.

112
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,339
- All right.
- I'll be here.

113
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,064
- I'm gonna go this way.
- Okay.

114
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:36,174
- Hi, Penny.
- Sylvia?

115
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:39,547
You're about to do something stupid.

116
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:43,610
I'm sorry...

117
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,145
for leaving you behind in...

118
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:46,813
Oh, you mean in the Poison Room?

119
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,114
God, I was a goner.

120
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:49,916
- I'm not mad.
- I am.

121
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,341
Well, don't be.

122
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,053
I'm fine, well, for a dead girl.

123
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,988
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

124
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,658
between the stuck-in-the-astral thing

125
00:05:57,668 --> 00:05:59,660
and the 'bout-to-fuck-up-royally thing.

126
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,327
How do you know I'm...

127
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:04,330
Oh, the same way I knew
that you were here right now.

128
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,482
- It is written.
- What is that?

129
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,634
Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

130
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,804
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

131
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:12,057
Follow me.

132
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,694
Cassandra? I brought a friend.

133
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,471
Alice?

134
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:52,857
Cassandra, calm down. It's okay.

135
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:55,527
- It's okay.
- What the hell is going on?

136
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,530
Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

137
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,955
I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

138
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:03,683
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

139
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:06,625
I don't know what to tell you. She's
been here thousands of years.

140
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:09,619
- Make him go away.
- I can't. He needs your help.

141
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,981
Here's the deal:

142
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,050
- Cassandra has a gift.
- A curse.

143
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,853
She kinda got involved with this guy...

144
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,355
God.

145
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:25,523
And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

146
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,524
so he gave her magical sight.

147
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,060
She can see the future.

148
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,494
This should sound familiar,

149
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:32,029
if you've read any ancient myths.

150
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,530
The one that no one believed

151
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,532
and it drove her batshit crazy?

152
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,201
Quiet, squirrels.

153
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,203
I guess some Librarians found her

154
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,172
and got her to start
writing everything down.

155
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:43,374
Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

156
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:45,008
of the people in the Library?

157
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:46,243
Well, yes and no.

158
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:48,412
She can only write one at a time.

159
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,981
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

160
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,900
to, like, industrialize her thing,

161
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,485
and that's how all books were written.

162
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,086
That stopped when magic did,

163
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:58,354
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

164
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:00,390
Trying to concentrate.

165
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,692
Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

166
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,161
and I read that you were here,

167
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:05,929
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

168
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,397
and so I did, and here we are.

169
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,999
Out of 7 billion people in the world,

170
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:10,149
she's writing about me?

171
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,702
Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

172
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,404
making you maybe our only hope.

173
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:15,705
- No presh.
- So, what do we do?

174
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,407
Do we just... do we just wait for her

175
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,709
to maybe write about the lost key?

176
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:28,418
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin...

177
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,762
God, it's a sex scene.

178
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,425
I'm worried that the plan won't work.

179
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:39,257
Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

180
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,682
What plan is that?

181
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,844
The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

182
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:48,165
I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

183
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:52,106
It's incredibly dangerous, and
I don't think that we are...

184
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,410
fully... you know, equipped.

185
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,278
I assure you, Quentin,

186
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,013
I'm fully equipped.

187
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,782
I can't ask you

188
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,017
to risk your life for my quest.

189
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,157
Real talk, I'm a very self-interested
person, and I want magic back.

190
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,993
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

191
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,428
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

192
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:16,697
Maybe you have to bring me

193
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,499
or you totally fail, hmm?

194
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,601
I don't think that's how this works.

195
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,269
If it's such a bad idea,

196
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,704
then why are you going?

197
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:26,707
Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

198
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:30,511
A quest is supposed to change a quester.

199
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,613
The person who starts it

200
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:35,215
couldn't, you know, finish it.

201
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,185
So run a gauntlet to get the keys,

202
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:40,053
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

203
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,288
that can get the keys?

204
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,023
Exactly.

205
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,158
I know what I have to be

206
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,361
to win this quest:

207
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,697
a... hero.

208
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:54,534
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

209
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,202
Okay...

210
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,638
I reject your whole premise.

211
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,040
That's all people do: try to change.

212
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,410
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

213
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,844
Believe me, I tried.

214
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,213
Eventually, I realized

215
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,516
the brave thing is to be you

216
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,151
and accept the consequences.

217
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:15,554
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

218
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,665
Shit's about to get awkward, huh?

219
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:27,927
Oh, because you slept with Q?

220
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:30,502
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

221
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:33,605
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

222
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,542
- Robbing the Library?
- Oh.

223
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,510
How are you even gonna get there?

224
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,779
We have a traveler: Victoria.

225
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,338
But how's she gonna travel you?
That part's a spell.

226
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:45,492
Yeah, so, we're not doing that.

227
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:48,269
- Travelers are magical creatures...
- They're technically hybrids.

228
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,687
Fine, whatever.

229
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,789
All I know is that we can use her DNA.

230
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,862
She's gonna build a Mirror Bridge.

231
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:57,295
- All we need is, uh...
- PHD-level skill and patience

232
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:00,265
and more traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

233
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,599
Exactly.

234
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,868
Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

235
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:06,235
- from when I was a...
- Sociopathic energy monster?

236
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:07,489
Yeah.

237
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,274
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

238
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,742
a hundred miles apart, max.

239
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,878
Well, we're better than hedges.

240
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,401
Light years better?

241
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,714
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

242
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:20,135
So if you're not perfect, Victoria dies.

243
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,286
- Forget it. I'm out.
- Okay, hold on.

244
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:24,455
I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

245
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,635
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

246
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:29,407
We don't do it until we get the
math right, and I'll make sure that...

247
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:32,329
None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

248
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,630
Alice does.

249
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,132
Get her to do the math, we can talk.

250
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,522
She said, "I already talked to Alice.
She's not gonna help."

251
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,046
Look, it's simple.

252
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,750
Prove to me the Bridge
will be stable, or I'm out.

253
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:44,219
Victoria, wait...

254
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,564
Oh, shit. Fuck.

255
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,179
What do we do now?

256
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,320
What is she after?

257
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,655
- Harriet?
- What do you mean?

258
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,191
If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

259
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,700
we deserve to know why.

260
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:08,864
Okay.

261
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,333
Library's been searching for this thing

262
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:13,201
called the Alexandria Cell.

263
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,670
It's a huge battery.

264
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,305
Librarians from ancient Egypt made it,

265
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:21,176
and if they followed the plans,
it is fucking massive.

266
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:23,278
And Harriet thinks that they found it?

267
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:26,848
Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

268
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:28,850
big magic.

269
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,452
But none of it matters

270
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,505
if we can't get to the Satellite branch.

271
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,326
Niffin notes.

272
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:41,629
Pages and pages about Mirror Bridges.

273
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,998
How did... how did you
convince her to help us?

274
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:47,001
Didn't. I stole them.

275
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:49,582
I'll make copies and put them
back before she comes home

276
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,433
from wherever she went
to sulk and be a martyr.

277
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:53,908
No, this is... this is not a good idea.

278
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:56,510
Under the circumstances,
it seemed worth it.

279
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,379
See?

280
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,647
Just had to be myself.

281
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:12,560
Okay...

282
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,828
Be careful when you step through.

283
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:37,917
Okay. I have to stay
and feed the sigils,

284
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,553
so, you know, take your time.

285
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:41,887
We'll hurry.

286
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:43,789
Thank you, Victoria.

287
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:13,619
Okay, she says, "Go left down the hall."

288
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,139
Said, "You'll find the book drop chute."

289
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:18,590
"The Bookwyrm's inside." Okay.

290
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,491
Wait, have you been here before?

291
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:26,631
Well, okay... well, let's go before
Victoria bleeds out. Come on.

292
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:35,773
Penny said he'd hide it in a book.

293
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,691
Make sure to check the chute.
Might be stuck.

294
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,031
Okay, no books. Just an actual dragon.

295
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,632
Ooh.

296
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,634
Uh... God damn it, we don't have time.

297
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,705
Oh, fuck it.

298
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:11,777
- Hello?
- Key's not here.

299
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,976
What?

300
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:16,112
So, Penny failed?

301
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,477
Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I...

302
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:20,149
Well, we can't just stand here and wait.

303
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,984
No, we need the key.

304
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,854
I just realized
my part to play in this quest.

305
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:27,023
I'm here to tell you
it is time to cut bait and run.

306
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,691
- Just live another day.
- No, we can't.

307
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:31,053
- Kady and Harriet...
- They are on their own trip,

308
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,206
and call me crazy,

309
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:34,630
but I don't think any of this
is worth Victoria's life.

310
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,710
Alice, what the hell?

311
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,813
Come on, we gotta go.

312
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,561
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

313
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:07,729
Come with me.

314
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,998
No, they'll be stuck.

315
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,503
Do what you need to do.

316
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,033
This can't be right.
The key's not there.

317
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,484
Quentin's about to
bail without me.

318
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:34,764
Well, "about to": That means
that there's still a chance.

319
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,280
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

320
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,772
And what the hell is Alice is
doing in the Satellite branch?

321
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:41,528
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

322
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,754
Alice, if you're in there, please...

323
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,932
Where is the key?

324
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,435
Fuck.

325
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:57,109
Here's a bright idea:
Keep fucking reading.

326
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,609
<i>- We're better than hedges.
- Light years better?</i>

327
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,482
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

328
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:11,543
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

329
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:13,492
Then help.

330
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,522
Look, bottom line, Alice,

331
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:22,025
you told Poppy
the Mirror Bridge won't work.

332
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:24,127
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

333
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:26,234
It won't work.

334
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,964
Would you rather I didn't tell her

335
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:30,708
and just let you guys
walk off into deep space?

336
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,887
She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

337
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,351
Once.

338
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,618
I wasn't there long.

339
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:44,947
"Brochure makes it sound great.

340
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:48,717
"They collect knowledge, keep it safe...

341
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,051
but from who?"

342
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:51,553
Whom.

343
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,730
I said "whom."

344
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,719
"The Library buries information.

345
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,613
"Only the people they choose get access.

346
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:01,700
The rest of us"...

347
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:05,000
You just wanna let all that
knowledge loose for anyone to use?

348
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,502
For good or bad?

349
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:09,571
"Don't tell me there isn't
a book in the Library

350
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:11,570
"you wouldn't die to read.

351
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,108
"If you help us,

352
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:16,248
we can offer you a piece
of what we find there."

353
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:17,584
What's that?

354
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,584
The biggest battery ever created.

355
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,995
You wanna help Penny? This is how.

356
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,271
If I say yes, that means risking lives

357
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:30,308
to give you power
maybe no one should have.

358
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,761
No thank you.

359
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,473
Door was stuck.

360
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,385
Can I have one of those?

361
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,353
So, I left.

362
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:03,557
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

363
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,828
It's "ball and chain," I think you mean.

364
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:11,498
No, that doesn't sound right.

365
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,501
I think I know what you mean.

366
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,571
I lost a lot of people recently,

367
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:20,373
including kind of myself.

368
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:23,410
Mm. That makes no sense.

369
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,012
I had everything. I knew
everything there was to know

370
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:29,891
in every book and more,
and... and I lost it.

371
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm sorry...

372
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:39,959
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

373
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:42,128
My daughter's gone...

374
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,130
forever.

375
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,632
You forgot some stuff?

376
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:50,063
What you lost is still out there.

377
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,687
Go get it back.

378
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,719
Umber's ass, I am drunk.

379
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,962
Oh, Christ.

380
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:19,430
No. The answer's no.

381
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,898
You don't even know what I want.

382
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:22,634
You're a Library groupie.

383
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,632
You got a knowledge boner.

384
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:28,105
How'd you find out
about this place anyway?

385
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,740
- It was Karen.
- What?

386
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,176
N... no, Penny told me.

387
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,777
Bad news, book tart.

388
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:35,620
The Library's closed, indefinitely.

389
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,558
I got bored waiting.

390
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:46,023
Look, I need to speak to your boss.
I have something she'll want.

391
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,926
Oh. You're so mysterious.

392
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,861
It's important, asshole.

393
00:20:50,871 --> 00:20:52,571
Fine.

394
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,404
Come on then.

395
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:58,702
Wait, this shouldn't work
without Wellspring magic.

396
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,368
How can you...

397
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,810
Alice Quinn.

398
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,886
Till we meet again, book tart.

399
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:13,049
If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

400
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,536
Roguish belligerency is
a common trait among travelers.

401
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:18,180
How can he take people
with him when he travels?

402
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:20,690
You really do have a battery.

403
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,125
Is that why you're here?

404
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:23,793
No, I don't care about the battery.

405
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,961
Well... of course I do.

406
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:27,730
All I want is a Library Card.

407
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,200
We're no longer accepting
new applications.

408
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,135
What do you know about niffins?

409
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:35,003
I was one for a time,

410
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:38,641
and this is all I can remember.
It's half of a puzzle.

411
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,142
The other pieces fell out of my head,

412
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,878
but... they could be inside your books.

413
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:45,480
You are suggesting
a trade of information?

414
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,749
More than that.

415
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,650
I wanna finish what I started:

416
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,919
a Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

417
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:53,989
But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

418
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,758
I'm afraid your experiences as a niffin

419
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:58,100
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

420
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:02,337
It's in my book.

421
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:05,166
You don't want me to finish.
Is... is that it?

422
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:06,834
There is something you could do for us,

423
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:10,654
and, in exchange, we would give you
full access to our collection.

424
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:15,109
You're familiar with
the Quest for the Seven Keys?

425
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:22,750
Excuse me a moment.

426
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,623
Alice, what the hell?

427
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,726
Come on, we gotta go.

428
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:39,092
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

429
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,295
How do you just keep appearing?

430
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,219
What were you...

431
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,987
Alice, are you working with the Library?

432
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:48,053
Q, you have to go.

433
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,264
Okay, great, then let's go.

434
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:53,905
Alice, come on.

435
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:56,192
Q, please...

436
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:07,558
The bookish girl joins the Library.
Didn't see that coming.

437
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:09,597
Yeah, little bit of a bigger problem.

438
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:12,331
Quentin left without the key!

439
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,933
This is it, right?

440
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:18,449
An actual... answer?

441
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:23,562
<i>Yes, I do want to make
a final statement.</i>

442
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:25,038
I...

443
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:28,130
hate... Fillory.

444
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,834
It is a backwards,

445
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:32,135
malodorous shithole

446
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:35,305
full of animals who are smarter
than they're supposed to be

447
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:39,116
and humans who are so much dumber.

448
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,645
And what you'd call indoor plumbing,

449
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,044
we on Earth would call

450
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:46,838
a war crime.

451
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:48,459
But...

452
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:51,487
when I was drowning,

453
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,920
Fillory saved me,

454
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,290
and now it's my turn to save Fillory.

455
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,295
But I can't do that
if my head's in a basket,

456
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:02,464
so if it pleases the...

457
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,202
You guys...

458
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,404
I demand that this
trial/peasant uprising

459
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,207
be dismissed...

460
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,877
Your honorable wombat-ness.

461
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,247
What the shit is this?

462
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,123
Why is he talking to a marsupial?

463
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:23,503
- This is not at all relevant!
- Would you just chill?

464
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:26,496
- You're gonna piss her off again.
- Next!

465
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,172
How's Alice?

466
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:48,909
Uh, well, she's not my
favorite person at the moment,

467
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,774
but, um, the transfer worked,
so thank you.

468
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:52,246
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear it.

469
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:54,715
- Yeah.
- Uh... so you're...

470
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,084
Yeah, back to powered up.

471
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,552
Good...

472
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,921
because I've, uh, come here

473
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:03,531
to collect on that favor
that you owe me.

474
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:07,964
Oh, my God.

475
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,299
Yeah.

476
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:12,423
Side-effect from
the powder that I gave you.

477
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:14,100
- Um...
- Oh, don't worry.

478
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:15,847
No, you haven't used nearly enough.

479
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,137
No, you're safe.

480
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:21,107
Look, there is a treatment,
but it's big magic.

481
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,609
I... I can't do it on myself,

482
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:25,326
because it would just make things worse.

483
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:26,699
So...

484
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,750
Here's what we'll need.

485
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,245
My office, 3:00 p.m.

486
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:35,621
A fairy?

487
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:39,591
And I can't see her, because
I've never made a fairy deal?

488
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,593
- This is what they do...
- Okay?

489
00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:43,629
They hide behind powerful people,

490
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,465
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

491
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:48,301
Wait a minute, at Irene's house,

492
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:49,668
Penny said that he...

493
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,637
he thought that he saw something moving

494
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,472
that... that Q and I couldn't see.

495
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,058
There's more of them? Oh, no.

496
00:25:56,069 --> 00:25:58,009
No, what I'm... what I'm saying is

497
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,747
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

498
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:03,482
They were doing chores.

499
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:06,065
- Wait, what was Irene's fairy doing?
- Just...

500
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:09,154
standing there,
like she was waiting on Irene,

501
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:11,323
and her head was sort of bowed, but...

502
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,438
Bowed? Wait, that's...

503
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,226
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

504
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:15,615
You can't trust them.

505
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:19,381
I don't know why they'd be
acting that way, but...

506
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:21,303
Do you have slavery in Fillory?

507
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:25,135
If these fairies are slaves,
you'd be better off.

508
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,604
Fen...

509
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:29,900
no one is better off with slavery.

510
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:32,938
Look, I have this tiny spark of magic,

511
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:35,212
and it seems like when I use it

512
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,382
to do good things, to help people,

513
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:40,050
it... it grows.

514
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,287
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

515
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,034
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

516
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:46,418
I have to use it.

517
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:49,559
My daughter's dead because of them.

518
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,496
Fen, we need to know,

519
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:53,099
and I can't see her.

520
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,844
You need to talk to Irene's fairy.

521
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:15,718
Hey. What's your name?

522
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:17,387
Yes...

523
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:19,722
I can see you.

524
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:22,384
I'm... I'm not supposed to talk to you.

525
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:23,993
Why not?

526
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,503
You must answer me.

527
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:33,150
Irene will be very angry if you don't.

528
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:35,105
Of course. Of course.

529
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:36,734
Um... I'm sorry.

530
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:39,407
- Oh, shit, you are her slave.
- No.

531
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:42,136
Okay, Miss McAllistair keeps us
safe from bad Magicians.

532
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:44,005
She hides us.

533
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:45,683
In exchange for what?

534
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:49,784
How is it you can see me?

535
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,386
I made a deal.

536
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:54,622
Well, a deal was made on my behalf...

537
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,425
with a fairy.

538
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:59,570
But... there are no other fairies.

539
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:04,782
Oh, I'm late. Miss will be waiting.

540
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:12,938
Uh... can we...

541
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,475
talk again tomorrow?

542
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,819
Miss Irene won't be home.

543
00:28:18,903 --> 00:28:20,881
My name is Skye.

544
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:29,890
No sign of fairies.

545
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,219
Then let's look in here first.

546
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,933
If, uh, we don't find Skye, we'll
have to break into the main house,

547
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:35,955
hope that Irene doesn't come home.

548
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:47,608
Fen, what is it? What do you see?

549
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:49,776
It's her. It's Skye. She's...

550
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:51,812
oh, God, they cut off her leg.

551
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,920
Hey...

552
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,119
It's what the powder's made of.

553
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:12,864
What happened to you?

554
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,441
Who did this?

555
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,846
Irene did.

556
00:38:58,314 --> 00:38:59,892
They left.

557
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:02,554
The Mirror Bridge is gone.

558
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,083
Alice...

559
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:08,887
just talk to me. Come on.

560
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:10,388
I'm not Alice.

561
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,029
God damn it!

562
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:39,853
What is it?

563
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:43,220
Quentin and Poppy: sex scene.

564
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:45,256
That you kinda skimmed, prude.

565
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:48,059
Um, not that I'm complaining, but, um...

566
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,394
- Why am I doing this?
- What?

567
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:51,896
'Cause I can only go so long

568
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,232
feeling completely alone and worthless,

569
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,076
before I break down
and do something stupid.

570
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:03,106
Right. You're an idiot.

571
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:05,751
- Quentin?
- No, me!

572
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,313
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

573
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,401
You didn't want me
to bail on you, so you lied,

574
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:14,117
and then I bailed on you anyway.

575
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,928
Be mad. Don't be stupid.

576
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,757
I buried it. Sorry.

577
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:23,079
I spent so much of my life alone,

578
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,190
the thought of spending
the rest of time...

579
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:28,723
I thought you were my friend,

580
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,426
and I thought...

581
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:33,468
if you couldn't find
the key, eventually you'd...

582
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:35,171
I don't know...

583
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:37,139
What, decide to hang out
in your dumb tent?

584
00:40:37,149 --> 00:40:39,509
I thought we'd spruce it up together.

585
00:40:44,123 --> 00:40:45,815
Look...

586
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:49,118
don't ask me how I know this, but...

587
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:53,490
you are the only person
who cried when I died.

588
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:56,558
We are friends, and I appreciate you,

589
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,699
so, listen...

590
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,464
once you show me where the
key is buried, Sylvia...

591
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:05,002
is gonna take you
to the Library map room.

592
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:08,469
You are going to be very popular.

593
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:23,218
Well, um, I guess this is it.

594
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:26,988
Well, until the next time I die, anyway.

595
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,157
And I want the record to show
that I helped you get that key,

596
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,259
making this the second time
I saved your ass.

597
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,161
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,063
Wait... whoa, hey, whoa!

599
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:37,332
I need to... still need to get in there.

600
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,569
Sylvia?

601
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,337
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

602
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:47,274
Alice, what the hell?

603
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:52,815
Alice, are you working with the Library?

604
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:55,048
Q, please...

605
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,028
- Hey.
- Hey.

606
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:11,964
What was that?

607
00:42:11,974 --> 00:42:14,272
It sounded like a dragon barfing.

608
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,195
We gotta get back to
the book chute. Come on.

609
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:22,870
Holy shit!

610
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:25,544
Did you... okay.

611
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:27,379
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

612
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,416
Oh, but Penny...

613
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:32,418
No, we don't have time. I'm sorry.

614
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:34,886
Shit.
