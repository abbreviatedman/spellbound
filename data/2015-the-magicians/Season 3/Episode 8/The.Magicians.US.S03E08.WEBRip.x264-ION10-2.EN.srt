1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:06,507
.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,441
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,278
- Fray isn't yours.

4
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,279
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

5
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,813
- She died?

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,448
- All right, I can help you.
- Is that cocaine?

7
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,085
- It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,319
- [sniffs]

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,288
- Penny, Sylvia.
- I'm babysitting now?

10
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,123
- Sylvia is your supervisor.

11
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,524
- If you can't bring me back,
you die too, Penny.

12
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,493
- Benedict...do not do it!

13
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,562
No!

14
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,165
- Mmm...yummy.

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,434
- Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

16
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,136
for some time.

17
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,337
- She planned this.

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,374
- I'm your queen,
you motherfuckers!

19
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,576
[tense music]

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,212
- What are you doing?

21
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,446
- Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

22
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,514
- Wait a minute,
I--I--I know these people.

23
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,316
- Well, every book is here,

24
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,151
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

25
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,619
- It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

26
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,321
- So we need a gatekeeper.

27
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,455
- What about
the Library's dragon?

28
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,290
They call it the Bookwyrm.

29
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:57,525
I hear they use it

30
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,193
to send books
to and from the Underworld.

31
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,329
- Well, what if the person
was a book?

32
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,232
- Say I get the Key
and send it back up,

33
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,533
it's stuck in
the Satellite Library.

34
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,301
- We need another traveler.

35
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,636
- Okay, I work with
this group now.

36
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,272
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

37
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,640
- You have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

38
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,342
- I'm sorry we're cursed.

39
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,444
*

40
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,513
[pencil scratching]

41
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,224
[elevator rattles, drones]

42
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,329
- [grunts]
Damn it!

43
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,505
[solemn music]

44
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:51,545
*

45
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,231
[indistinct chatter]

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,278
Hey, uh, guy...

47
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah, what is this?

48
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,615
- Temp housing,
and before you ask,

49
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,417
yes, the system is still down.

50
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,552
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

51
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,187
The outhouses to your left.

52
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,688
- Outhouses here?
No, look, I--I'm--

53
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,491
I'm just looking for someone.
- Did you file a request?

54
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,662
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

55
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,698
- This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

56
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,268
- I might be able to help,
unofficially,

57
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,737
if, uh...

58
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,372
- Yeah, uh...

59
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,507
what the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

60
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,676
Uh...is there money here?

61
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,480
- And what about
the White Walkers?

62
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,781
- Oh, the White Walkers?

63
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,516
Yeah, I mean,
those guys are bad news.

64
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,318
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

65
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,686
came and, uh, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

66
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,322
- W--wait, who was that?
- You know!

67
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,224
You know, dope outfit.

68
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,426
Speaks in rhymes.
Has eight dragons.

69
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,462
- Where did he get
so many dragons?

70
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:18,432
- I mean...that's the question.

71
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,733
So, you know, he came in

72
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,470
and, uh, won the throne game.

73
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,505
- Well, no one does
a twist like they do.

74
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,639
- [chuckles]

75
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,308
- Okay, what's
your friend's name?

76
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,343
- Hi, um,
I'm looking for Benedict.

77
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,445
- Go away.
- Benedict?

78
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,013
- I'm dead! Go away!

79
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,815
- It's--it's Penny.

80
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,419
- Oh, Penny, my friend!

81
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,854
- Oh...okay. Um...

82
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,424
Good hug.

83
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,259
Yeah, let's call this, man.

84
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,860
- You can't imagine
how terrible this place is.

85
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,629
I'm so happy to see you.

86
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,831
That isn't to say I'm--I'm--
I'm sorry you're dead.

87
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,333
- Oh, yeah, about that:

88
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,268
No, I'm--I'm not
technically, uh--

89
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,469
I came to find you.

90
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,371
- You did?
- Yeah.

91
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,440
- Oh!
- Okay, we're--

92
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,642
and we're hugging again.
- [giggles]

93
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,413
- When you died,
were you holding a key?

94
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,515
- [inhales sharply]

95
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,517
Are you here for the key?

96
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,519
- Yeah, do you have it?
- I thought you, uh--

97
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,787
because we were friends,
that, um...

98
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,357
- Oh, um...

99
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,393
Yeah, look, we're not
not friends.

100
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,728
It's just, you know,

101
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,796
I'm--I'm on a mission,
and--and if we are friends--

102
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,698
- I am your friend!
- Then give me the key...

103
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,334
uh, please? [chuckles]

104
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,469
- They--they took it.
- Who?

105
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,839
- Well, the Library.

106
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,675
- Of course.
[laughs] Fuck me.

107
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,810
I just snuck out of there.
Damn it!

108
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,446
- Well, the Library's
the only part of the Underworld

109
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,447
that functions now.

110
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,814
It's well-protected.

111
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,550
I'd say just cut your losses.

112
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,385
There's no way you can
get in there. [laughs]

113
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,354
- Yeah, there is.

114
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,688
I'm a Librarian.

115
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,524
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

116
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,092
- Oh, well, like I said...

117
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,094
best let go of it.

118
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,095
[sighs, chuckles]

119
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,831
- Of all of magic?

120
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,701
Would you let that go?

121
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,570
Oh, well, I'll figure it out,

122
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,538
find the Key,
avoid indentured servitude--

123
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,440
- Oh, even in death,
you lead an exciting life.

124
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,708
I'll--I'll help
- No--no, that's okay.

125
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,343
- No, I insist!
I can help you sneak.

126
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,111
I can--

127
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,846
- Great. Yeah!

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,648
We'll go together.

129
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,350
I just--you know, I just
need to find one more person...

130
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,851
- Okay?

131
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,553
- And then, uh, we'll loop back
and grab you in ten, okay?

132
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:20,721
Okay, no hugging.
- [chuckling] Okay.

133
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,955
- All right.
- I'll be here.

134
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,825
- I'm gonna go this way.
- Okay.

135
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:31,899
*

136
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,642
- Hi, Penny.
- Sylvia?

137
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,378
- You're about to do
something stupid.

138
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,416
- I'm sorry...

139
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,850
for leaving you behind in--

140
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,585
- Oh, you mean
in the Poison Room?

141
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:52,820
God, I was a goner.

142
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,655
I'm not mad.
- I am.

143
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,390
- Well, don't be.

144
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,759
I'm fine, well,
for a dead girl.

145
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,594
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

146
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,463
between the
stuck-in-the-astral thing

147
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,465
and the 'bout-to-
fuck-up-royally thing.

148
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,999
- How do you know I'm...

149
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,002
- Oh, the same way I knew
that you were here right now.

150
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,439
It is written.
- What is that?

151
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,441
- Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

152
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,576
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

153
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,445
Follow me.

154
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,448
[slow, mysterious music]

155
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:27,521
*

156
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,501
Cassandra?
I brought a friend.

157
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:44,672
*

158
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,907
- Alice?

159
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,045
.

160
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,379
- [shrieks]

161
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,850
- Cassandra, calm down.
It's okay.

162
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,587
It's okay.
- What the hell is going on?

163
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,590
- Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

164
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,026
- I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

165
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,561
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

166
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,096
- I don't know
what to tell you.

167
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,031
She's been here, like,
thousands of years.

168
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,034
- [whispers] Make him go away.
- I can't. He needs your help.

169
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,969
- [whimpers softly]

170
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,941
- Here's the deal:

171
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,010
Cassandra has a gift.
- A curse.

172
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,846
- She kinda got involved
with this guy...

173
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,247
- God.

174
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,583
- And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

175
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,585
so he gave her magical sight.

176
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,020
She can see the future.

177
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,555
This should sound familiar,

178
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,989
if you've read
any ancient myths.

179
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,591
- The one that no one believed

180
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,593
and it drove her batshit crazy?

181
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,128
- Quiet, squirrels.

182
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,130
- I guess some Librarians
found her

183
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,098
and got her to start
writing everything down.

184
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,267
- Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

185
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,969
of the people in the Library?

186
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,170
- Well, yes and no.

187
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,506
She can only write
one at a time.

188
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,942
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

189
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,010
to, like,
industrialize her thing,

190
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,546
and that's how
all books were written.

191
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,047
That stopped when magic did,

192
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,249
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

- Trying to concentrate.

194
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,720
- Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

195
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,088
and I read that you were here,

196
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,923
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

197
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,291
and so I did,
and here we are.

00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,730
- Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

201
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,298
making you maybe our only hope.

202
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,733
No presh.
- So, what do we do?

203
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,301
Do we just--
do we just wait for her

204
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,737
to maybe write about
the lost key?

- Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

212
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,627
- What plan is that?

213
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,929
- The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

214
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,199
- I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

215
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,333
It's incredibly dangerous,

216
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,036

that we are...

217
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,272
fully...you know, equipped.

218
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,174
- I assure you, Quentin,

219
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,976
I'm fully equipped.

220
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,778

for my quest.

Real talk, I'm a very
self-interested person,

and I want magic back.

225
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,956
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

226
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,291
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

227
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,728
Maybe you have to bring me

228
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,362
or you totally fail, hmm?

229
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,632

that's how this works.

230

If it's such a bad idea,

231
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,735
then why are you going?

232
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,738
- Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

233
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,374
A quest is supposed
to change a quester.

236
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,115
- So run a gauntlet
to get the keys,

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,017

makes you the guy

238

00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,987

243
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,398

the brave thing is to be you

251

Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

258
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,671
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

259
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,407
Robbing the Library?
- Oh.

260
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,375
- How are you even
gonna get there?

261
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,812
- We have a traveler:
Victoria.

262
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,079
- But how's she
gonna travel you?

263
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,314
That part's a spell.

264
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,382
- Yeah, so,
we're not doing that.

265
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,118
Travelers are
magical creatures--

266
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,721
- They're technically hybrids.
- Fine, whatever.

267

All I know is that
we can use her DNA.

She's gonna build
a Mirror Bridge.

00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,192
All we need is, uh--

270
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,228
- PHD-level skill and patience

271

she has in her entire body.

272
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,465
- Exactly.

273
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,868
- Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

274
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,237
from when I was a--
- Sociopathic energy monster?

275
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,905
- Yeah.

276
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,207
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

277
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,776
a hundred miles apart, max.

278
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,878
- Well, we're better
than hedges.

279
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,813
- Light years better?

280
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,749
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

281
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,217
So if you're not perfect,
Victoria dies.

Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

until we get the math right,

286
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,827

287

how the Bridge works.

Alice does.

Get her to do the math,
we can talk.

that they found it?

309

doing magic on Earth,

Just an actual dragon.

- Ooh.

362
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,541

Hello?
- Key's not here.

367
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,018
- What? [sighs]

368
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,120
So, Penny failed?

369
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,589
- Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I--

370
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,157
- Well, we can't just
stand here and wait.

371
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,026
- No, we need the key.

372
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,728
- I just realized
my part to play in this quest.

373
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,064
I'm here to tell you
it is time to cut bait and run.

374
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,599
Just live another day.
- No, we can't.

is worth Victoria's life.

The key's not there.

Quentin's about to bail
without me.

396

- Well, "about to": That means
that there's still a chance.

397
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,533
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

the hell is Alice is doing

in the Satellite branch?

400
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,205
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

Alice, if you're in there,
please...

402
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,510
Where is the key?

403
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,114
Fuck.

404
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,653
- Here's a bright idea:
Keep fucking reading.

405
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,262
- We're better than hedges.
- Light years better?

406

You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

407
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,335
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

408
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,170
- Then help.

409
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,176
- Look, bottom line, Alice,

410
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,578
you told Poppy
the Mirror Bridge won't work.

411
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,680
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

412
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,117
- It won't work.

413
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,551
Would you rather
I didn't tell her

414
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,354
and just let you guys
walk off into deep space?

415
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,493
- She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

416
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,863
- Once.

417
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,566

- Whom.

422
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,377
- I said "whom."

00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,448

information.

get access.

all that knowledge loose

00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,191

ever created.

You wanna help Penny?
This is how.

436
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,178

that means risking lives

Can I have one of those?

00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,177
So, I left.

00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:07,347

sound right.

what you mean.

- I'm sorry...

459
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:43,683
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

My daughter's gone...

Go get it back.

Umber's ass, I am drunk.

- Oh, Christ.

467
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,256
No. The answer's no.

468
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,624
- You don't even know
what I want.

469
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,426
- You're a Library groupie.

You got a knowledge boner.

about this place anyway?

It was Karen.

The Library's closed,
indefinitely.

Look, I need to
speak to your boss.

Come on then.

- If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

489
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,446
- Roguish belligerency is
a common trait among travelers.

490
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,682
- How can he take people
with him when he travels?

491
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,484
You really do have a battery.

492
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,818
- Is that why you're here?

493
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,554
- No, I don't care
about the battery.

494
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,689
Well...of course I do.

495
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,524
All I want is a Library Card.

496
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,894
- We're no longer accepting
new applications.

497
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,829
- What do you know
about niffins?

498
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,731
I was one for a time,

499
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,700
and this is all I can remember.

500
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,435
It's half of a puzzle.

501
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,836
The other pieces
fell out of my head,

502
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,639
but...they could be
inside your books.

503
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,108
- You are suggesting
a trade of information?

504
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,543
- More than that.

505
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,445
I wanna finish what I started:

506
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,681
a Grand Unified
Theory of Magic.

507
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,717
- But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,552
I'm afraid your experiences
as a niffin

509
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,821
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

510
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,459
- [softly] It's in my book.

511
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,861
You don't want me to finish.
Is--is that it?

512
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,597
- There is something
you could do for us,

513
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,864
and, in exchange,
we would give you

514
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:15,468
full access to our collection.

515
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,838

How do you just keep appearing?

What were you--

00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,437
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

529
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,838
- Q, you have to go.

530
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,006

joins the Library.

535

Didn't see that coming.

536
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,526
- Yeah, little bit
of a bigger problem.

537
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,563
Quentin left without the key!

538
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,031
This is it, right?

539
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,435
An actual...answer?

540
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,473
- Yes, I do want to make
a final statement.

541
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,541
I...

542
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,043
hate...Fillory.

543
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,879
It is a backwards,

544
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,047
malodorous shithole

545
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,184
full of animals who are smarter
than they're supposed to be

546
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:42,622
and humans who are
so much dumber.

547
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,658
And what you'd call
indoor plumbing,

548
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,060
we on Earth would call

549
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,162
a war crime.

550
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,231
But...

551
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,967
when I was drowning,

552
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,069
Fillory saved me,

553
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,572
and now it's my turn
to save Fillory.

554
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,174
But I can't do that
if my head's in a basket,

555
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,512
so if it pleases the--

trial/peasant uprising

559

Your honorable wombat-ness.

562
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,161
- What the shit is this?

563
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,263
Why is he talking
to a marsupial?

564
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,499
This is not at all relevant!
- Would you just chill?

565
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,667
You're gonna
piss her off again.

566
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,569
- Next!

570

- Uh, well, she's not my
favorite person at the moment,

571
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,960
but, um, the transfer worked,
so thank you.

572
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,161
- Oh, well,
I'm glad to hear it.

573
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,730
- Yeah.
- Uh...so you're...

574
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,032
- Yeah, back to powered up.

575
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,601
- Good...

576
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,903
because I've, uh, come here

577
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,606
to collect on that favor
that you owe me.

578
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,143
- Oh, my God.

579
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,012
- Yeah.

580
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,314
Side-effect from
the powder that I gave you.

581
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,049
- Um...
- Oh, don't worry.

582
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,018
No, you haven't used
nearly enough.

583
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,086
No, you're safe.

584
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,554
Look, there is a treatment,

585
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:24,056
but it's big magic.

586
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,658
I--I can't do it on myself,

587
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,661
because it would just
make things worse.

588
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,731
So...

589
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,766
Here's what we'll need.

590
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,703
My office, 3:00 p.m.

591
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,671
- A fairy?

592
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,206
And I can't see her,

593
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,642
because I've never
made a fairy deal?

594
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,644
- This is what they do...
- Okay?

595
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,679
- They hide behind
powerful people,

596
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,348
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

597
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,217
- Wait a minute,
at Irene's house,

598
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,719
Penny said that he--

599
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,687
he thought that he saw
something moving

600
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,355
that--that Q and I
couldn't see.

601
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,191
- There's more of them?
Oh, no.

602
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,993
- No, what I'm--
what I'm saying is

603
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:04,764
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

604
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,365
They were doing chores.

605
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,234
Wait, what was
Irene's fairy doing?

606
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,169
- Just...

607
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,104
standing there,
like she was waiting on Irene,

608
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,240
and her head was
sort of bowed, but--

609
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,708
- Bowed? Wait, that's--

610
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,376
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

611
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,245
- You can't trust them.

612
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,381
I don't know why they'd be
acting that way, but--

613
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,717
- Do you have slavery
in Fillory?

614
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,087
- If these fairies are slaves,
you'd be better off.

615
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,656
- Fen...

616
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:33,092
no one is better off
with slavery.

617
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,128
Look, I have this
tiny spark of magic,

618
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,164
and it seems like when I use it

619
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:41,300
to do good things,
to help people,

620
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,035
it--it grows.

621
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:46,205
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

622
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,174
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

623
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,342
I have to use it.

624
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,645
- My daughter's dead
because of them.

625
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,781
- Fen, we need to know,

626
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,248
and I can't see her.

627
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,051

to Irene's fairy.

Yes...

I can see you.

636
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,377

supposed to talk to you.

00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,079
- Why not?

Irene will be very angry
if you don't.

641
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,190
- Of course. Of course.

642
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,059
Um...I'm sorry.

643

- No.

Okay, Miss McAllistair keeps us
safe from bad Magicians.

She hides us.

- In exchange for what?

647
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,839
- How is it you can see me?

648
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,306
- I made a deal.

649
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,710
Well, a deal was made
on my behalf...

650
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,345

651

in here first.

If, uh, we don't find Skye,

714
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,572
- I thought we'd
spruce it up together.

715
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,974
- [sighs]

716
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,812
Look...

717
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:50,048
don't ask me
how I know this, but...

718
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:54,620
you are the only person
who cried when I died.

719
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,623
We are friends,
and I appreciate you,

720
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,991
so, listen...

721
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,960
once you show me
where the key is buried,

722
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,529
Sylvia...

723
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:06,064
is gonna take you
to the Library map room.

724
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,535
You are going to be
very popular.

725
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:14,640
*

726
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:24,149
Well, um, I guess this is it.

727
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,851
- [chuckles]

728
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,953
- Well, until the next time
I die, anyway.

729
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,088
- And I want the record to show
that I helped you get that key,

730
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,190
making this the second time
I saved your ass.

731
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,092
- [laughs] Oh, my gosh.

732
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,027
Wait--whoa, hey, whoa!

733
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,229
I need to--
still need to get in there.

734
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,298
[ominous music]

735
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,634
Sylvia?

736
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,235
What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

737
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,972
[tense music]

738
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,206
- Alice, what the hell?

739
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,010
*

740
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,012
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

741
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,014
- Q, please...

742
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,116
- [sighs]

743
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:05,156
*

744
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:09,995
- Hey.
- Hey.

745
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,262
[dragon growls]

746
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:12,964
- What was that?

747
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,266
- It sounded like
a dragon barfing.

748
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,702
We gotta get back to
the book chute. Come on.

749
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,069
- Sh--

750
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,270
*

751
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:20,338
[dragon hisses, grumbles]

752
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,140
[gasping]

753
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,676
- Holy shit!

754
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,612
- Did you--okay.

755
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,279
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

756
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,048
*

757
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,316
Oh, but Penny...

758
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,318
- No, we don't have time.
I'm sorry.

759
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,887
[grunts]
- Shit.

760
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:42,961
