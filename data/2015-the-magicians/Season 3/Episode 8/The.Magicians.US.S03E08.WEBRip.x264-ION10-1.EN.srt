1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,441
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,278
- Fray isn't yours.

3
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,279
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,813
- She died?

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,448
- All right, I can help you.
- Is that cocaine?

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,085
- It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,288
- Penny, Sylvia.
- I'm babysitting now?

8
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,123
- Sylvia is your supervisor.

9
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,524
- If you can't bring me back,
you die too, Penny.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,493
- Benedict...do not do it!

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,562
No!

12
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,165
- Mmm...yummy.

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,434
- Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

14
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,136
for some time.

15
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,337
- She planned this.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,374
- I'm your queen,
you motherfuckers!

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,212
- What are you doing?

18
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,446
- Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,514
- Wait a minute,
I--I--I know these people.

20
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,316
- Well, every book is here,

21
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,151
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

22
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,619
- It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

23
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,321
- So we need a gatekeeper.

24
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,455
- What about
the Library's dragon?

25
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,290
They call it the Bookwyrm.

26
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:57,525
I hear they use it

27
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,193
to send books
to and from the Underworld.

28
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,329
- Well, what if the person
was a book?

29
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,232
- Say I get the Key
and send it back up,

30
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,533
it's stuck in
the Satellite Library.

31
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,301
- We need another traveler.

32
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,636
- Okay, I work with
this group now.

33
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,272
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

34
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,640
- You have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

35
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,342
- I'm sorry we're cursed.

36
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,444
*

37
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,329
Damn it!

38
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:51,545
*

39
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,278
Hey, uh, guy...

40
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah, what is this?

41
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,615
- Temp housing,
and before you ask,

42
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,417
yes, the system is still down.

43
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,552
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

44
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,187
The outhouses to your left.

45
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,688
- Outhouses here?
No, look, I--I'm--

46
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,491
I'm just looking for someone.
- Did you file a request?

47
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,662
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

48
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,698
- This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

49
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,268
- I might be able to help,
unofficially,

50
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,737
if, uh...

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,372
- Yeah, uh...

52
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,507
what the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

53
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,676
Uh...is there money here?

54
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,480
- And what about
the White Walkers?

55
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,781
- Oh, the White Walkers?

56
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,516
Yeah, I mean,
those guys are bad news.

57
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,318
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

58
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,686
came and, uh, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

59
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,322
- W--wait, who was that?
- You know!

60
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,224
You know, dope outfit.

61
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,426
Speaks in rhymes.
Has eight dragons.

62
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,462
- Where did he get
so many dragons?

63
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:18,432
- I mean...that's the question.

64
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,733
So, you know, he came in

65
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,470
and, uh, won the throne game.

66
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,505
- Well, no one does
a twist like they do.

67
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,308
- Okay, what's
your friend's name?

68
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,343
- Hi, um,
I'm looking for Benedict.

69
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,445
- Go away.
- Benedict?

70
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,013
- I'm dead! Go away!

71
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,815
- It's--it's Penny.

72
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,419
- Oh, Penny, my friend!

73
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,854
- Oh...okay. Um...

74
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,424
Good hug.

75
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,259
Yeah, let's call this, man.

76
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,860
- You can't imagine
how terrible this place is.

77
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,629
I'm so happy to see you.

78
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,831
That isn't to say I'm--I'm--
I'm sorry you're dead.

79
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,333
- Oh, yeah, about that:

80
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,268
No, I'm--I'm not
technically, uh--

81
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,469
I came to find you.

82
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,371
- You did?
- Yeah.

83
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,440
- Oh!
- Okay, we're--

84
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,642
and we're hugging again.

85
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,413
- When you died,
were you holding a key?

86
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,517
Are you here for the key?

87
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,519
- Yeah, do you have it?
- I thought you, uh--

88
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,787
because we were friends,
that, um...

89
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,357
- Oh, um...

90
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,393
Yeah, look, we're not
not friends.

91
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,728
It's just, you know,

92
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,796
I'm--I'm on a mission,
and--and if we are friends--

93
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,698
- I am your friend!
- Then give me the key...

94
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,334
uh, please?

95
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,469
- They--they took it.
- Who?

96
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,839
- Well, the Library.

97
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,675
- Of course.
Fuck me.

98
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,810
I just snuck out of there.
Damn it!

99
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,446
- Well, the Library's
the only part of the Underworld

100
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,447
that functions now.

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,814
It's well-protected.

102
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,550
I'd say just cut your losses.

103
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,385
There's no way you can
get in there.

104
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,354
- Yeah, there is.

105
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,688
I'm a Librarian.

106
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,524
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

107
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,092
- Oh, well, like I said...

108
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,094
best let go of it.

109
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,831
- Of all of magic?

110
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,701
Would you let that go?

111
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,570
Oh, well, I'll figure it out,

112
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,538
find the Key,
avoid indentured servitude--

113
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,440
- Oh, even in death,
you lead an exciting life.

114
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,708
I'll--I'll help
- No--no, that's okay.

115
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,343
- No, I insist!
I can help you sneak.

116
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,111
I can--

117
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,846
- Great. Yeah!

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,648
We'll go together.

119
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,350
I just--you know, I just
need to find one more person...

120
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,851
- Okay?

121
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,553
- And then, uh, we'll loop back
and grab you in ten, okay?

122
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:20,721
Okay, no hugging.
- Okay.

123
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,955
- All right.
- I'll be here.

124
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,825
- I'm gonna go this way.
- Okay.

125
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:31,899
*

126
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,642
- Hi, Penny.
- Sylvia?

127
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,378
- You're about to do
something stupid.

128
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,416
- I'm sorry...

129
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,850
for leaving you behind in--

130
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,585
- Oh, you mean
in the Poison Room?

131
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:52,820
God, I was a goner.

132
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,655
I'm not mad.
- I am.

133
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,390
- Well, don't be.

134
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,759
I'm fine, well,
for a dead girl.

135
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,594
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

136
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,463
between the
stuck-in-the-astral thing

137
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,465
and the 'bout-to-
fuck-up-royally thing.

138
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,999
- How do you know I'm...

139
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,002
- Oh, the same way I knew
that you were here right now.

140
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,439
It is written.
- What is that?

141
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,441
- Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

142
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,576
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

143
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,445
Follow me.

144
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:27,521
*

145
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,501
Cassandra?
I brought a friend.

146
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:44,672
*

147
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,907
- Alice?

148
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,850
- Cassandra, calm down.
It's okay.

149
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,587
It's okay.
- What the hell is going on?

150
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,590
- Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

151
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,026
- I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

152
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,561
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

153
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,096
- I don't know
what to tell you.

154
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,031
She's been here, like,
thousands of years.

155
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,034
- Make him go away.
- I can't. He needs your help.

156
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,941
- Here's the deal:

157
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,010
Cassandra has a gift.
- A curse.

158
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,846
- She kinda got involved
with this guy...

159
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,247
- God.

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,583
- And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

161
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,585
so he gave her magical sight.

162
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,020
She can see the future.

163
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,555
This should sound familiar,

164
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,989
if you've read
any ancient myths.

165
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,591
- The one that no one believed

166
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,593
and it drove her batshit crazy?

167
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,128
- Quiet, squirrels.

168
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,130
- I guess some Librarians
found her

169
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,098
and got her to start
writing everything down.

170
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,267
- Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

171
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,969
of the people in the Library?

172
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,170
- Well, yes and no.

173
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,506
She can only write
one at a time.

174
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,942
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

175
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,010
to, like,
industrialize her thing,

176
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,546
and that's how
all books were written.

177
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,047
That stopped when magic did,

178
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,249
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

179
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,284
- Trying to concentrate.

180
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,720
- Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

181
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,088
and I read that you were here,

182
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,923
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

183
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,291
and so I did,
and here we are.

184
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,960
- Out of 7 billion people
in the world,

185
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,662
she's writing about me?

186
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,730
- Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

187
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,298
making you maybe our only hope.

188
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,733
No presh.
- So, what do we do?

189
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,301
Do we just--
do we just wait for her

190
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,737
to maybe write about
the lost key?

191
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,312
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin--

192
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,650
God, it's a sex scene.

193
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,320
- I'm worried that
the plan won't work.

194
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,657
- Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

195
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,627
- What plan is that?

196
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,929
- The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

197
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,199
- I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

198
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,333
It's incredibly dangerous,

199
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,036
and I don't think
that we are...

200
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,272
fully...you know, equipped.

201
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,174
- I assure you, Quentin,

202
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,976
I'm fully equipped.

203
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,778
- I can't ask you

204
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,980
to risk your life
for my quest.

205
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,284
Real talk, I'm a very
self-interested person,

206
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,086
and I want magic back.

207
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,956
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

208
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,291
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

209
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,728
Maybe you have to bring me

210
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,362
or you totally fail, hmm?

211
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,632
- I don't think
that's how this works.

212
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,166
If it's such a bad idea,

213
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,735
then why are you going?

214
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,738
- Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

215
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,374
A quest is supposed
to change a quester.

216
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,644
The person who starts it

217
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,146
couldn't, you know, finish it.

218
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,115
- So run a gauntlet
to get the keys,

219
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,017
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

220
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,185
that can get the keys?

221
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,987
- Exactly.

222
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,089
I know what I have to be

223
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,258
to win this quest:

224
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,728
a...hero.

225
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,398
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

226
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,133
- Okay...

227
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,670
I reject your whole premise.

228
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,005
That's all people do:
try to change.

229
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,307
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

230
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,842
Believe me, I tried.

231
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,144
Eventually, I realized

232
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,380
the brave thing is to be you

233
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,083
and accept the consequences.

234
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,419
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

235
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,224
*

236
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,698
Shit's about to
get awkward, huh?

237
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,265
- Oh, because you slept with Q?

238
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,367
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

239
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,671
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

240
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,407
Robbing the Library?
- Oh.

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,375
- How are you even
gonna get there?

242
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,812
- We have a traveler:
Victoria.

243
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,079
- But how's she
gonna travel you?

244
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,314
That part's a spell.

245
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,382
- Yeah, so,
we're not doing that.

246
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,118
Travelers are
magical creatures--

247
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,721
- They're technically hybrids.
- Fine, whatever.

248
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,823
All I know is that
we can use her DNA.

249
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,191
She's gonna build
a Mirror Bridge.

250
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,192
All we need is, uh--

251
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,228
- PHD-level skill and patience

252
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,197
and more traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

253
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,465
- Exactly.

254
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,868
- Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

255
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,237
from when I was a--
- Sociopathic energy monster?

256
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,905
- Yeah.

257
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,207
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

258
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,776
a hundred miles apart, max.

259
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,878
- Well, we're better
than hedges.

260
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,813
- Light years better?

261
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,749
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

262
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,217
So if you're not perfect,
Victoria dies.

263
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,219
- Forget it. I'm out.
- Okay, hold on.

264
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,355
- I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

265
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,824
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

266
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,359
- Look, we don't do it
until we get the math right,

267
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,827
and I'll make sure that--

268
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,263
- None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

269
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,497
Alice does.

270
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,100
Get her to do the math,
we can talk.

271
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,401
- She said,
"I already talked to Alice.

272
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,469
She's not gonna help."

273
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,171
- Look, it's simple.

274
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,940
Prove to me the Bridge
will be stable, or I'm out.

275
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,308
- Victoria, wait...

276
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,811
Oh, shit. Fuck.

277
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,147
What do we do now?

278
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,254
- What is she after?

279
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,523
Harriet?
- What do you mean?

280
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,159
- If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

281
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,761
we deserve to know why.

282
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,900
- Okay.

283
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,268
Library's been searching
for this thing

284
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,170
called the Alexandria Cell.

285
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,538
It's a huge battery.

286
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,241
Librarians from
ancient Egypt made it,

287
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:25,145
and if they followed the plans,
it is fucking massive.

288
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,214
- And Harriet thinks
that they found it?

289
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,884
- Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

290
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,886
big magic.

291
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,354
But none of it matters

292
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,423
if we can't get to
the Satellite branch.

293
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,262
- Niffin notes.

294
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,498
Pages and pages
about Mirror Bridges.

295
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,001
- How did--how did you
convince her to help us?

296
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:51,004
- Didn't. I stole them.

297
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,472
I'll make copies
and put them back

298
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,974
before she comes home

299
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,408
from wherever she went
to sulk and be a martyr.

300
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,945
- No, this is--
this is not a good idea.

301
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,413
- Under the circumstances,
it seemed worth it.

302
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,315
See?

303
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,517
Just had to be myself.

304
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,354
*

305
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:14,928
*

306
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,463
Okay...

307
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,866
Be careful
when you step through.

308
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,871
*

309
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:32,479
*

310
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:38,952
*

311
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,955
Okay. I have to stay
and feed the sigils,

312
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,457
so, you know, take your time.

313
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,926
- We'll hurry.

314
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,861
Thank you, Victoria.

315
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:53,066
*

316
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,571
*

317
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:08,848
*

318
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,524
- Okay, she says,
"Go left down the hall."

319
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,994
Said, "You'll find
the book drop chute.

320
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,495
The Bookwyrm's inside."
Okay.

321
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,431
- Wait, have you
been here before?

322
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,536
- Well, okay--well, let's go
before Victoria bleeds out.

323
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,537
Come on.

324
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:37,277
*

325
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,646
- Penny said he'd hide it
in a book.

326
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:46,920
*

327
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,597
Make sure to check the chute.
Might be stuck.

328
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,000
*

329
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,072
- Okay, no books.
Just an actual dragon.

330
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,539
- Ooh.

331
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,541
Uh...God damn it,
we don't have time.

332
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,611
- Oh, fuck it.

333
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,713
*

334
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,349
Hello?
- Key's not here.

335
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,018
- What?

336
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,120
So, Penny failed?

337
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,589
- Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I--

338
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,157
- Well, we can't just
stand here and wait.

339
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,026
- No, we need the key.

340
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,728
- I just realized
my part to play in this quest.

341
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,064
I'm here to tell you
it is time to cut bait and run.

342
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,599
Just live another day.
- No, we can't.

343
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,134
Kady and Harriet--

344
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,069
- They are on their own trip,
and call me crazy,

345
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,538
but I don't think any of this
is worth Victoria's life.

346
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,742
*

347
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,079
*

348
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,618
Alice, what the hell?

349
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,486
*

350
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,688
Come on, we gotta go.

351
00:15:55,722 --> 00:16:02,962
*

352
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,503
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

353
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,638
Come with me.

354
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,041
- No, they'll be stuck.

355
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,744
*

356
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,446
- Do what you need to do.

357
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:26,053
*

358
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,327
- This can't be right.
The key's not there.

359
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,564
Quentin's about to bail
without me.

360
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,232
- Well, "about to": That means
that there's still a chance.

361
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,533
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

362
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,601
- And what--and what
the hell is Alice is doing

363
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,236
in the Satellite branch?

364
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,205
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

365
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,375
Alice, if you're in there,
please...

366
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,510
Where is the key?

367
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,114
Fuck.

368
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,653
- Here's a bright idea:
Keep fucking reading.

369
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,262
- We're better than hedges.
- Light years better?

370
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:13,233
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

371
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,335
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

372
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,170
- Then help.

373
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,176
- Look, bottom line, Alice,

374
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,578
you told Poppy
the Mirror Bridge won't work.

375
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,680
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

376
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,117
- It won't work.

377
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,551
Would you rather
I didn't tell her

378
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,354
and just let you guys
walk off into deep space?

379
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,493
- She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

380
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,863
- Once.

381
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,566
I wasn't there long.

382
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,535
- "Brochure makes it
sound great.

383
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,339
"They collect knowledge,
keep it safe...

384
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,606
but from who?"

385
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,208
- Whom.

386
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,377
- I said "whom."

387
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,448
- "The Library buries
information.

388
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,417
"Only the people they choose
get access.

389
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,685
The rest of us"--

390
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,320
- You just wanna let
all that knowledge loose

391
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,588
for anyone to use?

392
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,191
For good or bad?

393
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,226
- "Don't tell me there isn't
a book in the Library

394
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,895
"you wouldn't die to read.

395
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,664
"If you help us,

396
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,133
we can offer you a piece
of what we find there."

397
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,401
- What's that?

398
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,336
- The biggest battery
ever created.

399
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,672
You wanna help Penny?
This is how.

400
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,178
- If I say yes,
that means risking lives

401
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,214
to give you power
maybe no one should have.

402
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,715
*

403
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,384
No thank you.

404
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:41,721
*

405
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,438
- Door was stuck.

406
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,209
Can I have one of those?

407
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,177
So, I left.

408
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:07,347
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

409
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,551
- It's "ball and chain,"
I think you mean.

410
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:15,288
- No, that doesn't
sound right.

411
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,291
- I think I know
what you mean.

412
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,361
I lost a lot of
people recently,

413
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,197
including kind of myself.

414
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,234
- Mm. That makes no sense.

415
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,401
- I had everything.

416
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,702
I knew everything
there was to know

417
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:30,770
in every book and more,

418
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,640
and--and I lost it.

419
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,210
- I'm sorry...

420
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:43,683
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

421
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,818
My daughter's gone...

422
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,820
forever.

423
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,423
You forgot some stuff?

424
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:54,794
What you lost
is still out there.

425
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,829
Go get it back.

426
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,503
Umber's ass, I am drunk.

427
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,687
- Oh, Christ.

428
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,256
No. The answer's no.

429
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,624
- You don't even know
what I want.

430
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,426
- You're a Library groupie.

431
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,329
You got a knowledge boner.

432
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,798
How'd you find out
about this place anyway?

433
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,500
It was Karen.
- What?

434
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,867
N--no, Penny told me.

435
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,536
- Bad news, book tart.

436
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,439
The Library's closed,
indefinitely.

437
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,543
- I got bored waiting.

438
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,448
Look, I need to
speak to your boss.

439
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,749
I have something she'll want.

440
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,652
- Oh.
You're so mysterious.

441
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,621
- It's important, asshole.

442
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,389
- Fine.

443
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,493
Come on then.

444
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,495
- Wait, this shouldn't work
without Wellspring magic.

445
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,630
How can you--

446
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,570
- Alice Quinn.

447
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,639
- Till we meet again,
book tart.

448
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,776
- If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

449
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,446
- Roguish belligerency is
a common trait among travelers.

450
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,682
- How can he take people
with him when he travels?

451
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,484
You really do have a battery.

452
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,818
- Is that why you're here?

453
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,554
- No, I don't care
about the battery.

454
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,689
Well...of course I do.

455
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,524
All I want is a Library Card.

456
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,894
- We're no longer accepting
new applications.

457
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,829
- What do you know
about niffins?

458
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,731
I was one for a time,

459
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,700
and this is all I can remember.

460
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,435
It's half of a puzzle.

461
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,836
The other pieces
fell out of my head,

462
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,639
but...they could be
inside your books.

463
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,108
- You are suggesting
a trade of information?

464
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,543
- More than that.

465
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,445
I wanna finish what I started:

466
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,681
a Grand Unified
Theory of Magic.

467
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,717
- But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

468
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,552
I'm afraid your experiences
as a niffin

469
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,821
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

470
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,459
- It's in my book.

471
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,861
You don't want me to finish.
Is--is that it?

472
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,597
- There is something
you could do for us,

473
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,864
and, in exchange,
we would give you

474
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:15,468
full access to our collection.

475
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,838
You're familiar with
the Quest for the Seven Keys?

476
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,611
*

477
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,546
Excuse me a moment.

478
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:33,453
- Alice, what the hell?

479
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,954
*

480
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,523
- Come on, we gotta go.

481
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:40,727
*

482
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,762
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

483
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,931
How do you just keep appearing?

484
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,633
What were you--

485
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,437
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

486
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,838
- Q, you have to go.

487
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,006
- Okay, great, then let's go.

488
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,777
Alice, come on.

489
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,012
- Q, please...

490
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:09,822
- The bookish girl
joins the Library.

491
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,492
Didn't see that coming.

492
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,526
- Yeah, little bit
of a bigger problem.

493
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,563
Quentin left without the key!

494
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,031
This is it, right?

495
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,435
An actual...answer?

496
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,473
- Yes, I do want to make
a final statement.

497
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,541
I...

498
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,043
hate...Fillory.

499
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,879
It is a backwards,

500
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,047
malodorous shithole

501
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,184
full of animals who are smarter
than they're supposed to be

502
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:42,622
and humans who are
so much dumber.

503
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,658
And what you'd call
indoor plumbing,

504
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,060
we on Earth would call

505
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,162
a war crime.

506
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,231
But...

507
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,967
when I was drowning,

508
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,069
Fillory saved me,

509
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,572
and now it's my turn
to save Fillory.

510
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,174
But I can't do that
if my head's in a basket,

511
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,512
so if it pleases the--

512
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,115
You guys...

513
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,485
I demand that this
trial/peasant uprising

514
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,120
be dismissed...

515
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,155
*

516
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,858
Your honorable wombat-ness.

517
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,161
- What the shit is this?

518
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,263
Why is he talking
to a marsupial?

519
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,499
This is not at all relevant!
- Would you just chill?

520
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,667
You're gonna
piss her off again.

521
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,569
- Next!

522
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,087
- How's Alice?

523
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,124
- Uh, well, she's not my
favorite person at the moment,

524
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,960
but, um, the transfer worked,
so thank you.

525
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,161
- Oh, well,
I'm glad to hear it.

526
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,730
- Yeah.
- Uh...so you're...

527
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,032
- Yeah, back to powered up.

528
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,601
- Good...

529
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,903
because I've, uh, come here

530
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,606
to collect on that favor
that you owe me.

531
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,143
- Oh, my God.

532
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,012
- Yeah.

533
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,314
Side-effect from
the powder that I gave you.

534
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,049
- Um...
- Oh, don't worry.

535
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,018
No, you haven't used
nearly enough.

536
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,086
No, you're safe.

537
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,554
Look, there is a treatment,

538
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:24,056
but it's big magic.

539
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,658
I--I can't do it on myself,

540
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,661
because it would just
make things worse.

541
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,731
So...

542
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,766
Here's what we'll need.

543
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,703
My office, 3:00 p.m.

544
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,671
- A fairy?

545
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,206
And I can't see her,

546
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,642
because I've never
made a fairy deal?

547
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,644
- This is what they do...
- Okay?

548
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,679
- They hide behind
powerful people,

549
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,348
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

550
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,217
- Wait a minute,
at Irene's house,

551
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,719
Penny said that he--

552
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,687
he thought that he saw
something moving

553
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,355
that--that Q and I
couldn't see.

554
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,191
- There's more of them?
Oh, no.

555
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,993
- No, what I'm--
what I'm saying is

556
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:04,764
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

557
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,365
They were doing chores.

558
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,234
Wait, what was
Irene's fairy doing?

559
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,169
- Just...

560
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,104
standing there,
like she was waiting on Irene,

561
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,240
and her head was
sort of bowed, but--

562
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,708
- Bowed? Wait, that's--

563
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,376
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

564
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,245
- You can't trust them.

565
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,381
I don't know why they'd be
acting that way, but--

566
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,717
- Do you have slavery
in Fillory?

567
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,087
- If these fairies are slaves,
you'd be better off.

568
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,656
- Fen...

569
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:33,092
no one is better off
with slavery.

570
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,128
Look, I have this
tiny spark of magic,

571
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,164
and it seems like when I use it

572
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:41,300
to do good things,
to help people,

573
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,035
it--it grows.

574
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:46,205
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

575
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,174
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

576
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,342
I have to use it.

577
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,645
- My daughter's dead
because of them.

578
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,781
- Fen, we need to know,

579
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,248
and I can't see her.

580
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,051
You need to talk
to Irene's fairy.

581
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:10,396
*

582
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,835
*

583
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,771
Hey. What's your name?

584
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,306
Yes...

585
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,775
I can see you.

586
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,377
- I'm--I'm not
supposed to talk to you.

587
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,079
- Why not?

588
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,119
- You must answer me.

589
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,422
Irene will be very angry
if you don't.

590
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,190
- Of course. Of course.

591
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,059
Um...I'm sorry.

592
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,328
- Oh, shit, you are her slave.
- No.

593
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,197
Okay, Miss McAllistair keeps us
safe from bad Magicians.

594
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,099
She hides us.

595
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,835
- In exchange for what?

596
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,839
- How is it you can see me?

597
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,306
- I made a deal.

598
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,710
Well, a deal was made
on my behalf...

599
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,345
with a fairy.

600
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,681
- But...there are
no other fairies.

601
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,187
Oh, I'm late.
Miss will be waiting.

602
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,095
Uh...can we...

603
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,396
talk again tomorrow?

604
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,866
Miss Irene won't be home.

605
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,903
My name is Skye.

606
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,476
*

607
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,912
- No sign of fairies.

608
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,446
- Then let's look
in here first.

609
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,115
If, uh, we don't find Skye,

610
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,383
we'll have to break
into the main house,

611
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,351
hope that Irene
doesn't come home.

612
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,326
*

613
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,496
- Fen, what is it?
What do you see?

614
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,832
- It's her. It's Skye. She's--

615
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,867
oh, God, they cut off her leg.

616
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:02,441
*

617
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,943
- Hey...

618
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:10,216
*

619
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,420
It's what the powder's made of.

620
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,288
- What happened to you?

621
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,957
Who did this?

622
00:38:59,471 --> 00:38:59,738
- They left.

623
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:04,075
The Mirror Bridge is gone.

624
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,011
Alice...

625
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,513
just talk to me.

626
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,848
Come on.

627
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,450
- I'm not Alice.

628
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:17,956
God damn it!

629
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:24,963
*

630
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:41,547
- What is it?

631
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,115
- Quentin and Poppy:
sex scene.

632
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:46,151
- That you kinda
skimmed, prude.

633
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,987
- Um, not that I'm complaining,
but, um...

634
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,457
- Why am I doing this?
- What?

635
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,858
- 'Cause I can only go so long

636
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,126
feeling completely
alone and worthless,

637
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,029
before I break down
and do something stupid.

638
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,035
- Right.
You're an idiot.

639
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,772
- Quentin?
- No, me!

640
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,208
Look, I get it.

641
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,210
You didn't want me
to bail on you, so you lied,

642
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,046
and then I bailed
on you anyway.

643
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,916
Be mad.
Don't be stupid.

644
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:21,753
- I buried it. Sorry.

645
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,955
I spent so much
of my life alone,

646
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,057
the thought of spending
the rest of time--

647
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,228
I thought you were my friend,

648
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,997
and I thought...

649
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,533
if you couldn't find
the key, eventually you'd...

650
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,101
I don't know--

651
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,069
- What, decide to hang out
in your dumb tent?

652
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,572
- I thought we'd
spruce it up together.

653
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,812
Look...

654
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:50,048
don't ask me
how I know this, but...

655
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:54,620
you are the only person
who cried when I died.

656
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,623
We are friends,
and I appreciate you,

657
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,991
so, listen...

658
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,960
once you show me
where the key is buried,

659
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,529
Sylvia...

660
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:06,064
is gonna take you
to the Library map room.

661
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,535
You are going to be
very popular.

662
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:14,640
*

663
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:24,149
Well, um, I guess this is it.

664
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,953
- Well, until the next time
I die, anyway.

665
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,088
- And I want the record to show
that I helped you get that key,

666
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,190
making this the second time
I saved your ass.

667
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,092
- Oh, my gosh.

668
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,027
Wait--whoa, hey, whoa!

669
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,229
I need to--
still need to get in there.

670
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,634
Sylvia?

671
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,235
What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

672
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,206
- Alice, what the hell?

673
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,010
*

674
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,012
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

675
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,014
- Q, please...

676
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:05,156
*

677
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:09,995
- Hey.
- Hey.

678
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:12,964
- What was that?

679
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,266
- It sounded like
a dragon barfing.

680
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,702
We gotta get back to
the book chute. Come on.

681
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,069
- Sh--

682
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,270
*

683
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,676
- Holy shit!

684
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,612
- Did you--okay.

685
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,279
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

686
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,048
*

687
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,316
Oh, but Penny...

688
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,318
- No, we don't have time.
I'm sorry.

689
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,887
Shit.

690
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:42,961
*
