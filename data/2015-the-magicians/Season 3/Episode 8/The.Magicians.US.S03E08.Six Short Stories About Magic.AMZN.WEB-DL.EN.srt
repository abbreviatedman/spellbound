and I read that you were here,

178
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:09,928
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

179
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:11,296
and so I did,
and here we are.

180
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,965
- Out of 7 billion people
in the world,

181
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,667
she's writing about me?

182
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,735
- Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

183
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,303
making you maybe our only hope.

184
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,738
No presh.

185
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:21,306
Do we just--
do we just wait for her

186
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,742
to maybe write about
the lost key?

187
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:32,317
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin--

188
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,655
God, it's a sex scene.

189
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,325
- I'm worried that
the plan won't work.

190
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,662
- Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

191
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,934
- The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

192
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:52,204
- I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

193
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:53,338
It's incredibly dangerous,

194
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:56,041
and I don't think
that we are...

195
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:59,277
fully...you know, equipped.

196
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,179
- I assure you, Quentin,

197
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,981
I'm fully equipped.

198
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,783
- I can't ask you

199
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,985
to risk your life
for my quest.

200
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:11,289
Real talk, I'm a very
self-interested person,

201
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:13,091
and I want magic back.

202
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,961
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

203
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:18,296
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

204
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,733
Maybe you have to bring me

205
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,367
or you totally fail, hmm?

206
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,637
- I don't think
that's how this works.

207
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,171
If it's such a bad idea,

208
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:27,740
then why are you going?

209
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:30,743
- Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

210
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:34,379
A quest is supposed
to change a quester.

The person who starts it

212
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:39,151
couldn't, you know, finish it.

213
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:42,120
- So run a gauntlet
to get the keys,

214
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:44,022
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

215
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,190
that can get the keys?

216
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:46,992
- Exactly.

217
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,094
I know what I have to be

218
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,263
to win this quest:

219
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:54,733
a...hero.

220
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:58,403
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

221
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:00,138
- Okay...

222
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,675
I reject your whole premise.

223
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,010
That's all people do:
try to change.

224
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,312
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

Believe me, I tried.

226
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:11,149
Eventually, I realized

227
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,385
the brave thing is to be you

228
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:16,088
and accept the consequences.

229
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:19,424

Yeah, I'm not really worried

233
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:37,676
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

234
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,412
Robbing the Library?
- Oh.

235

- How are you even
gonna get there?

236
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:44,817
- We have a traveler:
Victoria.

237
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,084
- But how's she
gonna travel you?

238
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:47,319
That part's a spell.

239
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:49,387
- Yeah, so,
we're not doing that.

240
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,123
Travelers are
magical creatures--

241
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,726
- They're technically hybrids.
- Fine, whatever.

242
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,828
All I know is that
we can use her DNA.

243
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:58,196
She's gonna build
a Mirror Bridge.

244
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,197
All we need is, uh--

245
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,233
- PHD-level skill and patience

246
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:04,202
and more traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

247
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,470
- Exactly.

248
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:07,873
- Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

249
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:10,242
from when I was a--

250
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:11,910
- Yeah.

251
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,212
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

252
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:15,781
a hundred miles apart, max.

253
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:17,883
- Well, we're better
than hedges.

254
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:21,754
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

255
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:24,222
So if you're not perfect,
Victoria dies.

256
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:26,224
- Forget it. I'm out.
- Okay, hold on.

257
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:28,360
- I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

258
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,829
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

259
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,364
- Look, we don't do it
until we get the math right,

260
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,832
and I'll make sure that--

261
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:36,268
- None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

262
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,502
Alice does.

263
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:40,105
Get her to do the math,
we can talk.

264
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,406
- She said,
"I already talked to Alice.

265
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,474
She's not gonna help."

266
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:44,176
- Look, it's simple.

267
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,945
Prove to me the Bridge
will be stable, or I'm out.

268
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,313
- Victoria, wait...

269
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,816
Oh, shit. Fuck.

270
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,152

271
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,528
Harriet?

272
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:06,164
- If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

273
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:07,766
we deserve to know why.

274
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,905
- Okay.

275
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,273
Library's been searching
for this thing

276
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,175
called the Alexandria Cell.

277
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,543
It's a huge battery.

278
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:21,246
Librarians from
ancient Egypt made it,

279
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,150
and if they followed the plans,
it is fucking massive.

280
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:27,219
- And Harriet thinks
that they found it?

281
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,889
- Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

282
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,891
big magic.

283
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,359

convince her to help us?

288

- Didn't. I stole them.

289
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:52,477
I'll make copies
and put them back

290
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,979

to sulk and be a martyr.

355
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,241
in the Satellite branch?

356
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:45,210
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

357
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:48,380
Alice, if you're in there,
please...

358
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,515
Where is the key?

359
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,119
Fuck.

360
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,658
- Here's a bright idea:
Keep fucking reading.

361
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:09,267
- We're better than hedges.

362
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:13,238
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

363
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:15,340
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

364

365
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:23,181

366
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,583

the Mirror Bridge won't work.

367
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,685
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

368
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,122
- It won't work.

369
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:31,556
Would you rather
I didn't tell her

370
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,359
and just let you guys
walk off into deep space?

371
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:40,498
- She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

372
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,868
- Once.

373
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,571
I wasn't there long.

374
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,540

377

- Whom.

378
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:57,382
- I said "whom."

379
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:01,453
- "The Library buries
information.

380
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:04,422
"Only the people they choose
get access.

This is how.

No. The answer's no.

The Library's closed,
indefinitely.

- If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

You really do have a battery.

about the battery.

444
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,694
Well...of course I do.

445
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:31,529
All I want is a Library Card.

446

I was one for a time,

449

The other pieces
fell out of my head,

inside your books.

453
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:49,113

a trade of information?

454
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:50,548
- More than that.
