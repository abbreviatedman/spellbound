1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,537
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,705
Fray isn't yours.

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,752
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,875
She died?

5
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,081
<i>All right, I can help you.</i>

6
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,461
Is that cocaine?

7
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,009
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

8
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,421
- Penny, Sylvia.
- I'm babysitting now?

9
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,927
Sylvia is your supervisor.

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,786
If you can't bring me back,
you die too, Penny.

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,097
Benedict, do not do it!

12
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,429
No!

13
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,270
Mmm. Yummy.

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,602
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

15
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,231
for some time.

16
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,483
She planned this.

17
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,359
I'm your queen,
you motherfuckers!

18
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,032
What're you doing?

19
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,482
Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

20
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,601
Wait a minute,
I know these people.

21
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,287
Well, every book is here,

22
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,217
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

23
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,898
It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

24
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,458
So we need a gatekeeper.

25
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,692
<i>What about the Library's dragon?</i>

26
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,423
They call it the Bookwyrm.

27
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,717
I hear they use it

28
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,364
to send books
to and from the Underworld.

29
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,630
Well, what if the person
was a book?

30
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,345
Say I get the key
and send it back up,

31
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,787
it's stuck in
the Satellite Library.

32
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,427
We need another Traveler.

33
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,853
Okay, I work
with this group now.

34
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,397
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

35
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,919
You have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

36
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,479
I'm sorry we're cursed.

37
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,796
Whoa!

38
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,504
Damn it!

39
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,379
Hey, uh, guy...

40
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,381
Yeah, what is this?

41
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,807
Temp housing,
and before you ask,

42
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,555
yes, the system is still down.

43
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,887
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

44
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,138
The outhouses to your left.

45
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,893
Outhouses here?
No, look, I... I'm...

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,315
I'm just looking for someone.

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,482
Did you file a request?

48
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,859
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

49
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,861
This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

50
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,364
I might be able to help,
unofficially,

51
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,786
if, uh...

52
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,539
Yeah, uh...

53
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,958
What the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

54
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,785
Uh, is there money here?

55
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,664
And what about
the White Walkers?

56
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,044
Oh, the White Walkers?

57
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,716
Yeah, I mean,
those guys are bad news.

58
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,523
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

59
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,990
came and, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

60
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,427
- Wait, who was that?
- You know!

61
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,299
You know, dope outfit.

62
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,518
Speaks in rhymes.
Has eight dragons.

63
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,600
Where did he get
so many dragons?

64
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,350
I mean, that's the question.

65
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,942
So, you know, he came in

66
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,611
and, uh, won the throne game.

67
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,030
Well, no one does
a twist like they do.

68
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,400
Okay, what's your friend's name?

69
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,451
Hi, um,
I'm looking for Benedict.

70
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,575
- Go away.
- Benedict?

71
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,281
I'm dead! Go away!

72
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,082
It's... It's Penny.

73
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,544
Oh, Penny, my friend!

74
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,379
Oh. Okay. Um...

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,791
Good hug.

76
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,297
Yeah, let's call this, man.

77
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,147
You can't imagine
how terrible this place is.

78
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,796
I'm so happy to see you.

79
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,007
That isn't to say...
I'm sorry you're dead.

80
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,425
Yeah, about that...

81
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,351
No, I'm... I'm not technically.

82
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,599
I came to find you.

83
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,476
- You did?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,561
Okay, we're...

85
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,937
And we're hugging again.

86
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,522
When you died,
were you holding a key?

87
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,150
Are you here for the key?

88
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,657
- Yeah, do you have it?
- I thought you, uh...

89
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,121
Because we were
friends, that, um...

90
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,623
Oh. Um...

91
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,502
Yeah, look,
we're not not friends.

92
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,920
It's just, you know,

93
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,963
I'm on a mission,
and if we are friends...

94
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,128
- I am your friend!
- Then give me the key,

95
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,425
please?

96
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,340
- They took it.
- Who?

97
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,969
Well, the Library.

98
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,721
Of course. Fuck me.

99
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,019
I just snuck out of there.
Damn it!

100
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,624
Well, the Library's the only part of
the Underworld

101
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,015
that functions now.
It's well-protected.

102
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,691
I'd say just cut your losses.

103
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,178
There's no way you can
get in there.

104
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,687
Yeah, there is.

105
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,863
I'm a Librarian.

106
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,657
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

107
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,368
Oh, well, like I said...

108
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,945
Best let go of it.

109
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,119
Of all of magic?

110
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,492
Would you let that go?

111
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,711
Well, I'll figure it out,

112
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,664
find the key,
avoid indentured servitude...

113
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,545
Even in death,
you lead an exciting life.

114
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,876
- I'll help.
- No, that's okay.

115
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,426
No, I insist!
I can help you sneak.

116
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,754
I can...

117
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,055
Great. Yeah!

118
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,803
We'll go together.

119
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,496
I just... You know, I just need to
find one more person...

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,601
Okay.

121
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,729
And then, we'll loop back
and grab you in 10, okay?

122
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,889
- Okay, no hugging.
- Okay.

123
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,189
- All right.
- I'll be here.

124
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,857
- I'm gonna go this way.
- Okay.

125
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,000
- Hi, Penny.
- Sylvia?

126
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,915
You're about to do
something stupid.

127
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,665
I'm sorry...

128
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,050
For leaving you behind in...

129
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,719
Oh, you mean in the Poison Room?

130
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,012
God, I was a goner.

131
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,805
- I'm not mad.
- I am.

132
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,132
Well, don't be.

133
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,801
I'm fine, well, for a dead girl.

134
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,790
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

135
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,555
between the
stuck-in-the-astral thing

136
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,390
and the
'bout-to-fuck-up-royally thing.

137
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,520
How do you know I'm...

138
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,148
Oh. The same way I knew
that you were here right now.

139
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,530
- It is written.
- What is that?

140
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,528
Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

141
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,701
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

142
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,244
Follow me.

143
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,142
Cassandra? I brought a friend.

144
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,311
Alice?

145
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,075
Cassandra, calm down. It's okay.

146
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,204
- It's okay.
- What the hell is going on?

147
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,203
Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

148
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,752
I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

149
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,232
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

150
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,463
I don't know what to tell you.

151
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,415
She's been here, like,
thousands of years.

152
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,256
- Make him go away.
- I can't. He needs your help.

153
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,638
Here's the deal.

154
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,719
- Cassandra has a gift.
- A curse.

155
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,435
She kinda got involved
with this guy...

156
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,647
God.

157
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,184
And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

158
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,190
so he gave her magical sight.

159
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,737
She can see the future.

160
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,155
This should sound familiar,

161
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,698
if you've read
any ancient myths.

162
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,196
The one that no one believed

163
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,198
and it drove her batshit crazy?

164
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,870
Quiet, squirrels.

165
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,869
I guess some Librarians
found her

166
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,825
and got her to start
writing everything down.

167
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,036
Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

168
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,665
of the people in the Library?

169
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,917
Well, yes and no.

170
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,090
She can only write
one at a time.

171
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,634
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

172
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,712
to, like,
industrialize her thing,

173
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,200
and that's how
all books were written.

174
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,760
That stopped when magic did,

175
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,012
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

176
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,761
Trying to concentrate.

177
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,354
Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,806
and I read that you were here,

179
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,607
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

180
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,060
and so I did, and here we are.

181
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,714
Out of seven billion people
in the world,

182
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,979
she's writing about me?

183
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,360
Well, you and your buds
are on a quest to restore magic,

184
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,066
making you maybe our only hope.

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,400
- No presh.
- So, what do we do?

186
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,069
Do we just...
Do we just wait for her

187
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,780
to maybe write about
the lost key?

188
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:29,040
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin... Oh!

189
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,259
God, it's a sex scene.

190
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,092
<i>I'm worried that
the plan won't work.</i>

191
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,016
Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

192
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,219
What plan is that?

193
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,485
The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

194
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,229
I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

195
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,109
It's incredibly dangerous,

196
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,733
and I don't think that we are

197
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,611
fully, you know, equipped.

198
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,654
I assure you, Quentin,

199
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,327
I'm fully equipped.

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,412
I can't ask you

201
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,660
to risk your life for my quest.

202
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,995
Real talk, I'm a very
self-interested person,

203
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,329
and I want magic back.

204
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,583
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

205
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,089
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

206
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,296
Maybe you have to bring me

207
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,096
or you totally fail. Hmm?

208
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,057
I don't think
that's how this works.

209
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,302
If it's such a bad idea,
then why are you going?

210
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,185
Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

211
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,684
A quest is supposed
to change a quester.

212
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,814
The person who starts it

213
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,567
couldn't, you know, finish it.

214
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,779
So run a gauntlet
to get the keys,

215
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,656
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

216
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,862
that can get the keys?

217
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,955
Exactly.

218
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,744
I know what I have to be

219
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,416
to win this quest.

220
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,787
A hero.

221
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,044
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

222
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,676
Okay...

223
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,841
I reject your whole premise.

224
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,547
Try to change.

225
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,054
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

226
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,476
Believe me, I tried.

227
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,433
Eventually, I realized

228
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,148
the brave thing is to be you

229
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,146
and accept the consequences.

230
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,649
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

231
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,290
Shit's about
to get awkward, huh.

232
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,833
Oh, because you slept with Q?

233
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,162
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

234
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,251
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

235
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,673
Robbing the Library?

236
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,759
Oh.

237
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,130
How are you even
gonna get there?

238
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,429
We have a Traveler. Victoria.

239
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,756
But how's she gonna travel you?

240
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,057
That part's a spell.

241
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,135
Yeah, so, we're not doing that.

242
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,810
Travelers are magical
creatures...

243
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,309
- They're technically hybrids.
- Fine, whatever.

244
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,439
All I know is that
we can use her DNA.

245
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,309
She's gonna build
a Mirror Bridge.

246
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,560
All we need is...

247
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,945
PHD-level skill and patience

248
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,899
and more Traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

249
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,237
Exactly.

250
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,489
Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

251
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,947
- from when I was a...
- Sociopathic energy monster?

252
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,201
Yeah.

253
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,912
Bridges are usually built between
hedge witch safe houses

254
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,369
a hundred miles apart, max.

255
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,499
Well, we're better than hedges.

256
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,590
Light years better?

257
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,403
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

258
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,794
So if you're not perfect,
Victoria dies.

259
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,929
Forget it. I'm out.

260
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,014
Okay, hold on.

261
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,090
I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

262
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,426
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

263
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,080
Look, we don't do it
until we get the math right,

264
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,144
and I'll make sure that...

265
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,563
None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

266
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,273
Alice does.

267
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,225
Get her to do the math,
we can talk.

268
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,214
She said,
"I already talked to Alice."

269
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,238
"She's not gonna help."

270
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,859
Look, it's simple.

271
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,566
Prove to me the Bridge will be
stable, or I'm out.

272
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,026
Victoria, wait...

273
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,361
Oh, shit.

274
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,077
What do we do now?

275
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,917
What is she after?

276
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,292
- Harriet?
- What do you mean?

277
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,844
If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

278
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,216
we deserve to know why.

279
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,134
Okay.

280
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,970
Library's been searching
for this thing

281
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,851
called the Alexandria Cell.

282
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,307
It's a huge battery.

283
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,942
Librarians from
ancient Egypt made it,

284
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,691
and if they followed the plans,
it is fucking massive.

285
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,899
And Harriet thinks
that they found it?

286
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,485
Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

287
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,740
big magic.

288
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,080
But none of it matters

289
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,726
if we can't get to
the Satellite branch.

290
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,754
Niffin notes.

291
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,336
Pages and pages
about Mirror Bridges.

292
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,631
How did... How did you
convince her to help us?

293
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,341
Didn't. I stole them.

294
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,253
I'll make copies
and put them back

295
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,595
before she comes home

296
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,205
from wherever she went
to sulk and be a martyr.

297
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,562
No, this is not a good idea.

298
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,140
Under the circumstances,
it seemed worth it.

299
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,566
See?

300
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,560
Just had to be myself.

301
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,659
Okay...

302
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,874
Be careful
when you step through.

303
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,560
Okay. I have to stay
and feed the sigils,

304
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,188
so, you know, take your time.

305
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,519
We'll hurry.

306
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,898
Thank you, Victoria.

307
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,058
Okay, she says,
"Go left down the hall."

308
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,561
Said, "You'll find
the book drop chute."

309
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,225
"The Bookwyrm's inside." Okay.

310
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,807
Wait, have you been here before?

311
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,341
Well, okay... Well, let's go
before Victoria bleeds out.

312
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,365
Come on.

313
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,996
Penny said
he'd hide it in a book.

314
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,135
Make sure to check the chute.
Might be stuck.

315
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,689
Okay, no books.
Just an actual dragon.

316
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,271
God damn it, we don't have time.

317
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,903
Oh, fuck it.

318
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,316
- Hello?
- Key's not here.

319
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,072
What?

320
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,161
So, Penny failed?

321
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,282
Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I...

322
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,812
Well, we can't just
stand here and wait.

323
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,577
No, we need the key.

324
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,958
I just realized my part
to play in this quest.

325
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,632
I'm here to tell you
it is time to cut bait and run.

326
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,299
- Just live another day.
- No, we can't.

327
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,718
Kady and Harriet...

328
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,636
They are on their own trip,
and call me crazy,

329
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,214
but I don't think any of this
is worth Victoria's life.

330
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,190
Alice, what the hell?

331
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,822
Come on, we gotta go.

332
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,749
Where are they?

333
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,839
I don't know.

334
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,338
Come with me.

335
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,587
No, they'll be stuck.

336
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,964
Do what you need to do.

337
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,192
This can't be right.
The key's not there.

338
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,648
Quentin's about
to bail without me.

339
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,553
Well, "about to". That means
that there's still a chance.

340
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,888
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

341
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,778
And what the hell
is Alice is doing

342
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,872
in the Satellite branch?

343
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,822
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

344
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,413
Alice, if you're
in there, please...

345
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,453
Where is the key?

346
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,835
Fuck.

347
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,881
Here's a bright idea.
Keep fucking reading.

348
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,267
<i>We're better than hedges.</i>

349
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,357
<i>Light years better?</i>

350
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,350
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

351
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,440
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

352
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,531
Then help.

353
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,407
Look, bottom line, Alice,

354
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,864
you told Poppy
the Mirror Bridge won't work.

355
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,915
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

356
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,162
It won't work.

357
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,706
Would you
rather I didn't tell her

358
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,954
and just let you guys

359
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,255
walk off into deep space?

360
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,636
She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

361
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,306
Once.

362
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,637
I wasn't there long.

363
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,719
"Brochure makes it sound great."

364
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,522
"They collect knowledge,
keep it safe..."

365
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,809
"But from who?"

366
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,313
Whom.

367
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,566
I said "whom."

368
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,615
"The Library buries information."

369
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,785
"Only the people they choose
get access."

370
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,904
"The rest of us..."

371
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,517
You just wanna let
all that knowledge loose

372
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,577
for anyone to use?

373
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,746
For good or bad?

374
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,398
"Don't tell me there isn't
a book in the Library"

375
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,754
"you wouldn't die to read."

376
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,590
"If you help us,"

377
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,210
"we can offer you a piece
of what we find there."

378
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,545
What's that?

379
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,470
The biggest battery
ever created.

380
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,799
You wanna help Penny?
This is how.

381
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,266
If I say yes,
that means risking lives

382
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,315
to give you power
maybe no one should have.

383
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,485
No thank you.

384
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,633
Door was stuck.

385
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,172
Can I have one of those?

386
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,928
So, I left.

387
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,633
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

388
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,727
It's "ball and chain,"
I think you mean.

389
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,806
No, that doesn't sound right.

390
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,600
I think I know what you mean.

391
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,275
I lost a lot of people recently,

392
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,198
including kind of myself.

393
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,327
Mmm. That makes no sense.

394
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,528
I had everything.

395
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,974
I knew everything
there was to know

396
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,998
in every book and more,

397
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,040
and... And I lost it.

398
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,953
I'm sorry...

399
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,798
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

400
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,053
My daughter's gone...

401
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,380
Forever.

402
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,474
You forgot some stuff?

403
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,936
What you lost
is still out there.

404
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,098
Go get it back.

405
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,693
Umber's ass, I am drunk.

406
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,872
Oh, Christ.

407
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,333
No. The answer's no.

408
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,793
You don't even know what I want.

409
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,377
You're a Library groupie.

410
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,630
You got a knowledge boner.

411
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,633
How'd you find out
about this place anyway?

412
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,638
- It was Karen.
- What?

413
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,102
No, Penny told me.

414
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,679
Bad news, book tart.

415
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,186
The Library's closed,
indefinitely.

416
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,481
I got bored waiting.

417
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,636
Look, I need to speak
to your boss.

418
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,946
I have something she'll want.

419
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,700
You're so mysterious.

420
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,447
It's important, asshole.

421
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,202
Fine.

422
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,419
Come on then.

423
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,525
Wait, this shouldn't work
without Wellspring magic.

424
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,665
How can you...

425
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,634
Alice Quinn.

426
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,594
Till we meet again, book tart.

427
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,019
If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

428
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,563
Roguish belligerency is
a common trait among Travelers.

429
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,517
How can he take people
with him when he travels?

430
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,560
You really do have a battery.

431
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,024
Is that why you're here?

432
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,647
No, I don't care
about the battery.

433
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,570
Well, of course I do.

434
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,567
All I want is a Library Card.

435
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,661
We're no longer accepting
new applications.

436
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,035
What do you know about Niffins?

437
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,916
I was one for a time,

438
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,868
and this is all I can remember.

439
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,544
It's half of a puzzle.

440
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,071
The other pieces
fell out of my head,

441
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,795
but they could be
inside your books.

442
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,968
You are suggesting
a trade of information?

443
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,678
More than that.

444
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,383
I wanna finish what I started,

445
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,845
<i>A Grand Unified Theory of Magic.</i>

446
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,894
But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

447
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,682
I'm afraid your experiences
as a Niffin

448
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,231
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

449
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,980
It's in my book.

450
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,817
You don't want me to finish.
Is... Is that it?

451
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,802
There is something
you could do for us,

452
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,136
and, in exchange,
we would give you

453
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,402
full access to our collection.

454
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,032
You're familiar with
the Quest for the Seven Keys?

455
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,456
Excuse me a moment.

456
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,546
Alice, what the hell?

457
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,633
Come on, we gotta go.

458
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,941
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

459
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,141
How do you just keep appearing?

460
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,771
What were you...

461
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,526
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

462
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,981
Q, you have to go.

463
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,275
Okay, great, then let's go.

464
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,949
Alice, come on.

465
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,826
Q, please...

466
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,633
The bookish girl joins the Library.
Didn't see that coming.

467
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,586
Yeah, little bit
of a bigger problem.

468
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,173
Quentin left without the key!

469
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,759
This is it, right?

470
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,596
An actual answer?

471
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,058
<i>Yes, I do want to make
a final statement.</i>

472
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,144
I...

473
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,775
Hate... Fillory.

474
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,572
It's a backwards,

475
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,775
malodorous shithole

476
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,953
full of animals who are smarter
than they're supposed to be

477
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,249
and humans who are
so much dumber.

478
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,294
And what you'd call
indoor plumbing,

479
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,792
we on Earth would call

480
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,919
a war crime.

481
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,001
But

482
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,677
when I was drowning,

483
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,801
Fillory saved me,

484
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,178
and now it's my turn
to save Fillory.

485
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,931
But I can't do that
if my head's in a basket,

486
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,105
so if it pleases the...

487
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,354
You guys...

488
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,063
I demand that this
trial/peasant uprising

489
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,397
be dismissed...

490
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,535
Your honorable wombat-ness.

491
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,910
<i>What the shit is this?</i>

492
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,036
Why is he talking
to a marsupial?

493
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,146
- This is not at all relevant!
- Would you just chill?

494
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,786
You're gonna piss her off again.

495
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,458
Next!

496
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,852
How's Alice?

497
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,902
Uh, well, she's not my
favorite person at the moment,

498
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,695
but the transfer worked,
so thank you.

499
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,981
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear it.

500
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,399
- Yeah.
- Uh, so you're...

501
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,777
Yeah, back to powered up.

502
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,236
Good...

503
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,242
Because I've come here

504
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,041
to collect on that favor
that you owe me.

505
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,916
Oh, my God.

506
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,214
Yeah.

507
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,129
Side-effect from
the powder that I gave you.

508
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,803
Oh, don't worry.

509
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,753
No, you haven't used
nearly enough.

510
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,848
No, you're safe.

511
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,173
Look, there is a treatment,

512
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,805
but it's big magic.

513
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,305
I can't do it on myself,

514
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,353
because it would just
make things worse.

515
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,765
So...

516
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,435
Here's what we'll need.

517
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,608
My office, 3:00 p.m.

518
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,068
<i>A fairy?</i>

519
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,991
And I can't see her,

520
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,285
because I've never
made a fairy deal?

521
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,283
- This is what they do...
- Okay?

522
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,330
They hide behind
powerful people,

523
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,160
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

524
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,994
Wait a minute, at Irene's house,

525
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,374
Penny said that he...

526
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,331
He thought that he saw
something moving

527
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,166
that... That Q and I
couldn't see.

528
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,965
There's more of them? Oh, no.

529
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,717
No, what I'm...
What I'm saying is

530
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,469
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

531
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,142
They were doing chores.

532
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,011
Wait, what was
Irene's fairy doing?

533
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,221
Just...

534
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,856
Standing there,
like she was waiting on Irene,

535
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,025
and her head was
sort of bowed, but...

536
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,352
Bowed? Wait, that's...

537
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,187
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

538
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,647
You can't trust them.

539
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,200
I don't know why they'd be
acting that way, but...

540
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,902
Do you have slavery in Fillory?

541
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,573
If these fairies are slaves,
you'd be better off.

542
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,124
Fen...

543
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,914
No one is better off
with slavery.

544
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,710
Look, I have this
tiny spark of magic,

545
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,920
and it seems like when I use it

546
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,094
to do good things,
to help people,

547
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,512
it grows.

548
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,761
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

549
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,926
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

550
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,352
I have to use it.

551
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,268
My daughter's dead
because of them.

552
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,437
Fen, we need to know,

553
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,018
and I can't see her.

554
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,570
You need
to talk to Irene's fairy.

555
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,172
Hey. What's your name?

556
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,050
Yes...

557
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,543
I can see you.

558
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,929
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

559
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,598
Why not?

560
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:26,978
Um...

561
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,603
You must answer me.

562
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,187
Irene will be very angry
if you don't.

563
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,896
Of course. Of course.

564
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,728
Um... I'm sorry.

565
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,064
- Oh, shit, you are her slave.
- No.

566
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,900
Okay, Miss McAllistair keeps
us safe from bad Magicians.

567
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,781
She hides us.

568
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,328
In exchange for what?

569
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,457
How is it you can see me?

570
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,832
I made a deal.

571
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,087
Well, a deal was made
on my behalf...

572
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,088
With a fairy.

573
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,088
But there are no other fairies.

574
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,596
Oh, I'm late.
Miss will be waiting.

575
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,140
Can we talk again tomorrow?

576
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,522
Miss Irene won't be home.

577
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,522
My name is Skye.

578
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,118
No sign of fairies.

579
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,207
Then let's look in here first.

580
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,374
If we don't find Skye,

581
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,123
we'll have to break
into the main house,

582
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,954
hope that Irene
doesn't come home.

583
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,389
Fen, what is it?
What do you see?

584
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,967
It's her. It's Skye. She's...

585
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,226
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

586
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,565
Hey...

587
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,155
It's what the powder's made of.

588
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,832
What happened to you?

589
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,246
Who did this?

590
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,999
Irene did.

591
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,129
They left.
The Mirror Bridge is gone.

592
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,293
Alice...

593
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,425
Just talk to me.

594
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,797
Come on.

595
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,174
I'm not Alice.

596
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,810
God damn it!

597
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,703
What is it?

598
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,537
Quentin and Poppy's sex scene.

599
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,004
That you kinda skimmed, prude.

600
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,708
Um, not that
I'm complaining, but, um...

601
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,051
- Why am I doing this?
- What?

602
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,637
'Cause I can only go so long

603
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,965
feeling completely alone
and worthless

604
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,763
before I break down
and do something stupid.

605
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,848
Right. You're an idiot.

606
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,275
- Quentin?
- No, me!

607
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,071
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

608
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,069
You didn't want me
to bail on you, so you lied,

609
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,242
and then I bailed on you anyway.

610
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,411
Be mad. Don't be stupid.

611
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,286
I buried it. Sorry.

612
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,751
I spent so much
of my life alone,

613
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,703
the thought of spending
the rest of time...

614
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,214
I thought you were my friend,

615
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,793
and I thought...

616
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,220
If you couldn't find
the key, eventually you'd...

617
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:34,932
I don't know...

618
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,696
What, decide to hang out
in your dumb tent?

619
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,808
I thought
we'd spruce it up together.

620
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,274
Look,

621
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,735
don't ask me how
I know this, but,

622
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,782
you are the only person
who cried when I died.

623
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,322
We are friends,
and I appreciate you,

624
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,153
so, listen,

625
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,739
once you show me
where the key is buried,

626
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,199
Sylvia

627
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,876
is gonna take you
to the Library map room.

628
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,206
You are going to be
very popular.

629
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,978
Well, um, I guess this is it.

630
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,686
Well, until the next time
I die, anyway.

631
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,963
And I want the record to show
that I helped you get that key,

632
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,024
making this the second time
I saved your ass.

633
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,905
Oh, my gosh.

634
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,823
Wait... Whoa, hey, whoa!

635
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,901
I need to...
Still need to get in there.

636
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,283
Sylvia?

637
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,123
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

638
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,044
Alice, what the hell?

639
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,795
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

640
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,717
Q, please...

641
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,024
- Hey.
- Hey.

642
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,605
What was that?

643
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,108
It sounded like
a dragon barfing.

644
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,958
We gotta get back to
the book chute. Come on.

645
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,412
Holy shit!

646
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,290
Did you... Okay.

647
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,117
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

648
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,162
But Penny...

649
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,168
No, we don't have time.
I'm sorry.

650
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,625
Shit.
