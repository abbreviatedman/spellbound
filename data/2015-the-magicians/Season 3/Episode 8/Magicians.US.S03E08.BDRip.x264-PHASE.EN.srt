00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,537
QUENTIN: Previously on
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,704
Fray isn't yours.

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,784
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,874
She died?

5
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,112
IRENE: <i>All right,
I can help you.</i>

6
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,483
ls that cocaine?

7
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,023
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

8
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,214
(SNIFFS)

9
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,458
Penny, Sylvia.
I'm babysitting now?

10
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,961
Sylvia is your supervisor.

11
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,724
If you can't bring me back,
you die too, Penny.

12
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,129
Benedict,
do not do it!

13
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,462
No!

14
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,304
Mmm. Yummy.

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,636
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

16
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,231
for some time.

17
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,502
She planned this.

18
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:35,375
(SCREAMING) I'm your queen,
you motherfuckers!

19
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,043
What're you doing?

20
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,482
Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

21
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,542
Wait a minute'
I know these people.

22
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,315
THE LIBRARIAN:
Well, every book is here,

23
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,084
all the books of all the
people who ever lived.

24
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,847
It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

25
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,484
So we need a gatekeeper.

26
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,653
POPPY: <i>What about
the Library's dragon?</i>

27
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,423
They call it the Bookwyrm.

28
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,724
I hear they use it

29
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,321
to send books
to and from the Underworld.

30
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,664
Well, what if the person
was a book?

31
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,360
Say I get the key
and send it back up,

32
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,734
it's stuck in
the Satellite Library.

33
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,431
We need another Traveler.

34
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,872
<i>Okay, Work
with ms group now.</i>

35
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,411
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,877
You have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

37
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,505
I'm sorry we're cursed.

38
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,789
Whoa!

39
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,532
Damn it!

40
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,712
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,328
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

42
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,406
Hey, uh, guy...

43
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,411
Yeah, what is this?

44
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,818
Temp housing,
and before you ask,

45
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,582
yes, the system
is still down.

46
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,921
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,152
The outhouses
to your left.

48
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,918
Outhouses here?
No, look, I... I'm...

49
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,326
I'm just looking
for someone.

50
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,488
Did you file a request?

51
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,858
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

52
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,870
This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

53
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,366
I might be able to help,
unofficially,

54
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,805
if, uh...

55
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,543
Yeah, uh...

56
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,977
What the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

57
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,811
Uh, is there money here?

58
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,675
And what about
the White Walkers?

59
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,049
Oh, the White Walkers?

60
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,713
Yeah, I mean,
those guys are bad news.

61
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,484
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

62
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,957
came and, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

63
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,460
Wait, who was that?
You know!

64
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,325
You know, dope outfit.

65
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,523
Speaks in rhymes.
Has eight dragons.

66
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,627
Where did he get
so many dragons?

67
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,364
I mean,
that's the question.

68
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,967
So, you know, he came in

69
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,634
and, uh, won the throne game.

70
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,045
Well, no one does
a twist like they do.

71
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,403
Okay, what's your
friend's name?

72
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,482
Hi, um, I'm looking
for Benedict.

73
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,575
BENEDICT: Go away.
Benedict?

74
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,311
I'm dead!
Go away!

75
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,082
It's... It's Penny.

76
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,555
Oh, Penny, my friend!

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,387
Oh. Okay. Um...

78
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,824
Good hug.

79
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,325
Yeah, let's call this, man.

80
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,094
You can't imagine
how terrible this place is.

81
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,827
I'm so happy
to see you.

82
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,029
That isn't to say...
I'm sorry you're dead.

83
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,430
Yeah, about that...

84
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,370
No, I'm...
I'm not technically.

85
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,601
I came to find you.

86
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,506
You did?
Yeah.

87
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,577
Okay, we're...

88
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,942
And we're hugging again.

89
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,544
When you died,
were you holding a key?

90
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,183
Are you here for the key?

91
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,691
Yeah, do you have it?
I thought you, uh...

92
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,120
Because we were
friends, that, um...

93
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,625
Oh. Um...

94
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,532
Yeah, look,
we're not not friends.

95
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,931
It's just, you know,

96
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,968
I'm on a mission,
and if we are friends.“

97
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,128
lam your friend!
Then give me the key,

98
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,433
Phase?

99
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,368
They took it.
Who?

100
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,971
Well, the Library.

101
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,744
Of course. Fuck me.

102
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,041
L just snuck out of there.
Damn it!

103
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,584
Well, the Library's the
only part of the Underworld

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,052
that functions now.
It's well-protected.

105
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,713
I'd say just
cut your losses.

106
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,121
There's no way you can
get in there.

107
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,717
Yeah, there is.

108
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,891
I'm a Librarian.

109
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,657
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

110
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,395
Oh, well, like I said...

111
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,956
Best lei go of it.

112
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,130
Of all of magic?

113
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,503
Would you let that go?

114
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,742
Well, I'll figure it out,

115
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,675
find the key,
avoid indentured servitude...

116
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,575
Even in death,
you lead an exciting life.

117
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,909
I'll help
No, that's okay.

118
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,448
No, I insist!
I can help you sneak.

119
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,778
Loan...

120
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,077
Great. Yeah!

121
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,816
We'll go together.

122
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,446
L just... You know, I just need
to find one more person...

123
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,615
<i>0K3'! -</i>

124
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,692
And then, we'll loop back
and grab you in 10, okay?

125
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,919
Okay, no hugging-
Okay.

126
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,188
All right.
I'll be here.

127
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,854
I'm gonna go this way.
Okay.

128
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,011
Hi, Penny.
Sylvia?

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,941
You're about to do
something stupid.

130
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,681
I'm sorry...

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,055
For leaving you behind in...

132
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,721
oh, you mean
in the Poison Room?

133
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,019
God, I was a goner.

134
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,821
I'm not mad.
I am.

135
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,157
Well, don't be.

136
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,821
I'm fine, well,
for a dead girl.

137
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,723
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

138
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,563
between the
stuck-in-the-astral thing

139
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,398
and the
'bout-to-fuck-up-royally thing.

140
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,527
How do you know I'm...

141
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,164
Oh. The same way I knew
that you were here right now.

142
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,538
It is written.
What is that?

143
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,544
Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

144
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,706
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

145
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,249
Follow me.

146
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,164
Cassandra?
I brought a friend.

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,345
Alice?

148
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,743
(SCREAMS)

149
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,208
(SCREAMS)

150
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,086
Cassandra, calm down.
It's okay.

151
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,218
It's okay.
What the hell is going on?

152
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,229
Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

153
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,755
I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

154
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,198
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

155
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,462
I don’t know
what to tell you.

156
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,434
She's been here, like,
thousands of years.

157
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,267
Make him go away.
I can't. He needs your help.

158
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,637
Here's the deal.

159
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,747
Cassandra has a gift.
A curse.

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,451
She kinda got involved
with this guy...

161
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,644
God.

162
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,221
And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

163
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,224
so he gave her
magical sight.

164
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,759
She can see the future.

165
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,158
This should sound familiar,

166
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,729
if you've read
any ancient myths.

167
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,230
The one that
no one believed

168
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,232
and it drove her
batshit crazy?

169
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,892
Quiet, squirrels.

170
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,903
I guess some Librarians
found her

171
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,836
and got her to start
writing everything down.

172
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,066
Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

173
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,665
of the people
in the Library?

174
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,936
Well, yes and no.

175
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,104
She can only write
one at a time.

176
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,648
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

177
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,739
to, like,
industrialize her thing,

178
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,149
and that's how
all books were written.

179
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,776
That stopped
when magic did,

180
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,015
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

181
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,788
Trying to concentrate.

182
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,353
Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

183
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,826
and I read that
you were here,

184
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,624
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

185
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,096
and so I did,
and here we are.

186
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,663
Out of seven billion people
in the world,

187
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,995
she's writing about me?

188
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,366
Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

189
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,097
making you maybe
our only hope.

190
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,366
<i>Nu mesh.
Se, what do we do'!?</i>

191
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,100
Do we just...
Do we just wait for her

192
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,803
to maybe write about
the lost key?

193
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,867
(PAPER RUSTLING)

194
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,042
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin... Oh!

195
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,281
God, it's a sex scene.

196
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,118
<i>QUENTIN: I'm worried that
the plan won't work.</i>

197
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,026
Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

198
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,226
What plan is that?

199
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,499
The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

200
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,228
I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

201
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,132
It's incredibly dangerous,

202
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,732
and I don't think
that we are

203
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,641
fully, you know, equipped.

204
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,671
I assure you, Quentin,

205
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,346
I'm fully equipped.

206
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,415
I can't ask you

207
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,680
to risk your life
for my quest.

208
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:03,810
(SIGHS)

209
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,020
Real talk, I'm a very
self-interested person,

210
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,354
and I want magic back.

211
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,590
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

212
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,096
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,322
Maybe you have to bring me

214
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,096
or you totally fail. Hmm?

215
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,070
I don't think
that's how this works.

216
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,339
(SIGHS) If it's such a bad
idea, then why are you going?

217
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,209
Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

218
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,703
A quest is supposed
to change a quester.

219
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,845
The person who starts it

220
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,576
couldn't, you know,
finish it.

221
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,778
So run a gauntlet
to get the keys,

222
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,686
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

223
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,884
that can get the keys?

224
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:41,948
Exactly.

225
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,752
I know
what I have to be

226
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,421
to win this quest.

227
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,793
A hero.

228
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,067
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

229
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,701
Okay...

230
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,875
I reject your whole premise.

231
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,575
That's all people do:
Try to change.

232
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,071
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

233
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,479
Believe me, I tried.

234
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,444
Eventually, I realized

235
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,147
the brave thing is to be you

236
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,153
and accept the consequences.

237
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,654
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

238
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,303
Shit's about
to get awkward, huh.

239
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,832
Oh, because
you slept with Q?

240
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,133
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

241
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,268
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

242
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,676
Robbing the Library?

243
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,768
Oh.

244
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,139
How are you even
gonna get there?

245
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,443
We have a Traveler.
Victoria.

246
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,781
But how's she
gonna travel you?

247
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,081
That park's a spell.

248
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,145
Yeah, so,
we're not doing that.

249
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,815
Travelers are magical
creatures...

250
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,325
They' re technically hybrids.
Fine, whatever.

251
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,459
All I know is that
we can use her DNA.

252
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,322
She's gonna build
a Mirror Bridge.

253
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,591
All we need is...

254
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,961
PHD-level skill
and patience

255
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,936
and more Traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

256
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,265
Exactly.

257
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,500
Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

258
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,974
from when I was a...
Sociopathic energy monster?

259
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,204
Yeah.

260
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,944
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

261
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,380
a hundred miles apart' max.

262
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,508
Well, we're better
than hedges.

263
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,607
Light years better?

264
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,351
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

265
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,821
So if you're not perfect,
Victoria dies.

266
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,947
VICTORIA: Forget it. I'm out.

267
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,015
KADY: Okay, hold on.

268
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,117
I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

269
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,460
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

270
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,021
Look, we don't do it
until we get the math right,

271
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,122
and I'll make sure that...

272
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,566
None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

273
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,298
Alice does.

274
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,236
Get her to do the math,
we can talk.

275
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,163
She said, "I already
talked to Alice.

276
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,231
"She's not gonna help."

277
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,867
Look, it's simple.

278
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,572
Prove to me the Bridge will be
stable, or I'm out.

279
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,046
Victoria, wait...

280
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,377
Oh, shit.

281
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,079
What do we do now?

00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,916
What is she after?

Harriet?
What do you mean?

285
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,857
If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

286
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,229
we deserve to know why.

for this thing

289
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,873
called the Alexandria Cell.

290
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,343
It's a huge battery.

291
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,945
Librarians from
ancient Egypt made it,

292
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,710
and if they followed the
plans, it is fucking massive.

293
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,909
And Harriet thinks
that they found it?

294
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,513
Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

295
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,751
big magic.

296
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,087

How did... How did you
convince her to help us?

301
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,375
Didn't. I stole them.

302

355
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,194
This can't be right.
The key's not there.

356
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,667
Quentin's about
to bail without me.

357
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,465
Well, "about to". That means
that there's still a chance.

358
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,834
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

359
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,805
And what the hell
is Alice is doing

360
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:38,865
in the Satellite branch?

361
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,842
You'd think she could
at least answer that

362
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,439
Alice, if you're
in there, please...

363
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,475
Where is the key?

364
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,846
Fuck.

365
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,892
Here's a bright idea.
Keep fucking reading.

00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,466
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

370
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,532
Then help.

371
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,414
KADY: Look,
bottom line, Alice,

372
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,883
you told Poppy the Mirror
Bridge won't work.

373
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,920
Now Victoria's
not gonna help.

374
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,178
It won't work.

375
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,723
Would you
rather I didn't tell her

376
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:28,985
and just let you guys

377
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,254
walk off into deep space?

(MOUTHING)

379
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,659
She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

380
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,330
Once.

381
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,671

Whom.

386
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,577
(OUT LOUD) I said "whom."

This is how.

401
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,282

that means risking lives

402

maybe no one should have.

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,644
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

409
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,752
It's "ball and chain,"
I think you mean.

No, that doesn't
sound right.

411
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,628
I think I know what you mean.

412
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,291

people recently,

413
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,203
including kind of myself.

414
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,340
Mmm. That makes no sense.

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,533

kind of problem at all?

No. The answer's no.

Roguish belligerency is a

with him when he travels?

451

You really do
have a battery.

452
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,052
Is that why you're here?

453
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,658
No, I don't care
about the battery.

454
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,592
Well, of course I do.

455
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,589
All I want is a Library Card.

456
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,661

new applications.

00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,929
I was one for a time,

459
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,905

all I can remember.

460
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,566

461
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,076
The other pieces
fell out of my head,

462
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,806
but they could be
inside your books.

463
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,973
You are suggesting
a trade of information?

464
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,677
More than that.

465
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,409

I'm afraid your experiences
as a Niffin

469
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,261
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

470
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,988
It's in my book.

471
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,833
You don't want me to finish.
ls... ls that it?

472
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,768
There is something
you could do for us,

473
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,100
and, in exchange,
we would give you

474
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,436
full access to our collection.
