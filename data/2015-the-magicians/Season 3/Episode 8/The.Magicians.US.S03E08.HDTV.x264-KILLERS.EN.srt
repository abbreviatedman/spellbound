1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,407
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,715
Fray isn't yours. Your real
daughter died during childbirth.

3
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:05,825
She died?

4
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:08,044
- All right, I can help you.
- Is that cocaine?

5
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:10,844
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

6
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:14,498
- Penny, Sylvia.
- I'm babysitting now?

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,872
Sylvia is your supervisor.

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,843
If you can't bring me
back, you die too, Penny.

9
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:19,939
Benedict... do not do it!

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,191
No!

11
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,272
Mmm... yummy.

12
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:29,339
Children of Earth have been making a
mess of things here for some time.

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,608
She planned this.

14
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:34,645
I'm your queen, you motherfuckers!

15
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:39,316
- What are you doing?
- Short-circuiting your panic attack.

16
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,958
Wait a minute, I... I... I
know these people.

17
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:41,971
Well, every book is here,

18
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,841
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

19
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,956
It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

20
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,298
So we need a gatekeeper.

21
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,852
What about the Library's dragon?

22
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:50,444
They call it the Bookwyrm.

23
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:53,224
I hear they use it to send books
to and from the Underworld.

24
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:55,599
Well, what if the person was a book?

25
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,469
Say I get the Key and send it back up,

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,538
it's stuck in the Satellite Library.
We need another traveler.

27
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:02,973
Okay, I work with this group now.

28
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:05,509
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,284
You have to go, if that's
what you wanna do.

30
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:08,612
I'm sorry we're cursed.

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,573
Damn it!

33
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,512
Hey, uh, guy...

34
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,514
Yeah, what is this?

35
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,916
Temp housing, and before you ask,

36
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,685
yes, the system is still down.

37
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,852
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

38
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,388
The outhouses to your left.

39
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,022
Outhouses here? No, look, I... I'm...

40
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,733
- I'm just looking for someone.
- Did you file a request?

41
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,963
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

42
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:39,032
This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

43
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,468
I might be able to help, unofficially,

44
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,071
if, uh...

45
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,606
Yeah, uh...

46
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,774
what the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

47
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,985
Uh... is there money here?

48
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,747
And what about the White Walkers?

49
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,115
Oh, the White Walkers?

50
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,783
Yeah, I mean, those guys are bad news.

51
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,514
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

52
00:02:58,525 --> 00:02:59,986
came and, uh, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

53
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,555
- W... wait, who was that?
- You know!

54
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:04,424
You know, dope outfit.

55
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,659
Speaks in rhymes. Has eight dragons.

56
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,728
Where did he get so many dragons?

57
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:12,665
I mean... that's the question.

58
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,066
So, you know, he came in

59
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,736
and, uh, won the throne game.

60
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,771
Well, no one does a twist like they do.

61
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,507
Okay, what's your friend's name?

62
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,575
Hi, um, I'm looking for Benedict.

63
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,678
- Go away.
- Benedict?

64
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,412
I'm dead! Go away!

65
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:29,123
It's... it's Penny.

66
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,651
Oh, Penny, my friend!

67
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:35,187
Oh... okay. Um...

68
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,656
Good hug.

69
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,458
Yeah, let's call this, man.

70
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,305
You can't imagine how
terrible this place is.

71
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:42,927
I'm so happy to see you.

72
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,164
That isn't to say I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry you're dead.

73
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,532
Oh, yeah, about that:

74
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,466
No, I'm... I'm not technically, uh...

75
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,701
I came to find you.

76
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,602
- You did?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,672
- Oh!
- Okay, we're...

78
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,940
and we're hugging again.

79
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,511
When you died, were you holding a key?

80
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,251
Are you here for the key?

81
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,783
- Yeah, do you have it?
- I thought you, uh...

82
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:08,118
because we were friends, that, um...

83
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:10,555
Oh, um...

84
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:13,624
Yeah, look, we're not not friends.

85
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:14,852
It's just, you know,

86
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,127
I'm... I'm on a mission,
and... and if we are friends...

87
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,996
- I am your friend!
- Then give me the key...

88
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:20,869
uh, please?

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,014
- They... they took it.
- Who?

90
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,170
Well, the Library.

91
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,972
Of course. Fuck me.

92
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,008
I just snuck out of there. Damn it!

93
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,846
Well, the Library's the only part of
the Underworld that functions now.

94
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,145
It's well-protected.

95
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:38,582
I'd say just cut your losses. There's
no way you can get in there.

96
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,550
Yeah, there is.

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,984
I'm a Librarian.

98
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,754
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

99
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,489
Oh, well, like I said...

100
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,491
best let go of it.

101
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,161
Of all of magic?

102
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:54,997
Would you let that go?

103
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:56,833
Oh, well, I'll figure it out,

104
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:58,768
find the Key,
avoid indentured servitude...

105
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:01,536
Oh, even in death, you lead an
exciting life. I'll... I'll help.

106
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,710
- No... no, that's okay.
- I insist! I can help you sneak.

107
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,174
I can...

108
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,176
Great. Yeah!

109
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,667
We'll go together.

110
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:11,013
I just... you know, I just
need to find one more person...

111
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,307
And then, uh, we'll loop back
and grab you in ten, okay?

112
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:15,015
- Okay, no hugging.
- Okay.

113
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:16,339
- All right.
- I'll be here.

114
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,064
- I'm gonna go this way.
- Okay.

115
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:35,174
- Hi, Penny.
- Sylvia?

116
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,547
You're about to do something stupid.

117
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm sorry...

118
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,145
for leaving you behind in...

119
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,813
Oh, you mean in the Poison Room?

120
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,114
God, I was a goner.

121
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,916
- I'm not mad.
- I am.

122
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:50,341
Well, don't be.

123
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:53,053
I'm fine, well, for a dead girl.

124
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:54,988
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

125
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,658
between the stuck-in-the-astral thing

126
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,660
and the 'bout-to-fuck-up-royally thing.

127
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,327
How do you know I'm...

128
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:03,330
Oh, the same way I knew
that you were here right now.

129
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,482
- It is written.
- What is that?

130
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:07,634
Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

131
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,804
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

132
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:11,057
Follow me.

133
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,694
Cassandra? I brought a friend.

134
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,471
Alice?

135
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:50,757
Cassandra, calm down. It's okay.

136
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:53,427
- It's okay.
- What the hell is going on?

137
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:56,430
Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

138
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,855
I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

139
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,583
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

140
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:04,525
I don't know what to tell you. She's
been here thousands of years.

141
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:07,519
- Make him go away.
- I can't. He needs your help.

142
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,881
Here's the deal:

143
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,950
- Cassandra has a gift.
- A curse.

144
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,753
She kinda got involved with this guy...

145
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,255
God.

146
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:23,423
And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

147
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,424
so he gave her magical sight.

148
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,960
She can see the future.

149
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,394
This should sound familiar,

150
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,929
if you've read any ancient myths.

151
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,430
The one that no one believed

152
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,432
and it drove her batshit crazy?

153
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,101
Quiet, squirrels.

154
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,103
I guess some Librarians found her

155
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,072
and got her to start
writing everything down.

156
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,274
Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

157
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:42,908
of the people in the Library?

158
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:44,143
Well, yes and no.

159
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,312
She can only write one at a time.

160
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,881
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

161
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,800
to, like, industrialize her thing,

162
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,385
and that's how all books were written.

163
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:53,986
That stopped when magic did,

164
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:56,254
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

165
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,290
Trying to concentrate.

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,592
Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

167
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,061
and I read that you were here,

168
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,829
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,297
and so I did, and here we are.

170
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:06,899
Out of 7 billion people in the world,

171
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,049
she's writing about me?

172
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,602
Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

173
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,304
making you maybe our only hope.

174
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:13,605
- No presh.
- So, what do we do?

175
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,307
Do we just... do we just wait for her

176
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,609
to maybe write about the lost key?

177
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:26,318
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin...

178
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,662
God, it's a sex scene.

179
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,325
I'm worried that the plan won't work.

180
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,157
Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

181
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,582
What plan is that?

182
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,744
The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

183
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:46,065
I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

184
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:50,006
It's incredibly dangerous, and
I don't think that we are...

185
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,310
fully... you know, equipped.

186
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,178
I assure you, Quentin,

187
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:56,913
I'm fully equipped.

188
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:58,682
I can't ask you

189
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,917
to risk your life for my quest.

190
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:07,057
Real talk, I'm a very self-interested
person, and I want magic back.

191
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,893
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

192
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:12,328
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

193
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,597
Maybe you have to bring me

194
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:16,399
or you totally fail, hmm?

195
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,501
I don't think that's how this works.

196
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,169
If it's such a bad idea,

197
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,604
then why are you going?

198
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:24,607
Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

199
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:28,411
A quest is supposed to change a quester.

200
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,513
The person who starts it

201
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:33,115
couldn't, you know, finish it.

202
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,085
So run a gauntlet to get the keys,

203
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:37,953
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

204
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,188
that can get the keys?

205
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:40,923
Exactly.

206
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,058
I know what I have to be

207
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,261
to win this quest:

208
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,597
a... hero.

209
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:52,434
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

210
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:54,102
Okay...

211
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,538
I reject your whole premise.

212
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:58,940
That's all people do: try to change.

213
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,310
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

214
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,744
Believe me, I tried.

215
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:05,113
Eventually, I realized

216
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:07,416
the brave thing is to be you

217
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,051
and accept the consequences.

218
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,454
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

219
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,565
Shit's about to get awkward, huh?

220
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:25,827
Oh, because you slept with Q?

221
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:28,402
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

222
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:31,505
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

223
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:34,442
- Robbing the Library?
- Oh.

224
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:36,410
How are you even gonna get there?

225
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,679
We have a traveler: Victoria.

226
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:41,238
But how's she gonna travel you?
That part's a spell.

227
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,392
Yeah, so, we're not doing that.

228
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,169
- Travelers are magical creatures...
- They're technically hybrids.

229
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,587
Fine, whatever.

230
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:49,689
All I know is that we can use her DNA.

231
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,762
She's gonna build a Mirror Bridge.

232
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:55,195
- All we need is, uh...
- PHD-level skill and patience

233
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:58,165
and more traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

234
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,499
Exactly.

235
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,768
Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

236
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:04,135
- from when I was a...
- Sociopathic energy monster?

237
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,389
Yeah.

238
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,174
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

239
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:09,642
a hundred miles apart, max.

240
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:11,778
Well, we're better than hedges.

241
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:13,301
Light years better?

242
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,614
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

243
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:18,035
So if you're not perfect, Victoria dies.

244
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:20,186
- Forget it. I'm out.
- Okay, hold on.

245
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:22,355
I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

246
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,535
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

247
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:27,307
We don't do it until we get the
math right, and I'll make sure that...

248
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:30,229
None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

249
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,530
Alice does.

250
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,032
Get her to do the math, we can talk.

251
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,422
She said, "I already talked to Alice.
She's not gonna help."

252
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,946
Look, it's simple.

253
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,650
Prove to me the Bridge
will be stable, or I'm out.

254
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:42,119
Victoria, wait...

255
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,464
Oh, shit. Fuck.

256
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:48,079
What do we do now?

257
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,220
What is she after?

258
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,555
- Harriet?
- What do you mean?

259
00:11:57,565 --> 00:12:00,091
If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

260
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,600
we deserve to know why.

261
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,764
Okay.

262
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,233
Library's been searching for this thing

263
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,101
called the Alexandria Cell.

264
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,570
It's a huge battery.

265
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,205
Librarians from ancient Egypt made it,

266
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:19,076
and if they followed the plans,
it is fucking massive.

267
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,178
And Harriet thinks that they found it?

268
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:24,748
Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

269
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,750
big magic.

270
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,352
But none of it matters

271
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,405
if we can't get to the Satellite branch.

272
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,226
Niffin notes.

273
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:39,529
Pages and pages about Mirror Bridges.

274
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,898
How did... how did you
convince her to help us?

275
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,901
Didn't. I stole them.

276
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,482
I'll make copies and put them
back before she comes home

277
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,333
from wherever she went
to sulk and be a martyr.

278
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:51,808
No, this is... this is not a good idea.

279
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,410
Under the circumstances,
it seemed worth it.

280
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,279
See?

281
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,547
Just had to be myself.

282
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,460
Okay...

283
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,728
Be careful when you step through.

284
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:35,817
Okay. I have to stay
and feed the sigils,

285
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:38,453
so, you know, take your time.

286
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:39,787
We'll hurry.

287
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:41,689
Thank you, Victoria.

288
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:11,519
Okay, she says, "Go left down the hall."

289
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,039
Said, "You'll find the book drop chute."

290
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,490
"The Bookwyrm's inside." Okay.

291
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,391
Wait, have you been here before?

292
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,531
Well, okay... well, let's go before
Victoria bleeds out. Come on.

293
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:33,673
Penny said he'd hide it in a book.

294
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,591
Make sure to check the chute.
Might be stuck.

295
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:58,931
Okay, no books. Just an actual dragon.

296
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,532
Ooh.

297
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,534
Uh... God damn it, we don't have time.

298
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:05,605
Oh, fuck it.

299
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:09,677
- Hello?
- Key's not here.

300
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:11,876
What?

301
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:14,012
So, Penny failed?

302
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:16,377
Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I...

303
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,049
Well, we can't just stand here and wait.

304
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,884
No, we need the key.

305
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:22,754
I just realized
my part to play in this quest.

306
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:24,923
I'm here to tell you
it is time to cut bait and run.

307
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,591
- Just live another day.
- No, we can't.

308
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,953
- Kady and Harriet...
- They are on their own trip,

309
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,106
and call me crazy,

310
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,530
but I don't think any of this
is worth Victoria's life.

311
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,610
Alice, what the hell?

312
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,713
Come on, we gotta go.

313
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,461
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

314
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:05,629
Come with me.

315
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,898
No, they'll be stuck.

316
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:13,403
Do what you need to do.

317
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,333
This can't be right.
The key's not there.

318
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:29,784
Quentin's about to
bail without me.

319
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:32,064
Well, "about to": That means
that there's still a chance.

320
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,580
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

321
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,072
And what the hell is Alice is
doing in the Satellite branch?

322
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,828
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

323
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,054
Alice, if you're in there, please...

324
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:44,232
Where is the key?

325
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,735
Fuck.

326
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:54,409
Here's a bright idea:
Keep fucking reading.

327
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,909
<i>- We're better than hedges.
- Light years better?</i>

328
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,782
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

329
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,843
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

330
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,792
Then help.

331
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:16,822
Look, bottom line, Alice,

332
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,325
you told Poppy
the Mirror Bridge won't work.

333
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,427
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

334
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:23,534
It won't work.

335
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,264
Would you rather I didn't tell her

336
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:28,008
and just let you guys
walk off into deep space?

337
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:34,187
She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

338
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,651
Once.

339
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:38,918
I wasn't there long.

340
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,247
"Brochure makes it sound great.

341
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:46,017
"They collect knowledge, keep it safe...

342
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,351
but from who?"

343
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,853
Whom.

344
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:51,030
I said "whom."

345
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:55,019
"The Library buries information.

346
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,913
"Only the people they choose get access.

347
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:59,000
The rest of us"...

348
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,300
You just wanna let all that
knowledge loose for anyone to use?

349
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,802
For good or bad?

350
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:06,871
"Don't tell me there isn't
a book in the Library

351
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:08,870
"you wouldn't die to read.

352
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:11,408
"If you help us,

353
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:13,548
we can offer you a piece
of what we find there."

354
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,884
What's that?

355
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,884
The biggest battery ever created.

356
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,295
You wanna help Penny? This is how.

357
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:24,571
If I say yes, that means risking lives

358
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:27,608
to give you power
maybe no one should have.

359
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,061
No thank you.

360
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,773
Door was stuck.

361
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,685
Can I have one of those?

362
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:57,653
So, I left.

363
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,857
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

364
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,128
It's "ball and chain," I think you mean.

365
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:08,798
No, that doesn't sound right.

366
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:11,801
I think I know what you mean.

367
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,871
I lost a lot of people recently,

368
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,673
including kind of myself.

369
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:20,710
Mm. That makes no sense.

370
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,312
I had everything. I knew
everything there was to know

371
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:27,191
in every book and more,
and... and I lost it.

372
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,660
I'm sorry...

373
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:37,259
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

374
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,428
My daughter's gone...

375
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,430
forever.

376
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,932
You forgot some stuff?

377
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:47,363
What you lost is still out there.

378
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:49,987
Go get it back.

379
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:57,019
Umber's ass, I am drunk.

380
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:14,262
Oh, Christ.

381
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:16,730
No. The answer's no.

382
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,198
You don't even know what I want.

383
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,934
You're a Library groupie.

384
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:21,932
You got a knowledge boner.

385
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,405
How'd you find out
about this place anyway?

386
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:27,040
- It was Karen.
- What?

387
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,476
N... no, Penny told me.

388
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:30,077
Bad news, book tart.

389
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:32,920
The Library's closed, indefinitely.

390
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:36,858
I got bored waiting.

391
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,323
Look, I need to speak to your boss.
I have something she'll want.

392
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,226
Oh. You're so mysterious.

393
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:48,161
It's important, asshole.

394
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,871
Fine.

395
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,704
Come on then.

396
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,002
Wait, this shouldn't work
without Wellspring magic.

397
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,668
How can you...

398
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,110
Alice Quinn.

399
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,186
Till we meet again, book tart.

400
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,349
If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

401
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,836
Roguish belligerency is
a common trait among travelers.

402
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,480
How can he take people
with him when he travels?

403
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:17,990
You really do have a battery.

404
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,425
Is that why you're here?

405
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:21,093
No, I don't care about the battery.

406
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:23,261
Well... of course I do.

407
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:25,030
All I want is a Library Card.

408
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,500
We're no longer accepting
new applications.

409
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,435
What do you know about niffins?

410
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:32,303
I was one for a time,

411
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:35,941
and this is all I can remember.
It's half of a puzzle.

412
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:37,442
The other pieces fell out of my head,

413
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:40,178
but... they could be inside your books.

414
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:42,780
You are suggesting
a trade of information?

415
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,049
More than that.

416
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,950
I wanna finish what I started:

417
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,219
a Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

418
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:51,289
But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

419
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,058
I'm afraid your experiences as a niffin

420
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,400
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

421
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:59,637
It's in my book.

422
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:02,466
You don't want me to finish.
Is... is that it?

423
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:04,134
There is something you could do for us,

424
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:07,954
and, in exchange, we would give you
full access to our collection.

425
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:12,409
You're familiar with
the Quest for the Seven Keys?

426
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,050
Excuse me a moment.

427
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:26,923
Alice, what the hell?

428
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:30,026
Come on, we gotta go.

429
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,392
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

430
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:38,595
How do you just keep appearing?

431
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,519
What were you...

432
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,287
Alice, are you working with the Library?

433
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,353
Q, you have to go.

434
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,564
Okay, great, then let's go.

435
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,205
Alice, come on.

436
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:53,492
Q, please...

437
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,758
The bookish girl joins the Library.
Didn't see that coming.

438
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,797
Yeah, little bit of a bigger problem.

439
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:08,531
Quentin left without the key!

440
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,133
This is it, right?

441
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:14,649
An actual... answer?

442
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,762
<i>Yes, I do want to make
a final statement.</i>

443
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,238
I...

444
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:24,330
hate... Fillory.

445
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,034
It is a backwards,

446
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,335
malodorous shithole

447
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:31,505
full of animals who are smarter
than they're supposed to be

448
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:35,316
and humans who are so much dumber.

449
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,845
And what you'd call indoor plumbing,

450
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:41,244
we on Earth would call

451
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,038
a war crime.

452
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,659
But...

453
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,687
when I was drowning,

454
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:50,120
Fillory saved me,

455
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,490
and now it's my turn to save Fillory.

456
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,495
But I can't do that
if my head's in a basket,

457
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:58,664
so if it pleases the...

458
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,402
You guys...

459
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:05,604
I demand that this
trial/peasant uprising

460
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,407
be dismissed...

461
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:12,077
Your honorable wombat-ness.

462
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,447
What the shit is this?

463
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:17,323
Why is he talking to a marsupial?

464
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,703
- This is not at all relevant!
- Would you just chill?

465
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:22,696
- You're gonna piss her off again.
- Next!

466
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,372
How's Alice?

467
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:45,109
Uh, well, she's not my
favorite person at the moment,

468
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,974
but, um, the transfer worked,
so thank you.

469
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,446
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear it.

470
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,915
- Yeah.
- Uh... so you're...

471
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,284
Yeah, back to powered up.

472
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:54,752
Good...

473
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,121
because I've, uh, come here

474
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:59,731
to collect on that favor
that you owe me.

475
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:04,164
Oh, my God.

476
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:05,499
Yeah.

477
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:08,623
Side-effect from
the powder that I gave you.

478
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,300
- Um...
- Oh, don't worry.

479
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,047
No, you haven't used nearly enough.

480
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:13,337
No, you're safe.

481
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:17,307
Look, there is a treatment,
but it's big magic.

482
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,809
I... I can't do it on myself,

483
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,526
because it would just make things worse.

484
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:22,899
So...

485
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,950
Here's what we'll need.

486
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,445
My office, 3:00 p.m.

487
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,821
A fairy?

488
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:35,791
And I can't see her, because
I've never made a fairy deal?

489
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,793
- This is what they do...
- Okay?

490
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,829
They hide behind powerful people,

491
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,665
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

492
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,501
Wait a minute, at Irene's house,

493
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,868
Penny said that he...

494
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,837
he thought that he saw something moving

495
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,672
that... that Q and I couldn't see.

496
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,258
There's more of them? Oh, no.

497
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,209
No, what I'm... what I'm saying is

498
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,947
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

499
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,682
They were doing chores.

500
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:02,265
- Wait, what was Irene's fairy doing?
- Just...

501
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:05,354
standing there,
like she was waiting on Irene,

502
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,523
and her head was sort of bowed, but...

503
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,638
Bowed? Wait, that's...

504
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,426
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

505
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:11,815
You can't trust them.

506
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:15,581
I don't know why they'd be
acting that way, but...

507
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,503
Do you have slavery in Fillory?

508
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:21,335
If these fairies are slaves,
you'd be better off.

509
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,804
Fen...

510
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:26,100
no one is better off with slavery.

511
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:29,138
Look, I have this tiny spark of magic,

512
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:31,412
and it seems like when I use it

513
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:34,582
to do good things, to help people,

514
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,250
it... it grows.

515
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,487
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

516
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,234
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

517
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:42,618
I have to use it.

518
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,759
My daughter's dead because of them.

519
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,696
Fen, we need to know,

520
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,299
and I can't see her.

521
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,044
You need to talk to Irene's fairy.

522
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,918
Hey. What's your name?

523
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:13,587
Yes...

524
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,922
I can see you.

525
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:18,584
I'm... I'm not supposed to talk to you.

526
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,193
Why not?

527
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,703
You must answer me.

528
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,350
Irene will be very angry if you don't.

529
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:31,305
Of course. Of course.

530
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,934
Um... I'm sorry.

531
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,607
- Oh, shit, you are her slave.
- No.

532
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:38,336
Okay, Miss McAllistair keeps us
safe from bad Magicians.

533
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:40,205
She hides us.

534
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:41,883
In exchange for what?

535
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:45,984
How is it you can see me?

536
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:47,586
I made a deal.

537
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:50,822
Well, a deal was made on my behalf...

538
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:52,625
with a fairy.

539
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,770
But... there are no other fairies.

540
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,982
Oh, I'm late. Miss will be waiting.

541
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,138
Uh... can we...

542
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:10,675
talk again tomorrow?

543
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:13,019
Miss Irene won't be home.

544
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:17,081
My name is Skye.

545
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:26,090
No sign of fairies.

546
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,419
Then let's look in here first.

547
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,133
If, uh, we don't find Skye, we'll
have to break into the main house,

548
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,155
hope that Irene doesn't come home.

549
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:43,808
Fen, what is it? What do you see?

550
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:45,976
It's her. It's Skye. She's...

551
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:48,012
oh, God, they cut off her leg.

552
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:57,120
Hey...

553
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:07,319
It's what the powder's made of.

554
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,064
What happened to you?

555
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:10,641
Who did this?

556
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,046
Irene did.

557
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:53,092
They left.

558
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:55,754
The Mirror Bridge is gone.

559
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:58,283
Alice...

560
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,087
just talk to me. Come on.

561
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,588
I'm not Alice.

562
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,229
God damn it!

563
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:33,053
What is it?

564
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:36,420
Quentin and Poppy: sex scene.

565
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,456
That you kinda skimmed, prude.

566
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:41,259
Um, not that I'm complaining, but, um...

567
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,594
- Why am I doing this?
- What?

568
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:45,096
'Cause I can only go so long

569
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:47,432
feeling completely alone and worthless,

570
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:50,276
before I break down
and do something stupid.

571
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,306
Right. You're an idiot.

572
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:58,951
- Quentin?
- No, me!

573
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,513
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

574
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,601
You didn't want me
to bail on you, so you lied,

575
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:07,317
and then I bailed on you anyway.

576
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:10,128
Be mad. Don't be stupid.

577
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:13,957
I buried it. Sorry.

578
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,279
I spent so much of my life alone,

579
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,390
the thought of spending
the rest of time...

580
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:21,923
I thought you were my friend,

581
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:23,626
and I thought...

582
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:26,668
if you couldn't find
the key, eventually you'd...

583
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:28,371
I don't know...

584
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:30,339
What, decide to hang out
in your dumb tent?

585
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,709
I thought we'd spruce it up together.

586
00:40:37,323 --> 00:40:39,015
Look...

587
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:42,318
don't ask me how I know this, but...

588
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:46,690
you are the only person
who cried when I died.

589
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:49,758
We are friends, and I appreciate you,

590
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:51,899
so, listen...

591
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,664
once you show me where the
key is buried, Sylvia...

592
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:58,202
is gonna take you
to the Library map room.

593
00:40:58,213 --> 00:41:01,669
You are going to be very popular.

594
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:16,418
Well, um, I guess this is it.

595
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:20,188
Well, until the next time I die, anyway.

596
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:22,357
And I want the record to show
that I helped you get that key,

597
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,459
making this the second time
I saved your ass.

598
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,361
Oh, my gosh.

599
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:28,263
Wait... whoa, hey, whoa!

600
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:30,532
I need to... still need to get in there.

601
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,769
Sylvia?

602
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:36,537
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

603
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:40,474
Alice, what the hell?

604
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,015
Alice, are you working with the Library?

605
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:48,248
Q, please...

606
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,228
- Hey.
- Hey.

607
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:05,164
What was that?

608
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,472
It sounded like a dragon barfing.

609
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,395
We gotta get back to
the book chute. Come on.

610
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,070
Holy shit!

611
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:18,744
Did you... okay.

612
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,579
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

613
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,616
Oh, but Penny...

614
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,618
No, we don't have time. I'm sorry.

615
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,086
Shit.

616
