The Tale of the Seven Keys.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,839
Jules, this is our quest.

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,936
Was there always a
keyhole right there?

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,040
The eye can never be fixed.

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,605
But you can't spy on me anymore.

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,708
You have a week's
sail back to Whitespire

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,412
to think about what you've done.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,783
Alice!

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,056
I'm sorry. You
called me too late.

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. He can't.

No, come on, Pen.
Don't, don't, come on.

(SOBS) No. Shit.

14

What the fuck is happening?

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,401
We have to do something.

16
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,471
Do something!

00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,940

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,744
Kady, he's gone.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,907
KADY: No.

20
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,822
Kady. Kady, I'm right...

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,165
You need to hear me.

Hey, I... What's wrong?

Oh, come on.

33
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,205
I'm sorry. Do you
ever have, like,

34
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,148
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't...

35
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,185
Um...

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,425
Why is nobody crying?

37
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,599
I saved all your
asses so many times.

38
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,833
Appreciate me!

39
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:29,241
Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

40
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,745
Yes?

41
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,417
QUENTIN: Okay, um, yeah.

42
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,221
We're here today

00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,889

William Penny Adi...

45
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,159
Adi, uh...

46
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,197
I don't really know how to
pronounce his last name.

47
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,537
It's Adiyodi. Idiot.

48
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,940
QUENTIN: Penny was complicated.

49
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,502
And I think he
probably hated me.

50
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,444
But, um...

51
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,045
None of us really knew him.

52
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,084
Not even me.

53
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,846
That's how he wanted it.

54
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,652
So, uh...

55
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,861
All I can really say is, uh...

56
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,439
I am so screwed.

No, no, no, no, no. I need that.

What's it been?

00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,891
Two weeks since we
caught the librarian?

72
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,497
Not much left but gristle.

73
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,032
You ate a librarian?

00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,904
Hi, there.

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,809
Eliot? Hello, kind strangers.

76
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,681
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

77
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,186
That's a bad move, Eliot.

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,915
What brought you
to the Neitherlands?

79
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,622

No, I mean...

81
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,922
We got here using magic beans.

82
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,893
We used a magic
key. ELIOT: Right.

83
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:59,455
But there's no magic
now, so, um, we're stuck.

84
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,328

sandwich or something...

00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,896
Thank you. PENNY:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,548
No, that's... Don't eat that.

96
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,220
No, don't eat that, please.

97
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,849
You're eating a dude!
Mmm. It's not bad.

Man, seriously, fuck this place!

99
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,588
I can't believe that he's gone.

100
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,025
I mean, we were
never really that close.

101
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,036
But I don't know, I...

102
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,533
I loved him, I think.

103
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,211
It's just... How come
you never really know

104
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,746
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

105
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,520
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

106
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,682
What?

107
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,189
I loved that.

108
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,351
Were you close with your dad?

109
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
Oh.

110
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,225
For fuck's sake.

111
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,399
QUENTIN: I saw
him a few weeks ago.

112
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,230
It's crazy. Um...

113
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,905
The cancer that
he had was sort of

114
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,071
inherently magical,

115
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,006
so magic went away, and...

116
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,742
He's, like, in remission.

117
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,950
Sorry. I didn't mean to, uh...

118
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,749
No, it's good. It's good.

119
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,119
It's the one good thing
to come out of this.

120
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,736
I didn't know when I
was gonna see you again.

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,228
I had nowhere else to go.

122
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,660
After the burial, I can't be in
the same room as my mom.

123
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,490
I mean, we could use your help.

124
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,629
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back...

125
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,330
Honestly, I don't
think we should.

126
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,999
Okay, I don't really know
where to begin with that.

127
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,169
But, I mean, for
starters, I mean,

128
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,769
this is... This is our quest.

129
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,246
I sort of feel like
we were elected.

130
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,943
It's magic. Jesus, Alice, I...

131
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,451
You turn it back on, what
happens to your dad?

132
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,655
(EXHALES) Sometimes
I want magic back

133
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,418
more than anything.

134
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,755
And sometimes I just...

135
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,025
I look around and see
what a mess we made with it.

136
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,632
Right now I just wanna be 23,

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,468
and not know what I want,

138
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,333
and not know what I'm doing.

139
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,496
Yeah.

140
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,370
Oh, God.

141
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,813
I just remembered,
I have to tell

142
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,477
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

143
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,779
How? Aren't they in Fillory?

144
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,650
(MOUTHING)

145
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,355
What are you doing?

146
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,971
That was super weird.

Majesty, if you would prefer,

148
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,071
we can put into harbor
at Broken Bay instead.

149
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,083
When did you get
this sweet boat?

150
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,684
Man.

151
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,021
I miss all the cool shit.

152
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,522
MARGO: We don't have a choice.

153
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,017
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

154
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,219
the Fairy Queen will fly in

155
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,057
on the back of some
whimsical animal,

156
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,754
and she'll slit our
throats, or worse.

157
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,659
A messenger bunny, Your Majesty.

158
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,171
Penny's dead. Sorry.

159
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,275
Penny's dead?

160
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,403
Was he not already?

161
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,908
What?

162
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,575
I can't believe it.
PENNY: Thank you.

163
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,784
Finally!

164
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,421
He was my best friend.

165
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,284
Okay, I mean, all right.

166
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,859
I guess I always thought

167
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,621
someday we were gonna bang.

168
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,861
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

169
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,395
You know, I... I thought
we'd have normal problems.

170
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,098
Like, I'd look at other
girls, and you'd get mad.

171
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,299
Or you'd tell me a
story for the third time,

172
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,400
and we'd realize we
have nothing left to say.

173
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,105
But we don't get
normal problems.

174
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,277
I know what you're
looking for. Don't.

175
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,213
This is stupid.

176
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,449
What do you think
this is gonna solve?

177
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,892
You can't hear a word I say.

178
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,129
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

179
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,328
if I can't do a damn
thing about it, so...

180
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,740
I'm gonna go.

181
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,437
Try and find some
way to fix this.

182
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,815
Goodbye, Kady.

183
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,318
Julia. (GASPS)

184
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,954
Help her. Now.

185
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,925
What? The hell?

186
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,191
You're the only one who can.

187
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,971
What? What happened?

188
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,771
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

189
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,876
Oh, fuck.

190
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,672
Jesus. Kady!

191
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,782
Kady, come on!

192
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,984
Um...

193
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,513
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

194
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,413
Kady...

195
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,984
Come on!

196
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,193
Come on. Please, Kady.

197
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,832
Wake up. (GASPS)

198
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,665
Okay. Okay.

199
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,532
Okay, baby.

200
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,834
Okay.

201
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,668
Holy shit, that was gross.

202
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,745
What?

203
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,977
You can see me?

204
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,080
You can see me?

205
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,690
Hey, what's your deal?
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.

206
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,996
It's just, you're talking to me,

207
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,258
and not through me,

208
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,391
and that's kind of huge, Penny.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,524
How do you know my name?

210
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,160
Well, I've been watching you

211
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,262
and your friends
since you got here.

212
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,105
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

213
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,876
Hyman? Mmm-hmm.

214
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,905
Did that mean something
different when you were born?

215
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,014
Wait, you haven't heard of me?

216
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:26,049
The Pervert Ghost of Brakebills?

217
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,053
I was a student
here in the 1920s.

218
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,522
A Traveler, like you.

219
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,722
I would practice astral
projection around the campus.

220
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,562
You know, pop into
lectures, the dormitories,

221
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,729
showers, you know how it is.

222
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,131
Uh... No. And as a prank,

223
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,896
someone moved
my body while I was...

224
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,098
Being a fucking pervert.

225
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:50,270
And, yes, in their defense, I
was given several warnings.

226
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,242
But I never found my body.

227
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,408
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

228
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,248
It must have died
without me in it.

229
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,754
That's a bummer.
Well, joke's on them.

230
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,050
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

231
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,058
So it's all peeping,
all the time.

232
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,618
You know you're
not a ghost, right?

233
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,124
Wha... I'm not?

234
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,630
You were on the astral
plane when you died.

235
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,759
So was I.

236
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,427
Our minds were traveling.

237
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,062
Now they have no
place to go back to.

238
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,471
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

239
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,305
so they relive their
death over and over.

240
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,673
Are you doing that?

241
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,313
People can see ghosts.

242
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,280
Ghosts can touch things.

243
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,785
I know, 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

244
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,979
and it wasn't great.

245
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,248
We can't do that.

246
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,313
Okay, Professor, then how come

247
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,721
I can sit in a chair?

248
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,590
Why am I not
just falling forever?

249
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,129
I don't know. I
don't make the rules.

250
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,664
Your ass just knows.

251
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,962
Look, didn't you
figure all this shit out

252
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,127
100 years ago when you died?

253
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,966
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

254
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:55,133
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive-ish?

255
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,370
Believe me, I tried everything.

256
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,873
For years.

257
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,807
It did not end well.
(DOOR OPENS)

258
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,192
What do you
mean, it didn't end...

259
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,878
Shh. Shut up.

260
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,213
Shut up.

261
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,978
JULIA: Hey. Hey.

262
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,148
How's Kady?

263
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,816
Sleeping it off
in the infirmary.

264
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,659
How did you know to
knock down her door?

265
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,663
Just a feeling. Okay.

266
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,358
They're my favorite pairing.

267
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,990
The tension between them.

268
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,662
Friends for years, but
he's always loved her.

269
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,501
You're in a bit of a
research K-Hole here.

270
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,404
Yeah. It's cool.

271
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,707
It just reminds me of me.

272
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,411
QUENTIN: So, the second
key... So, the knight's daughter,

273
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,505
she found it in a sentient cave

274
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,049
that just kept
asking her riddles,

275
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,694
and wouldn't let her in
until it deemed her worthy.

276
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,050
It was very patronizing. Wait.

277
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,485
Why does that sound familiar?

278
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,855
Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

279
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,224
in the first Fillory book,
<i>The World in the Walls.</i>

280
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,388
He was being chased by
a belligerent cassowary.

281
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,522
I remember. Right. Um...

282
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,693
So he finds this
mountain of treasure,

283
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,168
but only takes one item.

284
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,568
A golden key.

285
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,764
To bring to his friend.

286
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,397
Right, that he
met during the war.

287
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,703
So, look, if this story is real,

288
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,711
and he actually
did give him the key,

289
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,871
then I... I...

290
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,438
Jules, I think the
key is here on Earth.

291
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,873
(CHUCKLES)

292
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,384
Seriously?

293
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,611
These two?

294
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,416
You and Kady are great.

295
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,957
I totally ship that.

296
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,888
Alice is okay.

297
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,619
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

298
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,561
You know? I don't
get that reference.

299
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,265
Oh, Josh is my idol.

300
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,627
That man is a Vagician.

301
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,762
But Quentin, I mean,

302
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,707
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

303
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,907
As someone born in 1902,

304
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,944
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

305
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:48,421
Anyway, Quentin
is the duck's nuts.

306
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,617
No, that cannot be a
real thing people said.

307
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,420
So we should send
a message to Eliot.

308
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,325
Shit. Eliot.

309
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,759
Oh, my God.

310
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,429
(PANTING)

311
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,802
Cannibals! They're cannibals!

312
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,131
I told you!

313
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Oh, my God.

314
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,239
They made me

315
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,805
eat a person.

316
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,602
We should make a deal with them.

317
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,772
No.

318
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,941
You can't negotiate
with cannibals.

319
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,484
You can't give
them what they want.

320
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,986
Well, can't we? No!

321
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,484
You're grounded.

322
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,282
We need to find
a way out of here.

323
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,668
On the <i>Muntjac,</i> the
key created the door

324
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,160
out of nowhere
when we needed it.

325
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,287
I don't see any doors or
places a door could be.

326
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,592
Downstairs in the Library!

327
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,524
You lied about the key.

328
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,996
They lied first.

329
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,646
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

330
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,536
No, you lied to me.

331
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,172
You were never collecting taxes.

332
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,119
Uh, can we have this talk
when we're not being hunted

333
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,009
by cannibals?
What is the key for?

334
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,876
Fray! What does it really do?

335
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,176
It doesn't fucking matter
if we can't find a door.

336
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,452
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

337
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,714
No shit!

338
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,999
I think, there are cannibals
sitting on the only entry point.

339
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,150
Wait, they're coming!

340
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,022
Run, run, run!

341
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,658
Slow down! I have wooden toes!

342
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,889
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

343
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,829
Hyman, where have you been?

344
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,213
I went with them
to solve the mystery

345
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,865
of Rupert's golden key.

346
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,405
Who cares?

347
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,237
If they find all
seven keys, Penny,

348
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,367
then...

349
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,908
Something good happens?

350
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,573
I missed a bit.

351
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,706
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

352
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,341
So the seven keys

353
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,217
from the story unlock magic?

354
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,516
Oh, that's...

355
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,081
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

356
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:36,094
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

357
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,229
in World War II.

358
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,594
His name was Lance Morrison.

359
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,395
And it turns out
that after the war,

360
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,528
Lance went to a magic school.

361
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,038
Brakebills. JULIA: Right.

362
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,269
So if there are any
records from the late 1940s,

363
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,541
maybe that can
help us find the key.

364
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,103
My assistant's file
cabinet, bottom drawer.

365
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,442
Thank you.

366
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,444
Pardon the interruption.
Can I help you?

367
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,181
Wait a minute. I know that guy.

368
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,450
I certainly hope you can.

369
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,081
I'm here on behalf of The Order.

370
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,127
At the Library formerly
headquartered in the Neitherlands?

371
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,563
We need to talk about Penny.

372
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,698
Sorry to be blunt,

373
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,864
but did Penny die
a traumatic death?

374
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,042
Dean Fogg said you
were the one to ask.

375
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,306
Yes, it was traumatic.

376
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,340
That explains it.

377
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,410
Penny signed a
contract with The Order,

378
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,477
guaranteeing his
services in this life

379
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,146
and, well, beyond.

380
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,314
Curiously, his soul
never reported for service

381
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,449
to our Underworld branch.

382
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Then where is he?

383
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,061
I'm right here.

384
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,828
Likely in the process of
becoming a vengeful spirit.

385
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,125
Best to nip that in the
bud before his time is up.

386
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,293
What do you mean?

387
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,546
The soul is tethered to the body

388
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,061
for seven days after death.

389
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,335
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

390
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,773
and send him on his way.

391
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,835
How? Eat him, naturally.

392
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,947
(CHUCKLES) Sweetheart,
I'm not gonna eat him.

393
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,278
I'm a pescatarian.

394
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,228
The Order has retained
the services of a corpse eater

395
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,618
for situations such as this.

396
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,282
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no
one is eating my body, okay?

397
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,636
I'm not fucking
done with it yet.

398
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,250
Kind of a ticking clock on this.

399
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,352
If the tether goes before
Penny's soul passes on,

400
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,622
he's right fucked.

401
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,289
The corpse eater
needs a tick to prepare.

402
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,858
She'll be here
tomorrow at sundown.

403
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,195
Oh, and you're welcome.

404
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,580
The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

405
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,342
But Penny still has his tether.

406
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,814
I'm not a ghost!

407
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,514
KADY: If he's a
ghost, shouldn't he be,

408
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,014
I don't... I don't
know, haunting us?

409
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,802
What if something else happened?

410
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,988
Yes, something else did happen!

411
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,826
ALICE: It can take decades
for a spirit to become malevolent.

412
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,565
Corpse eaters
are a rare creature.

413
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,659
If the Librarians
actually have one,

414
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,968
not just some sicko
who wants a free meal,

415
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,007
you should use it.

416
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,537
But what if there's
a way to fix him?

417
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,806
To bring him back?

418
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,541
ALICE: Without magic?

419
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,344
Julia has magic.

420
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,910
Okay, not much, but I...

421
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,316
It's just, I... I... I can't
wrap my head around

422
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,554
sending him to work for
the Library for a billion years.

423
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,588
I don't trust them.

424
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,561
There you go. Come on, Kady.

425
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,223
The Underworld's not so bad.

426
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,626
Quentin says there's
a bowling alley.

427
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,863
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

428
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,198
PENNY: Damn it, Alice.

429
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,897
I thought we were bros.

430
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,034
Ah. Let go, let go, let go!

431
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,840
My God!

432
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,945
I was only trying
to follow the story.

433
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,712
No, what Julia does
in the bath is not story!

434
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,619
It is revealing of character.

435
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,090
Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

436
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,919
Okay?

437
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,621
Now, I don't give a
shit if it didn't end well

438
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,028
for you in the past. You
are going to help me.

439
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,861
Or I will cock block
you for the rest of time.

440
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,934
Okay.

441
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,073
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

442
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,979
I spent months
trying to push things.

443
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,443
I never got anywhere.

444
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,745
Until I tried being the thing.

445
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,649
Uh...

446
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,985
(EXHALES)

447
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,756
Okay, focus on a penny.

448
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,386
(LAUGHS)

449
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,664
Get it? 'Cause of
your name? You get it.

450
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,661
Now, you're not gonna
try to move the penny.

451
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,400
You're gonna try to be it.

452
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,264
So pour yourself into its shape.

453
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,165
Inhabit it with
your whole being.

454
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,803
Hmm?

455
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,173
Go ahead.

456
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,908
Be the penny. Okay.

457
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,680
I got this.

458
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,611
Be the penny.

459
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,783
<i>Just be the goddamn penny!</i>

460
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,931
Penny, just be it! (STUTTERS)

461
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,321
What does that even mean?

462
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,585
You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

463
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,136
Maybe we should have
started with a nickel.

464
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,152
Wha... Huh? Be the nickel!

465
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,424
Maybe you shouldn't
say the same dumb shit

466
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,898
over and over!

467
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,662
Oh, I'm sorry, but
you're a dullard!

468
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,700
A real dunce, I say!

469
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,373
You are worth less than a penny,

470
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,964
and a penny is worthless!

471
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,041
(SCREAMS)

472
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,278
Um...

473
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,041
PENNY: This is weird.

474
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,379
(GASPS) You are the penny.

475
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,313
What do I do now? I can't move.

476
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,287
Well, how could you?
You don't have any feet.

477
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,287
(PENNY GRUNTS)

478
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,025
What are you...
What are you doing?

479
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,326
It sounds like you're pooping.

480
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,689
Holy zerts! You
did it! (CHUCKLES)

481
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,466
(GAGGING) Oh.

482
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,133
I still have the taste of
pennies in my mouth.

483
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,004
Wait, why... Why don't I...

484
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,345
Why don't I just project
myself into my own body?

485
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,675
I know how to be that.

486
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,340
The only reason
you're still alive

487
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,941
is because you were astral
projecting when you died.

488
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,414
So if you go back
into your corpse,

489
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,887
you'll just be dead.

490
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,157
I need something bigger.

491
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,555
I need something that can talk.

492
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,523
Yeah, hey, be careful.

493
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,428
Controlling things with
brains is much harder.

494
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,433
PENNY: Be the bunny.

495
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,963
(EXHALES) Be the bunny.

496
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,702
Be the bunny.
MARGO: It won't work.

497
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,338
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

498
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,873
with a few days' time
out on Eliot's party boat?

499
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,921
Your Majesty, upon
our return to Whitespire,

500
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:39,516
might I suggest a hot
bath to relax yourself?

501
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:44,223
I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

502
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,059
I keep waiting for
Eliot to come back.

503
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,993
But maybe he never will.

504
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,270
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

505
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,966
For all I know, he's dead.

506
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,078
And him and Penny are
blowing each other in Heaven.

507
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,479
Now, when I get back...

508
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,252
I'm gonna fix this.

509
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,416
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

510
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,391
Tick, you're gonna go to
that fairy-repelling hallway

511
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,261
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

512
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,028
You're gonna put it in
the Fairy Queen's bath

513
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,631
and when that
knocks her on her ass,

514
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,430
I'm gonna cut out
her heart and eat it

515
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,739
in front of every goddamn
fairy asshole in the kingdom.

516

Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

Since Margo's been
gone, I've been storing it.

You know, for safekeeping?

526
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,619
Ew. That's problematic.

TODD: It's not like that.

528
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,859
I just dress her up and
pretend she respects me.

commission since magic died,

00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,348
(BOTH YELLING)

537
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,210
I told you it wouldn't end well.

538
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,756
You know, I wish
you weren't dead

539
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,694
so I could kill you.

540
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,499
DEAN: <i>So, this
Margolem must've had</i>

541
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,302
some residual magic left in her.

542
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,377
Or the living clay she was
made of was a magical creature?

543
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,288
Uh, anyway, while
we have you here,

544
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,611
we found Lance
Morrison's Brakebill records.

545
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,775
Um... It says that he was
only a student for a semester.

546
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,213
But it also says in
this file that he left

547
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,515
because of a "code seven."

548
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:23,954
Student suicide.

549
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,888
Or he magically exploded.

550
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,120
I don't know why they use
the same damn code for both.

551
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,393
Okay, either way,
he died on campus.

552
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,295
So the key might
still be here, right?

553
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,909
But it says he was
living in the West Dorm,

554
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,213
and there is no
such thing, so...

555
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,348
That's because it's buried.

556
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,428
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

557
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,562
DEAN: In the late 1940s,

558
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,108
there was a haunting
in the West Dorm.

559
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,040
At the time, it was
considered bad form

560
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,806
to have a ghost on campus.

561
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,410
Unlike today, where we put
it in the goddamn brochure.

562
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,452
"That ghost" is gonna kill them.

563
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,117
To death, Penny.

564
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,212
So, the Dean buried
the whole dorm.

565
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,087
Magically protected
the entrances

566
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,468
so that students
couldn't find it.

567
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,724
But magic is gone.
So we can walk right in.

568
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,897
Right?

569
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,091
What are you gonna do?

570
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,259
Nothing.

571
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,262
It's not my problem.

572
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,770
They're your friends.
Who I can't help in any way.

573
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,431
You go figure some shit out.

574
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,642
(SCOFFS) I'm not
going down there.

575
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,467
What are you scared of?

576
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,637
You're dead already.

577
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,179
You're so dumb, Penny.

578
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,684
Ghosts can hurt
whatever it is we are.

579
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,651
That one in the West dorm?

580
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,019
Terrorized me for a week.

581
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,451
Wait a minute.

582
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,753
If they can hurt us, then...
Then they can see us.

583
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,809
Hey. Q.

584
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:03,849
(DOOR CREAKS)

585
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:08,893
All right.

586
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,996
Um... Excuse me.

587
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,595
Lance Morrison?

588
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,905
Who are you?

589
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,500
Did my father send you?

590
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,668
You can tell him I am not
coming home for winter.

591
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,075
PENNY: Hey, ghost boy.

592
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,737
We need to talk.

593
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,185
You need to tell them that
Penny is in the room with them.

594
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,984
What are you talking about?

595
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,015
No, I am not a bitch!

596
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,060
Well, we don't think
that. Right, no, of course.

597
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,062
Do you know anything
about a golden key

598
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,190
that maybe your friend
Rupert Chatwin gave you?

599
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,626
Rupert?

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

601
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,031
This place is quite something.

602
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,037
Nothing compared
to where you've been.

603
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,905
He's in a ghost loop.

604
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,089
He's not even listening to us.

605
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,604
I brought you something.

606
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,110
From Fillory. Here.

607
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,616
Take it.

608
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,280
It won't hurt.

609
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,414
It just reveals the
honest truth of things.

610
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,756
Shows them as they truly are.

611
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,232
I see.

612
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,567
(CHUCKLES) Damn it, Hyman.

613
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,374
This isn't terrifying. It's
just two dudes kissing.

617

about your mother's family.

618
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,419
You have sullied
the McAllistair name.

LANCE: All I did
was tell the truth.

620
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,320
Truth can bury us.

621
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,429
It's the key.

622
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,126
It's ruined everything.

623
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,474
Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt
this little father-son moment,

624
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,062
but could someone
please just say the words,

625
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,505
"Penny is in the room"?

626
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,134
Say it isn't true. Okay.

627
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,772
You can't control yourself.

628

Don't blame the key
for your perversion.

637
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,641
You will say my name.

638
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,810
You say my name, you ghost dick!

639
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,285
What is your name?

640
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,287
That's not a name!

641
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,448
No, it isn't!

642
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,752
No, it isn't!

00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:53,985
Uh, Q?

644
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,988
I think we might
have broken this ride.

645
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,291
No!

The Library has a corpse eater

00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,175
that can help take
him to the Underworld.

649
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,181

Oh, hell no.

00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,883
Then he'll be stuck
there for eternity,

654
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,850
turning into a ghost, or worse.

655
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,705

"Better than a slave

"to the people who killed him.

"For a billion years."

Am I the only one
that knows that eternity

659
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,859
is a lot longer
than a billion years?

(GROANS)

661
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,766
Lance said his mom
was a McAllistair.

662
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,503
Well, that would explain
how he got into Brakebills.

663
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,842
The McAllistairs are
on the board of trustees.

664
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,906
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

665
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,211
Lance's father held the key.

666
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,946
I mean, he knew
how powerful it was.

667
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,247
That it would reveal truth.

668
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,346
It would show things
that were hidden.

669
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,913
So, he would have kept it.

670
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,755
Except that he would
have died by now, so...

671
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,624
Wait, could you get
us into that house?

672
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,192
Maybe.

give her something

the power to reveal things

she is either gonna
burn my corpse,

it to the Library.

did on that island.

We scare away the bad
men, we get to a book chute,

693
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,107
we find a door, and
we get the hell out.

00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,306
Okay. Okay.

you haven't worked
a day in your life.

707
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,173
It's just an illusion.

708
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,445

I wish I could help.

715
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,460
Henry. DEAN: How are you?

716
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,628
(CHUCKLES)

717
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,729
It is so good to see you!

718
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,067
I was so happy when you called.

719
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,871
Yeah. Irene, these
are my students.

720
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,468
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

721
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,706
Come on in.

722
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,487
Okay, there's some
real <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

723
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,025
kind of stuff happening here.

724
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,584
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

725
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,425
Well, the house's
enchantments run

726
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,490
on a reserve of energy that
my father built up over decades.

727
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,002
When he was a child,
there was a blackout

728
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,436
that lasted for months.

729
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,198
So he wanted to be prepared.

730
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,270
Please, come. Follow me.

731
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,309
Unfortunately, they won't last.

732
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,440
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

733
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,574
Which is why I was so
intrigued by your call, Henry.

734
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,614
Would you like a martini?

735
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,083
Martini! (ICE CUBES RATTLE)

736
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,590
Can I get an olive
in mine, please?

737
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,728
Thank you.

738
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,230
Thank you.

739
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,304
So, which one of
you can do magic?

740
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,573
Um...

741
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,981
Well, I, um...

742
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,977
So, before I knew
about magic, real magic,

743
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,750
I... I used to do a lot
of sleight of hand tricks.

744
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:24,091
So, it turns out that I
wasn't very good at it.

745
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:29,594
I was cheating, by
using translocation spells

746
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,136
without really knowing it.

747
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,965
I don't know why, but,
um, those tricks still work.

748
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,275
Or you have a squished
olive in your pocket.

749
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,811
(CHUCKLES)

750
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,078
Fascinating.

751
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,115
Not at all useful, but, uh...

752
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,314
I can do more.

753
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,448
Um... Do you have
a deck of cards?

754
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,655
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, excuse me.

755
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,327
Where's your restroom?

756
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,647
Holy shit.

757
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,473
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

758
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,659
I'm sorry, Penny.

759
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,891
It's been six and a half days.

760
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,834
Time's up.

761
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,715
Come on.

762
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,026
Come on, find it!

763
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,198
Come on!

764
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,563
Damn it.

765
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,112
PENNY: Kady, wait.

766
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,548
I just need more time.

767
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,291
ALICE: It's not too late.

768
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,954
Corpse eater will
be here any minute.

769
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,226
Honestly, why do you care?

770
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,998
He was my friend.

771
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,393
He wasn't one of you.

772
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,069
You're right. I
barely knew Penny.

773
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,947
I don't know where he was from,

774
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,443
I don't know about his family,

775
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,674
I don't know... I don't
know how he found magic.

776
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,617
But I know what
it's like to be trapped

777
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,351
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

778
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,126
But in the Underworld,

779
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,018
he still gets to be Penny.

780
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,790
Dammit, Alice, I'm still me.

781
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:50,325
It took everything I had

782
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,664
to try to save his life.

783
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,038
And then

784
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,805
he died anyway.

785
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,873
And then, I... And
then I was relieved.

786
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,641
To be done.

787
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,821
If Penny was here...

788
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,491
If he could tell us
what he wanted...

789
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,356
But he's not.

790
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay, look, they're
both terrible options,

791
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,657
but if I had to choose,

792
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,632
please don't send
me to the Underworld.

793
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,673
I know you don't
want the responsibility.

794
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,837
So don't take it.

795
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,736
Let me.

796
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,214
No, Kady, please.

797
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,187
Be the candle.

798
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,519
Be the candle.

799
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,085
I'll go get the corpse eater.

800
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,068
Penny...

801
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,714
That's uncomfortable to hold.

802
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,712
It makes me feel like...

803
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,991
I don't know, like
I'm not really myself.

804
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,525
Okay, then I will

805
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,896
pass on touching it.

806
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,225
Oh, uh... I checked the book.

807
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,962
So, you unlocked chapter three.

808
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:38,237
Um... And it looks
like the... The next key

809
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,242
might be in Fillory, maybe.

810
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,540
(DOOR OPENS) Um...

811
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,274
(CLEARS THROAT)

812
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,416
Dean Fogg.

813
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,712
Good morning.

814
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,253
Yeah. It is the morning.

815
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,614
Irene sent her apologies.

816
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,650
Our little show did not
convince her last night.

817
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:56,827
We're out of time.

818
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,419
As of this morning,

819
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,022
the board of directors
put Brakebills up for sale.

820
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,794
The school will be closed.

821
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,130
I'm out of a job.

822
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,094
And I'd say you're evicted,

823
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,164
but I have no idea who
actually owns this building.

824
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,606
Quentin, is this scotch or rye?

825
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,306
Rum. Excellent.

826
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,278
Well, carry on.

827
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,287
I'm going to go lie down.

828
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,117
Well, look at it this way.

829
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,792
Now we've both been
kicked out of Brakebills, so...

830
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,591
We've got that in common.

831
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,600
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

832
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,765
Holy shit. (BREATHES HEAVILY)

833
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,801
(SIGHS)

834
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,206
Thank Christ. Eliot?

835
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,944
Hey. How did you...

836
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,309
Hey.

837
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,810
ELIOT: Can I please
have some water?

838
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,185
Yeah, sure. Sparkling, please.

839
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,658
Gather 'round.

840
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,864
Story time with Uncle Eliot.

841
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,262
This story is called,

842
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:17,638
"Eliot did nothing wrong
but was chased by cannibals

843
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,110
"through the befucked
Neitherlands anyway."

844
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,372
Sorry, who's this?

845
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,880
Oh, right, yeah. Meet Fray.

846
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,177
Our daughter.

847
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,047
I'm sorr... Your...
Wait, your daughter?

848
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,713
Please, hold your
questions till the end.

849
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,990
So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

850
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,558
Naturally, I resolved
to use the key,

851
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,927
which, in Fillory,
created illusions

852
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,522
of a terrifying monster.

853
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,897
He made his father instead.

854
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,759
No spoilers.

855
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,170
But, yeah. What she said.

856
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,104
Turns out the key
creates illusions

857
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,368
of what you most fear.

858
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,670
Hence...

859
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,241
My dad.

860
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,510
I told my father that
the guys in the tent

861
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,709
didn't know the difference
between a tractor

862
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,944
and a backhoe.

863
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,217
So he went to set them straight.

864
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,280
You saying you...
You fed your...

865
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,115
Your dad to cannibals?

866
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,859
An illusion of him. But, yes.

867
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,027
It was very cathartic.

868
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,299
There was lots of
screaming on both sides.

869
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,627
But we snuck right past them.

870
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,264
We found a key, too. Uh...

871
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,112
We've been... We've
been calling it the truth key

872
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,111
'cause it... Well,
it reveals truths.

873
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,148
JULIA: Truths. I can
handle a little truth.

874
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,116
I don't know.

875
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,656
I don't see anything.

876
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,248
Maybe it doesn't work on me.

877
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:42,993
Oh, hey, Penny.

878
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,318
Wait.
