1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:01,585
Previously on The Magicians...

2
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:03,106
Q, I think this is it.

3
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:04,307
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

4
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:06,206
Jules, this is our quest.

5
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,952
Was there always a keyhole right there?

6
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:12,315
The eye can never be fixed.

7
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:14,484
But you can't spy on me anymore.

8
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,553
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

9
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,120
to think about what you've done.

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,656
Alice!

11
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:27,329
I'm sorry. You called me too late.

12
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,465
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He can't.

13
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,634
No, come on, Pen. Don't, don't, come on.

14
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:36,505
Oh, no. Shit.

15
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:41,377
What the... is happening?

16
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,479
We have to do something.

17
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,347
Do something!

18
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:46,648
Kady.

19
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,650
Kady, he's gone.

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,721
No.

21
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:56,825
K... Kady. Kady, I'm right...

22
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:05,500
You need to hear me.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,368
I was astral projecting.

24
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:10,438
I wasn't in my body when I died...
it died.

25
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,506
Damn it!

26
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,513
Damn it.

27
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,749
Damn it!

28
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,754
Q. Hey.

29
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:30,424
Hey, I, uh... What's wrong?

30
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:35,191
Um... it's... It's Penny.

31
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:49,143
Oh, come on.

32
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,480
I'm sorry. Do you ever have, like,

33
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,716
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't...

34
00:01:56,726 --> 00:02:04,724
Um...

35
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,427
Why is nobody crying?

36
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:14,634
I saved all your asses so many times.

37
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:17,034
Appreciate me!

38
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,581
Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

39
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:33,585
Yes?

40
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,487
Okay, um, yeah.

41
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:38,924
We're here today to remember the life

42
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:42,761
of a friend and student.

43
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:46,264
Uh, William Penny Adi...

44
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:48,933
Adi... Uh...

45
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:51,010
I don't really know how to
pronounce his last name.

46
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,521
It's Adiyodi. Idiot.

47
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:54,877
Penny was complicated.

48
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:58,776
And I... I, uh, think
he probably hated me.

49
00:02:58,786 --> 00:03:02,546
But, um...

50
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,548
None of us really knew him.

51
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:05,883
Not even me.

52
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,186
That's how he wanted it.

53
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:11,189
So, uh...

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,175
All I can really say is, uh...

55
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,536
I am so screwed.

56
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:37,596
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

57
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:57,533
Okay, come on.

58
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,034
Damn it.

59
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:06,936
Yo.

60
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:09,544
Bodi, you down there?

61
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:10,946
Shep!

62
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:13,198
I found one of them soft ones you like.

63
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,331
Don't burn it.

64
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:18,287
Oh, the vellum feels nice on my ass.

65
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:20,555
No, no, no, no, no. I need that.

66
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,291
I got a surprise for you, too.

67
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,005
Fresh meat upstairs.

68
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,033
What's it been?

69
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,591
Two weeks since we caught the Librarian?

70
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,364
Not much left but gristle.

71
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:37,173
You ate a Librarian?

72
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,341
Hi, there.

73
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,677
- Eliot?
- Hello, kind strangers.

74
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,779
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

75
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,648
That's a bad move, Eliot.

76
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:48,183
What brought you to the Neitherlands?

77
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:50,051
Family vacation.

78
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,353
No, I mean...

79
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:53,188
We got here using magic beans.

80
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:55,041
- We used a magic key.
- Right.

81
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:58,846
But there's no magic now, so, um...
so we're stuck.

82
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:00,949
- Like you?
- That's right.

83
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,731
Fountains are all frozen over.

84
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,065
We haven't eaten in days.

85
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,034
Right, um...

86
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:09,137
If you had a... an extra
sandwich or something...

87
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:11,472
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

88
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,174
- Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

89
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:16,009
No, no, no. No, Eliot, don't!
They're cannibals!

90
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,238
Oh, God.

91
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,079
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

92
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,048
No, that's... don't eat that.

93
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,683
No, don't eat that, please.

94
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:24,833
You're eating a dude! Mmm, it's not bad.

95
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:28,044
Oh, man, seriously, this place!

96
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,192
I can't believe that he's gone.

97
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:34,261
I mean, we were never really that close.

98
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,364
But I don't know, I...

99
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:39,997
I loved him, I think.

100
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:43,334
It's just... how come
you never really know

101
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:46,098
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

102
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,260
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

103
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,628
Hmm. What?

104
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,411
I loved that.

105
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,867
Were you close with your dad?

106
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:02,936
Oh... For... sake.

107
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,971
I saw him a few weeks ago.

108
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,640
It's crazy.

109
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,710
Um... the cancer that he had

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,879
was sort of... inherently magical,

111
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,313
so magic went away, and...

112
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:18,391
He's, like, in remission.

113
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:22,515
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um...

114
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,585
No, it's good. It's good.

115
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:28,462
it's the one good thing
to come out of this.

116
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,492
I didn't know when I was
gonna see you again.

117
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,460
I had nowhere else to go.

118
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,597
After the burial, I can't be
in the same room as my mom.

119
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,266
I mean, we could use your help.

120
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,468
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back...

121
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,892
Honestly, I don't think we should.

122
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,920
Okay, I don't really know
where to begin with that.

123
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,809
But, I mean, for starters, I mean,

124
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,611
this is... this is our quest.

125
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,227
I sort of feel like we were elected.

126
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,883
It's magic. Jesus, Alice, I...

127
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:58,283
You turn it back on, what
happens to your dad?

128
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:03,522
Sometimes I want magic
back more than anything.

129
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:05,725
And sometimes I just...

130
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:09,794
I look around and... and see
what a mess we made with it.

131
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,531
Right now I just wanna be 23,

132
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,432
and not know what I want, and
not know what I'm doing.

133
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,846
Yeah.

134
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,193
Oh, God.

135
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:29,647
I just remembered, I have to tell.

136
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,315
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

137
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,685
How? Aren't they in Fillory?

138
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,002
What are you doing?

139
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,573
That was super weird.

140
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,541
Your Majesty, if you would prefer,

141
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:01,002
we can put into harbor at,
uh, Broken Bay instead.

142
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,846
When did you get this sweet boat?

143
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,882
Man.

144
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,826
I miss all the cool shit.

145
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,685
We don't have a choice.

146
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,620
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

147
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,007
the Fairy Queen will fly in on the
back of some whimsical animal,

148
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,836
and she'll slit our throats, or worse.

149
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,011
A messenger bunny, Your Majesty.

150
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:28,111
Penny's dead. Sorry.

151
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,080
Penny's dead?

152
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,415
Was he not already?

153
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:33,549
What?

154
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,785
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

155
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:38,888
finally!

156
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,890
He was my best friend.

157
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,093
Okay, I mean, all right.

158
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:47,304
I guess I always thought
someday we were gonna bang.

159
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:50,766
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

160
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,405
You know, I... I thought
we'd have normal problems.

161
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,000
Like, I'd look at other
girls, and you'd get mad.

162
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:00,175
Or you'd tell me a story
for the third time,

163
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,461
and we'd realize we have
nothing left to say.

164
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,339
But we don't get normal problems.

165
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:10,295
I know what you're looking for. Don't.

166
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,631
This is stupid.

167
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,725
What do you think this is gonna solve?

168
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:23,353
You can't hear a word I say.

169
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,767
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

170
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:29,815
if I can't do a damn
thing about it, so...

171
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,728
I'm gonna go.

172
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,798
Try and find some way to fix this.

173
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:42,656
Goodbye, Kady.

174
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,388
Julia.

175
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:53,224
Help her. Now.

176
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:54,976
- What?
- The hell?

177
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:57,379
You're the only one who can.

178
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,812
What? What... what happened?

179
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:14,488
- Jesus.
- Kady!

180
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,909
- Kady, come on!
- Um...

181
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:22,051
Kady...

182
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:24,388
Come on!

183
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:31,481
Come on. Please, Kady.

184
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,215
Wake up.

185
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,654
Okay. Okay.

186
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,293
Okay, baby.

187
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,129
Okay.

188
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,653
Holy shit, that was gross.

189
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:46,059
What?

190
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,520
You... you can see me?

191
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,067
You can see me?

192
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,102
Hey, what's your deal?

193
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:59,024
Sorry.

194
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,973
It's just, you're talking to me,

195
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:04,176
and not through me, and that's...
that's kind of huge, Penny.

196
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:05,343
How do you know my name?

197
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:09,313
Well, I've been watching you and
your friends since you got here.

198
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,915
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

199
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,252
- Hyman?
- Mmm-hmm.

200
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:17,021
Did that mean something
different when you were born?

201
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,257
Wait, you... you haven't heard of me?

202
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:23,695
The Pervert Ghost of Brakebills?

203
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:26,217
I was a student here in the 1920s.

204
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,699
A Traveler, like you.

205
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,038
I would practice Astral
Projection around the campus.

206
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,370
You know, pop into
lectures, the dormitories,

207
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,640
uh, showers, you know how it is.

208
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,042
- Uh, no.
- And as a prank,

209
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,712
someone moved my body while I was...

210
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:43,114
Being a... pervert.

211
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:47,050
And, yes, in their defense, I
was given several warnings.

212
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,220
But I never found my body.

213
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,657
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

214
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,026
it must have died without me in it.

215
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,395
- That's a bummer.
- Well, joke's on them.

216
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,030
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

217
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,162
So it's all peeping, all the time.

218
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,637
You know you're not a ghost, right?

219
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:08,071
Wha... I'm not?

220
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,687
You were on the Astral
Plane when you died.

221
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:11,804
So was I.

222
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,507
Our minds were traveling.

223
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:16,079
Now they have no place to go back to.

224
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,445
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

225
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:21,476
so they relive their
death over and over.

226
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,050
Are you doing that?

227
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,155
People can see ghosts.

228
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:27,056
Ghosts can touch things.

229
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,359
I know, 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

230
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:32,028
and it wasn't great. We can't do that.

231
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:35,731
Okay, Professor, then how
come I can sit in a chair?

232
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:38,652
Why... why am I not
just falling forever?

233
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:41,671
I don't know. I don't make the rules.
Your ass just knows.

234
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,773
Look, didn't you... didn't
you figure all this shit out

235
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,108
100 years ago when you died?

236
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,123
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

237
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,113
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive... ish?

238
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,283
Believe me, I tried everything.

239
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,251
For years.

240
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,036
It did not end well.

241
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,790
- What do you mean, it didn't end...
- Shh. Shut up.

242
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,692
Shut up.

243
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,760
- Hey.
- Hey.

244
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,128
How's Kady?

245
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:09,064
Sleeping it off in the infirmary.

246
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:12,073
How did you know to knock down her door?

247
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,435
- Just a feeling.
- Okay.

248
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,137
They're my favorite pairing.

249
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,139
The... the tension between them.

250
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,660
Friends for years, but
he's always loved her.

251
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,277
You're in a bit of a
research K-Hole here, huh?

252
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,213
- Mm, yeah.
- It's cool.

253
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:28,115
It just reminds me of me.

254
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,478
So, the second key... So,
the knight's daughter,

255
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:32,728
she found it in a sentient cave

256
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,145
that just kept asking her riddles,

257
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:36,212
and wouldn't let her in
until it deemed her worthy.

258
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:38,258
- It was very patronizing.
- Wait. Why does that sound familiar?

259
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,830
Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

260
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,289
in the first Fillory book,
"The World in the Walls."

261
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,429
He was being chased by a
belligerent cassowary.

262
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,031
- I remember.
- Right.

263
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:52,472
Um, so he finds this
mountain of treasure,

264
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,549
uh, but only takes one item.

265
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,854
A golden key.

266
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:58,455
- To bring to his friend.
- Right, that he met during the war.

267
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:00,480
So, look, if this story is real,

268
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,850
and he actually did give him
the key, then I... I...

269
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,487
Jules, I think the key is here on Earth.

270
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,756
Seriously?

271
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,191
These two?

272
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,193
You and Kady are great.

273
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,095
I totally ship that.

274
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,097
Alice is okay.

275
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,431
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

276
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,333
- You know?
- I don't get that reference.

277
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,485
Oh, Josh is my idol.

278
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:27,106
That man is a Vagician.

279
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,775
But Quentin, I mean,

280
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,879
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

281
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,114
As someone born in 1902,

282
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:40,373
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

283
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:45,223
Anyway, Quentin is the duck's nuts.

284
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:48,393
No, that cannot be a
real thing people said.

285
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,228
So we should send a message to Eliot.

286
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:52,197
Shit. Eliot.

287
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,403
Oh, my God. Oh!

288
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,891
Cannibals! They're cannibals!

289
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,410
- I told you!
- Oh... oh, my God.

290
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,312
They made me...

291
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:08,813
eat a person.

292
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,214
We should make a deal with them.

293
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:11,549
No.

294
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,151
You can't negotiate with cannibals.

295
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:15,657
You can't give them what they want.

296
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:18,155
- Well, can't we?
- No!

297
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,424
You're grounded.

298
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,259
We need to find a way out of here.

299
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,845
On the Muntjac, the Key created a door

300
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,162
out of nowhere when we needed it.

301
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,264
I don't see any doors or
places a door could be.

302
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,638
Downstairs in the Library!

303
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:31,525
You lied about the key.

304
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:32,739
They lied first.

305
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,656
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

306
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,540
No, you lied to me.

307
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,175
You were never collecting taxes.

308
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,658
Uh, can we have this talk when we're
not being hunted by cannibals?

309
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,033
What is the key for?

310
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,914
- Fray!
- What does it really do?

311
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,183
It doesn't... matter if
we can't find a door.

312
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:50,220
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

313
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,521
No shit!

314
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,778
I think that cannibal's sitting
on the only entry point.

315
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,958
Wait, they're coming!

316
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:56,625
Run, run, run!

317
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:58,294
Slow down!

318
00:15:58,304 --> 00:15:59,362
I have wooden toes!

319
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:04,367
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

320
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,602
Hyman, where have you been?

321
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,638
I went with them to solve the
mystery of Rupert's golden key.

322
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:11,306
Who cares?

323
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:13,769
If they find all seven keys, Penny,

324
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,811
then...

325
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,113
something good happens?

326
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:19,282
I missed a bit.

327
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,217
So the seven keys

328
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:25,120
from the story unlock magic?

329
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,255
Oh, that's...

330
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,224
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

331
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:32,861
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

332
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,129
in World War II.

333
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,297
His name was Lance Morrison.

334
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:37,900
And it turns out that after the war,

335
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,236
Lance went to a magic school.

336
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,904
- Breakbills.
- Right.

337
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:46,240
So if there are any records
from the late 1940s,

338
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,364
maybe that can help us find the key.

339
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,812
My assistant's file
cabinet, bottom drawer.

340
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,422
Thank you.

341
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:57,442
- Pardon the interruption.
- Can I help you?

342
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:58,853
Wait a minute. I know that guy.

343
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:00,221
I certainly hope you can.

344
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,543
I'm here on behalf of the Order.

345
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:07,594
At the Library formerly
headquartered in the Neitherlands?

346
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,263
We need to talk about Penny.

347
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:16,637
Sorry to be blunt, but did
Penny die a traumatic death?

348
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,178
Dean Fogg said you were the one to ask.

349
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,610
Yes, it was traumatic.

350
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,847
That explains it.

351
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,282
Penny signed a contract with The Order,

352
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:33,453
guaranteeing his services in
this life and, well, beyond.

353
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:37,429
Curiously, his soul never reported for
service to our Underworld branch.

354
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,260
- Then where is he?
- I'm right here.

355
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,528
Likely in the process of
becoming a vengeful spirit.

356
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:44,898
Best to nip that in the bud
before his time is up.

357
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:46,135
What do you mean?

358
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:49,201
The soul is tethered to the body
for seven days after death.

359
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:52,238
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

360
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:53,272
and send him on his way.

361
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,976
- How?
- Eat him, naturally.

362
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:59,119
Oh, sweetheart, I'm not gonna eat him.

363
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,247
I'm a pescatarian.

364
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,475
The Order has retained the
services of a Corpse Eater

365
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:06,952
- for situations such as this.
- No one is eating my body, okay?

366
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,764
I'm not... done with it yet.

367
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,322
Kind of a ticking clock on this.

368
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:13,592
If the tether goes before Penny's
soul passes on, he's right...

369
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,328
The Corpse Eater needs
a tick to prepare.

370
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:19,631
She'll be here tomorrow at sundown.

371
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:25,304
Oh, and you're welcome.

372
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:32,245
The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

373
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,913
But Penny still has his tether.

374
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,382
I'm not a ghost!

375
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,217
If he's a ghost, shouldn't he be,

376
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:40,254
I don't... I don't know, haunting us?

377
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,541
What if something else happened?

378
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,590
Yes, something else did happen!

379
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,393
It can take decades for a
spirit to become malevolent.

380
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:49,129
Corpse Eaters are a rare creature.

381
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:51,264
If the Librarians actually have one,

382
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:55,268
not just some sicko who
wants a free meal,

383
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:56,636
you should use it.

384
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:59,939
But what if there's a way to fix him?

385
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:01,440
To bring him back?

386
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,335
Without magic?

387
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,245
Julia has magic.

388
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:09,181
Okay, not much, but I...

389
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,285
It's just, I... I... I
can't wrap my head around

390
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:15,954
sending him to work for the
Library for a billion years.

391
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:17,408
I don't trust them.

392
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,505
There you go. Come on, Kady.

393
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,424
The Underworld's not so bad.

394
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:23,843
Quentin says there's a bowling alley.

395
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:26,685
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

396
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,088
Damn it, Alice.

397
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,857
I thought we were bros.

398
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:33,085
Aah, let go, let go, let go!

399
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,770
My God!

400
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:36,738
I was only trying to follow the story.

401
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:40,516
No, what Julia does in
the bath is not story!

402
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,420
It is revealing... of character.

403
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:47,478
Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

404
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:48,658
Okay?

405
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,509
Now, I don't give a shit if it
didn't end well for you in the past.

406
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,878
You are going to help me.

407
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:58,002
Or I will cock block you
for the rest of time.

408
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,564
Okay.

409
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:07,961
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

410
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:10,797
I spent months trying to push things.

411
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,275
I never got anywhere.

412
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:15,838
Until I tried being the thing.

413
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,099
Okay, focus on a penny.

414
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,530
Ha ha, get it? 'Cause of your name?

415
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,766
You get it.

416
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:28,602
Now, you're not gonna
try to move the penny.

417
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,317
You're gonna try to be it.

418
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:35,394
So... so pour yourself into its shape.

419
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:38,298
Inhabit it with your whole being.

420
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,809
Go ahead.

421
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:42,452
Be the penny. Okay.

422
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,972
I got this.

423
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,637
Be the penny.

424
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:47,768
_

425
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,536
Just be the goddamn penny!

426
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,068
- Penny, just be it!
- What does that even mean?

427
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,443
You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

428
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,275
Maybe we should have
started with a nickel.

429
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:57,825
- Wha... - Huh?
- Be the nickel!

430
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:00,169
Maybe you shouldn't say
the same dumb shit

431
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,193
over and over! Oh!

432
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,329
I'm sorry, but you're a dullard!

433
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,557
A real dunce, I say!

434
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,101
You are worth less than a penny,

435
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:10,736
and a penny is worthless!

436
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:15,279
Um...

437
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,197
This is weird.

438
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:19,597
You are the Penny.

439
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,120
What do I do now? I can't move.

440
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,891
Well, how could you? You
don't have any feet.

441
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,627
What are you... what are you doing?

442
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:31,074
It sounds like you're pooping.

443
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,764
Holy zerts! You did it!

444
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:40,246
I still have the taste
of pennies in my mouth.

445
00:21:42,642 --> 00:21:45,469
Wait, why... why don't I...

446
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:47,779
Why don't I just project
myself into my own body?

447
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,481
I know how to be that.

448
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,149
The only reason you're still alive

449
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,718
is because you were Astral
Projecting when you died.

450
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:56,020
So if you go back into your corpse,

451
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,798
you'll just be... dead.

452
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,460
I need something bigger.

453
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,395
I need something that can talk.

454
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,397
Yeah, uh, hey, be careful.

455
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:10,475
Controlling things with
brains is much harder.

456
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:13,779
Be the bunny.

457
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:15,571
Be the bunny.

458
00:22:15,582 --> 00:22:19,084
- Be the bunny.
- It won't work.

459
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:23,147
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

460
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:26,457
with a few days' time out
on Eliot's party boat?

461
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:29,822
Your Majesty, upon our
return to Whitespire,

462
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:34,490
might I suggest a hot
bath to relax yourself?

463
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:39,638
I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

464
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:42,803
I keep waiting for Eliot to come back.

465
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:45,136
But maybe he never will.

466
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:48,539
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

467
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:52,813
For all I know, he's dead.

468
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:56,191
And him and Penny are blowing
each other in Heaven.

469
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:02,018
Now, when I get back...

470
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,941
I'm gonna fix this.

471
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:08,492
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

472
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:11,495
Tick, you're gonna go to
that fairy-repelling hallway

473
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:14,164
and you're gonna grind one
of those bricks to dust.

474
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:17,087
You're gonna put it in the
Fairy Queen's bath...

475
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:20,525
and when that knocks her on her ass...

476
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:23,740
I'm gonna cut out her heart and eat it

477
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,954
in front of every goddamn
Fairy asshole in the Kingdom.

478
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:31,325
Damn. Girl, you get shit done.

479
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,966
And I thought Hyman was a perv.

480
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,670
Be the Margolem.

481
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:58,951
Be the Margolem.

482
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,478
Uh, um, um, announcement.

483
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:05,542
You guys remember the Margolem?

484
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:07,882
Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

485
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,698
Since Margo's been gone,
I've been storing it.

486
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,486
You know, for safekeeping?

487
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:13,507
Eww.

488
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,573
That's problematic.

489
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:19,178
It's not like that. I just dress her
up and pretend she respects me.

490
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,496
Anyways, she's been out of
commission since magic died, only...

491
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,706
She woke up.

492
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:54,163
I told you it wouldn't end well.

493
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:57,048
You know, I wish you weren't dead

494
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,493
so I could kill you.

495
00:24:58,504 --> 00:24:59,735
<i>So, this Margolem must've had</i>

496
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:03,173
some residual magic left in her.

497
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:06,399
Or the living clay she was made
of was a magical creature?

498
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,282
Uh, anyway, while we have you here,

499
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:11,086
we found Lance Morrison's
Breakbill records.

500
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,798
Um, it says that he was only
a student for a semester.

501
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:17,157
But it also says in this file that
he left because of a "code seven."

502
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:19,160
Student suicide.

503
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:20,863
Or he magically exploded.

504
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:23,376
I don't know why they use the
same damn code for both.

505
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:26,266
Okay, either way, he died on campus.

506
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,134
So the key might still be here, right?

507
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:29,923
But it says he was
living in the West Dorm,

508
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,516
- and there is no such thing, so...
- That's because it's buried.

509
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,298
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

510
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,016
In the late 1940s, there was
a haunting in the West Dorm.

511
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:41,954
At the time, it was considered bad
form to have a ghost on campus.

512
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:45,329
Unlike today, where we put
it in the goddamn brochure.

513
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,666
"That ghost" is gonna kill them.

514
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:49,938
To death, Penny.

515
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,974
So, the Dean buried the whole dorm.

516
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:55,305
Magically protected the entrances
so that students couldn't find it.

517
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:59,622
But magic is gone. So
we can walk right in.

518
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:00,663
Right?

519
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:01,698
What are you gonna do?

520
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:02,865
Nothing.

521
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,867
It's not my problem.

522
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:07,535
- They're your friends.
- Who I can't help in any way.

523
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,348
You go figure some shit out.

524
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,675
I'm not going down there.

525
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:13,943
What are you scared of?

526
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:15,377
You're dead already.

527
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:17,747
You're so dumb, Penny.

528
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:21,250
Ghosts can hurt whatever it is we are.

529
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,405
That one in the West dorm?

530
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,733
Terrorized me for a week.

531
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:27,389
Wait a minute.

532
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,594
If they can hurt us, then...
then they can see us.

533
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,649
Hey. Q.

534
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,506
All right.

535
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:12,367
Um, excuse me.

536
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,214
Lance Morrison?

537
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:15,669
Who are you?

538
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,984
Did my father send you? You can tell
him I am not coming home for winter.

539
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,675
Hey, ghost boy.

540
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:23,414
We need to talk.

541
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,889
You need to tell them that Penny

542
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:29,627
- is in the room with them.
- What are you talking about?

543
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,501
- Well...
- No, I am not a bitch!

544
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,569
- Well, we don't think that.
- Right, no, of course.

545
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:36,744
Do you know anything about a golden key

546
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,158
that maybe your friend
Rupert Chatwin gave you?

547
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:43,809
Rupert?

548
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,923
This place is quite something.

549
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,075
Nothing compared to where you've been.

550
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:53,555
He's in a ghost loop. He's
not even listening to us.

551
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:55,191
I brought you something.

552
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,526
From Fillory. Here.

553
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,461
Take it.

554
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:04,099
It won't hurt. It just reveals
the honest truth of things.

555
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:07,345
Shows them as they truly are.

556
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,746
I see.

557
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,288
Damn it, Hyman.

558
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,045
This isn't terrifying. It's
just two dudes kissing.

559
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,622
You homophobic pussy.

560
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,592
Lance Morrison.

561
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:36,630
You've been speaking out of turn
about your mother's family.

562
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,334
You have sullied the McAllistair name.

563
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:44,304
- All I did was tell the truth.
- Truth can bury us.

564
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:45,740
It's the key.

565
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,427
It's ruined everything.

566
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:49,982
Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt
this little father-son moment,

567
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:52,654
but could someone please
just say the words,

568
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:55,341
"Penny is in the room"?

569
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:58,274
- Say it isn't true.
- Okay.

570
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:01,443
You can't control yourself.

571
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:04,498
Don't blame the key for your perversion.

572
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,545
Whoa, dude!

573
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:07,928
Whoa!

574
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,648
The key's in the dad's pocket.

575
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,545
I think he just...

576
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,179
Oh, shit.

577
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:36,956
I tried being nice.
You will say my name.

578
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,248
You say my name, you ghost dick!

579
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:40,893
What is your name?

580
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:42,361
That's not a name!

581
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:43,695
No, it isn't!

582
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:45,522
No, it isn't!

583
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,232
Uh, Q?

584
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,301
I think we might have broken this ride.

585
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:50,368
No!

586
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:07,267
The Library has a Corpse Eater that
can help take him to the Underworld.

587
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:09,991
What's she saying?

588
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:11,922
What... What..., stop signing!

589
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,397
- Burn his body.
- Burn his body?

590
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:15,725
Oh, hell no.

591
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:17,727
Then he'll be stuck there for eternity,

592
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:20,916
turning into a ghost, or... or worse.

593
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:25,186
She says, "Better than a slave
"to the people who killed him.

594
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,703
For a billion years."

595
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:28,475
Am I the only one that
knows that eternity

596
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:31,002
is a lot longer than a billion years?

597
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,631
Lance said his mom was a McAllistair.

598
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:38,319
Well, that would explain how
he got into Brakebills.

599
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,047
The McAllistairs are on
the Board of Trustees.

600
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,516
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

601
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:46,477
Lance's father held the key. I
mean, he knew how powerful it was.

602
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:49,899
That it would reveal truth. It would
show things that were hidden.

603
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,427
So, he would have kept it.

604
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:54,461
Except that he would
have died by now, so...

605
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:56,602
Wait, could you get us into that house?

606
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:57,925
Maybe.

607
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:00,519
Irene McAllistair's been
calling me every day

608
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,631
looking for a lead on magic.

609
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,550
Perhaps if we could give her
something that she really wants.

610
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:12,507
Hey, have you been paying attention
to Quentin's stupid key thing?

611
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,472
- Have I?
- Yeah, great, shut up.

612
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:18,308
The ghost said it has the power
to reveal things that are hidden.

613
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:21,515
I'm a hidden thing.

614
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,681
Twist.

615
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:25,519
Okay, tonight it'll be
seven days since I died.

616
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:27,189
If I don't contact Kady today,

617
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,859
she is either gonna burn my corpse,

618
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,129
or worse, give it to the Library.

619
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,673
I'm not getting eaten.

620
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,751
You know, Q said Eliot already
found one of those keys.

621
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,048
Okay, simple plan.

622
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,019
We use the key to make a
Shadow Bat monster illusion

623
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,522
like that priest did on that island.

624
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:45,033
We scare away the bad men,
we get to a book chute,

625
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:46,775
we find a door, and we get the hell out.

626
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,243
- Okay.
- Okay.

627
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:55,295
Please tell me you can see me.

628
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:02,589
- Jesus.
- Holy moly.

629
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,189
What have I done?

630
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,226
Eliot, what the hell are you wearing?

631
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:10,728
Hi... Dad.

632
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,861
Hi, Dad.

633
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:14,859
This is your father? Hi, Grandpa.

634
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,963
What is with everyone and
their daddy issues today?

635
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,831
Dressed like that, everyone's gonna know

636
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,817
you haven't worked a day in your life.

637
00:32:21,828 --> 00:32:24,048
- It's just an illusion.
- I didn't think you could make

638
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,954
a sailor's uniform look gayer.

639
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,118
- My God.
- It's just an illusion.

640
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:31,814
Eliot, you might be the only person
in the multiverse more... than me.

641
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,228
You're just an illusion.

642
00:32:33,238 --> 00:32:34,892
I wish I could help.

643
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:41,235
- Henry.
- How are you?

644
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:44,606
Oh, it is so good to see you!

645
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:47,276
I was so happy when you called.

646
00:32:47,286 --> 00:32:49,606
Yeah. Irene, these are my students.

647
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:52,684
Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure.
Come on in.

648
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,098
Okay, there's some real
"Beauty and the Beast"

649
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,835
kind of stuff happening here.

650
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:07,205
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

651
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:09,430
Well, the house's enchantments run

652
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,267
on a reserve of energy that my
father built up over decades.

653
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,934
When he was a child, there was a
blackout that lasted for months.

654
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:19,007
So he wanted to be prepared.

655
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:20,739
Please, come. Follow me.

656
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:24,512
Unfortunately, they won't last.

657
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:27,192
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

658
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:30,239
Which is why I was so intrigued
by your call, Henry.

659
00:33:31,962 --> 00:33:34,184
Would you like a martini?

660
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:36,395
Martini!

661
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:42,676
Um, can I get an olive in mine, please?

662
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:48,059
Thank you.

663
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:50,708
Thank you.

664
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:56,864
So, which one of you can do magic?

665
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:59,137
Um...

666
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:01,770
Well, I, um...

667
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:06,977
So, before I knew about
magic, real magic,

668
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:09,475
I... I used to do a lot of
sleight of hand tricks.

669
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:15,060
So, it turns out that I
wasn't very good at it.

670
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:20,366
Um, I was cheating, um, by
using translocation spells

671
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:22,334
without really knowing it.

672
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:28,674
Uh, I don't know why, but,
um, those tricks still work.

673
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:31,967
Or you have a squished
olive in your pocket.

674
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,932
Fascinating.

675
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,718
Not at all useful, but, uh...

676
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,286
I can do more.

677
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,421
Um, do you have a deck of cards?

678
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,591
Uh, excuse me.

679
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,358
Where's your restroom?

680
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:07,444
Holy shit.

681
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:21,380
I'm sorry, Penny.

682
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:23,962
It's been six and a half days.

683
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:26,735
Time's up.

684
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,484
Come on.

685
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,657
Come on, find it!

686
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,593
Come on!

687
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,665
Damn it.

688
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:46,468
Kady, wait.

689
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,812
I just need more time.

690
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:58,518
It's not too late.

691
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:00,983
Corpse Eater'll be here any minute.

692
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:04,356
Honestly, why do you care?

693
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:05,815
He was my friend.

694
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:08,151
He wasn't one of you.

695
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,764
You're right. I barely knew Penny.

696
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:17,682
I don't know where he was from,
I don't know about his family,

697
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,572
I don't know... I don't
know how he found magic.

698
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,299
But I know what it's like to be trapped

699
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:28,214
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

700
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:31,376
But in the Underworld,

701
00:37:32,076 --> 00:37:34,034
he still gets to be Penny.

702
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:36,554
Dammit, Alice, I'm still me.

703
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:40,925
It took everything I had

704
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,261
to try to save his life.

705
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,513
And then...

706
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,349
he died anyway.

707
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:54,029
And then, I... and then I was relieved.

708
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,392
To be done.

709
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,578
If Penny was here...

710
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:05,549
If he could tell us what he wanted...

711
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,832
But he's not.

712
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:10,788
Okay, look, they're
both terrible options,

713
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:14,491
but if I had to choose, please
don't send me to the Underworld.

714
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:19,629
I know you don't want
the responsibility.

715
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,322
So don't take it.

716
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,503
Let me.

717
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:29,806
No, Kady, please.

718
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,338
Be the candle.

719
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:40,072
Be the candle.

720
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,354
I'll go get the Corpse Eater.

721
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,259
Penny...

722
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:04,392
That's uncomfortable to hold

723
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,643
makes me feel like.

724
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:10,365
I don't know, like I'm
not really myself.

725
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,365
Okay, then I will...

726
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:16,949
pass on touching it.

727
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:20,002
Oh, uh, I checked the book.

728
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:22,705
Uh, so, you unlocked chapter three.

729
00:39:22,715 --> 00:39:27,009
Um, and it looks like the...
the next key

730
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:28,343
might be in Fillary, maybe.

731
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,345
Um...

732
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:33,982
Dean Fogg.

733
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:35,316
Good morning.

734
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,332
Yeah. It is the morning.

735
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,755
Irene sent her apologies.

736
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:44,559
Our little show did not
convince her last night.

737
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:46,839
We're out of time. As of this morning,

738
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,243
the Board of Directors put
Breakbills up for sale.

739
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:51,433
The school will be closed.

740
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,802
I'm out of a job.

741
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:54,836
And I'd say you're evicted,

742
00:39:54,846 --> 00:40:01,383
but I have no idea who
actually owns this building.

743
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:04,153
Uh, Quentin, is this Scotch or Rye?

744
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:07,381
- Uh, rum.
- Excellent.

745
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:10,312
Well, carry on.

746
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:12,515
I'm going to go lie down.

747
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:18,859
Well, look at it this way.

748
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:22,863
Uh, now we've both been kicked
out of Breakbills, so...

749
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:24,698
we've got that in common.

750
00:40:28,311 --> 00:40:29,770
Holy shit.

751
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:37,308
- Thank Christ.
- Eliot?

752
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:39,512
- Hey.
- How did you...

753
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,781
Hey.

754
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,475
Can I please have some water?

755
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:46,545
- Yeah, sure.
- Sparkling, please.

756
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:54,573
Gather 'round.

757
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:59,019
Story time with Uncle Eliot.

758
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,261
This story is called...

759
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:06,503
"Eliot did nothing wrong but
was chased by cannibals

760
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:08,572
through the... Neitherlands anyway."

761
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,144
Sorry, who's this?

762
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:12,646
Oh, right, yeah. Meet Fray.

763
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:13,808
Our daughter.

764
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:15,706
I'm sorr... your... Wait, your daughter?

765
00:41:15,717 --> 00:41:18,667
Please, hold your
questions till the end.

766
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,938
So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

767
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:26,269
Naturally, I resolved to use the key,

768
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,042
which, in Fillory, created
illusions of a terrifying monster.

769
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:33,487
- He made his father instead.
- No spoilers.

770
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:35,964
But, yeah. What she said.

771
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:39,073
Turns out the key creates
illusions of what you most fear.

772
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,230
Hence...

773
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:42,195
My dad.

774
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:45,183
I told my father that
the guys in the tent

775
00:41:45,194 --> 00:41:48,883
didn't know the difference
between a tractor and a backhoe.

776
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:51,995
So he went to set them straight.

777
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:55,099
You saying you... you fed your...

778
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,835
your dad to cannibals?

779
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:59,605
An illusion of him. But yes.

780
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:02,441
It was very cathartic.

781
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:05,316
There was lots of
screaming on both sides.

782
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:08,612
But we snuck right past them.

783
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,978
We found a key, too.

784
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:13,784
- Oh.
- Um...

785
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,075
We've been... We've been
calling it the truth key

786
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:18,044
'cause it... well, it reveals truths.

787
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:20,078
- Truths.
- I can handle a little truth.

788
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,984
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 - 
- www.addic7ed.com -

789
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:26,737
I don't know.

790
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:28,191
I don't see anything.

791
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:30,187
Maybe it doesn't work on me.

792
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,781
- Oh, hey, Penny.
- Wai...
