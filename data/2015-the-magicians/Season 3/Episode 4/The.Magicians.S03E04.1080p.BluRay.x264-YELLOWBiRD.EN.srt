1
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:02,585
Previously on The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:04,106
Q, I think this is it.

3
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:05,307
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

4
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:07,206
Jules, this is our quest.

5
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,952
Was there always a keyhole right there?

6
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:13,315
The eye can never be fixed.

7
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,484
But you can't spy on me anymore.

8
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,553
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

9
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:19,120
to think about what you've done.

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,656
Alice!

11
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,329
I'm sorry. You called me too late.

12
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,465
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He can't.

13
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,634
No, come on, Pen. Don't, don't, come on.

14
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:35,644
Oh, no. Shit.

15
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:42,477
What the fuck is happening?

16
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:44,579
We have to do something.

17
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:46,300
Do something!

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,748
Kady.

19
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,950
Kady, he's gone.

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,060
No.

21
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:57,925
K... Kady. Kady, I'm right...

22
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:06,600
You need to hear me.

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,468
I was astral projecting.

24
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,538
I wasn't in my body when I died...
it died.

25
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:12,606
Damn it!

26
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,613
Damn it.

27
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:22,849
Damn it!

28
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,854
Q. Hey.

29
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:31,524
Hey, I, uh... What's wrong?

30
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:36,291
Um... it's... It's Penny.

31
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:50,243
Oh, come on.

32
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm sorry. Do you ever have, like,

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,816
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't...

34
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:05,824
Um...

35
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,527
Why is nobody crying?

36
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:15,734
I saved all your asses so many times.

37
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,134
Appreciate me!

38
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:30,681
Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

39
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:34,685
Yes?

40
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,587
Okay, um, yeah.

41
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:40,024
We're here today to remember the life

42
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,861
of a friend and student.

43
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:47,364
Uh, William Penny Adi...

44
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:50,033
Adi... Uh...

45
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:52,110
I don't really know how to
pronounce his last name.

46
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,621
It's Adiyodi. Idiot.

47
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,977
Penny was complicated.

48
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:59,876
And I... I, uh, think
he probably hated me.

49
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:03,646
But, um...

50
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:05,648
None of us really knew him.

51
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:06,983
Not even me.

52
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,286
That's how he wanted it.

53
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:12,289
So, uh...

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,275
All I can really say is, uh...

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,636
I am so screwed.

56
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:58,633
Okay, come on.

57
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,134
Damn it.

58
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,036
Yo.

59
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:10,644
Bodi, you down there?

60
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,046
Shep!

61
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:14,298
I found one of them soft ones you like.

62
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,431
Don't burn it.

63
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,387
Oh, the vellum feels nice on my ass.

64
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:21,655
No, no, no, no, no. I need that.

65
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,391
I got a surprise for you, too.

66
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,105
Fresh meat upstairs.

67
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:26,133
What's it been?

68
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:28,691
Two weeks since we caught the Librarian?

69
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,464
Not much left but gristle.

70
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:38,273
You ate a Librarian?

71
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,441
Hi, there.

72
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,777
- Eliot?
- Hello, kind strangers.

73
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:45,879
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

74
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,748
That's a bad move, Eliot.

75
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,283
What brought you to the Neitherlands?

76
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,151
Family vacation.

77
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,453
No, I mean...

78
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:54,288
We got here using magic beans.

79
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:56,141
- We used a magic key.
- Right.

80
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:59,946
But there's no magic now, so, um...
so we're stuck.

81
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:02,049
- Like you?
- That's right.

82
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,831
Fountains are all frozen over.

83
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:05,165
We haven't eaten in days.

84
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,134
Right, um...

85
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:10,237
If you had a... an extra
sandwich or something...

86
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,572
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

87
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:14,274
- Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

88
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:17,109
No, no, no. No, Eliot, don't!
They're cannibals!

89
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,338
Oh, God.

90
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,179
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

91
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,148
No, that's... don't eat that.

92
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,783
No, don't eat that, please.

93
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,933
You're eating a dude! Mmm, it's not bad.

94
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:29,144
Oh, man, seriously fuck this place!

95
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,292
I can't believe that he's gone.

96
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,361
I mean, we were never really that close.

97
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:38,464
But I don't know, I...

98
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:41,097
I loved him, I think.

99
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,434
It's just... how come
you never really know

100
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:47,198
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

102
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,728
Hmm. What?

103
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,511
I loved that.

104
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,967
Were you close with your dad?

105
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:04,036
Oh... For fuck's sake.

106
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,071
I saw him a few weeks ago.

107
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,740
It's crazy.

108
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,810
Um... the cancer that he had

109
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,979
was sort of... inherently magical,

110
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,413
so magic went away, and...

111
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:19,491
He's, like, in remission.

112
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:23,615
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um...

113
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,685
No, it's good. It's good.

114
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:29,562
it's the one good thing
to come out of this.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,592
I didn't know when I was
gonna see you again.

116
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,560
I had nowhere else to go.

117
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,697
After the burial, I can't be
in the same room as my mom.

118
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:41,366
I mean, we could use your help.

119
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,568
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back...

120
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:45,992
Honestly, I don't think we should.

121
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,020
Okay, I don't really know
where to begin with that.

122
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,909
But, I mean, for starters, I mean,

123
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,711
this is... this is our quest.

124
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,327
I sort of feel like we were elected.

125
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:55,983
It's magic. Jesus, Alice, I...

126
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:59,383
You turn it back on, what
happens to your dad?

127
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:04,622
Sometimes I want magic
back more than anything.

128
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,825
And sometimes I just...

129
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:10,894
I look around and... and see
what a mess we made with it.

130
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,631
Right now I just wanna be 23,

131
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,532
and not know what I want, and
not know what I'm doing.

132
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:20,946
Yeah.

133
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,293
Oh, God.

134
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:30,747
I just remembered, I have to tell.

135
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,415
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

136
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,785
How? Aren't they in Fillory?

137
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,102
What are you doing?

138
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:56,673
That was super weird.

139
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,641
Your Majesty, if you would prefer,

140
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:02,102
we can put into harbor at,
uh, Broken Bay instead.

141
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:03,946
When did you get this sweet boat?

142
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,982
Man.

143
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,926
I miss all the cool shit.

144
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:09,785
We don't have a choice.

145
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:11,720
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

146
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,107
the Fairy Queen will fly in on the
back of some whimsical animal,

147
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:16,936
and she'll slit our throats, or worse.

148
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,111
A messenger bunny, Your Majesty.

149
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,211
Penny's dead. Sorry.

150
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,180
Penny's dead?

151
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,515
Was he not already?

152
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:34,649
What?

153
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,885
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,988
finally!

155
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:41,990
He was my best friend.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,193
Okay, I mean, all right.

157
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:48,404
I guess I always thought
someday we were gonna bang.

158
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:51,866
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

159
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,505
You know, I... I thought
we'd have normal problems.

160
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:59,100
Like, I'd look at other
girls, and you'd get mad.

161
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:01,275
Or you'd tell me a story
for the third time,

162
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:03,561
and we'd realize we have
nothing left to say.

163
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:06,439
But we don't get normal problems.

164
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:11,395
I know what you're looking for. Don't.

165
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,731
This is stupid.

166
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:19,825
What do you think this is gonna solve?

167
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:24,453
You can't hear a word I say.

168
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,867
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

169
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:30,915
if I can't do a damn
thing about it, so...

170
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,828
I'm gonna go.

171
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,898
Try and find some way to fix this.

172
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,756
Goodbye, Kady.

173
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,488
Julia.

174
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:54,324
Help her. Now.

175
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,076
- What?
- The hell?

176
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:58,479
You're the only one who can.

177
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,912
What? What... what happened?

178
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:15,588
- Jesus.
- Kady!

179
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,009
- Kady, come on!
- Um...

180
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:23,151
Kady...

181
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:25,488
Come on!

182
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:32,581
Come on. Please, Kady.

183
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,315
Wake up.

184
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:36,754
Okay. Okay.

185
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,393
Okay, baby.

186
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,229
Okay.

187
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,753
Holy shit, that was gross.

188
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,159
What?

189
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:50,620
You... you can see me?

190
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,167
You can see me?

191
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,302
Hey, what's your deal?

192
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:02,224
Sorry.

193
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,173
It's just, you're talking to me,

194
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:07,376
and not through me, and that's...
that's kind of huge, Penny.

195
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:08,543
How do you know my name?

196
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:12,513
Well, I've been watching you and
your friends since you got here.

197
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:15,115
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

198
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,452
- Hyman?
- Mmm-hmm.

199
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:20,221
Did that mean something
different when you were born?

200
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,457
Wait, you... you haven't heard of me?

201
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:26,895
The Pervert Ghost of Brakebills?

202
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:29,417
I was a student here in the 1920s.

203
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:30,899
A Traveler, like you.

204
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:34,238
I would practice Astral
Projection around the campus.

205
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:36,570
You know, pop into
lectures, the dormitories,

206
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,840
uh, showers, you know how it is.

207
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,242
- Uh, no.
- And as a prank,

208
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:43,912
someone moved my body while I was...

209
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:46,314
Being a... pervert.

210
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:50,250
And, yes, in their defense, I
was given several warnings.

211
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,420
But I never found my body.

212
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,857
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

213
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,226
it must have died without me in it.

214
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,595
- That's a bummer.
- Well, joke's on them.

215
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,230
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

216
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,362
So it's all peeping, all the time.

217
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:09,837
You know you're not a ghost, right?

218
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,271
Wha... I'm not?

219
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,887
You were on the Astral
Plane when you died.

220
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,004
So was I.

221
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:16,707
Our minds were traveling.

222
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:19,279
Now they have no place to go back to.

223
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,645
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

224
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,676
so they relive their
death over and over.

225
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,250
Are you doing that?

226
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,355
People can see ghosts.

227
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,256
Ghosts can touch things.

228
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,559
I know, 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

229
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,228
and it wasn't great. We can't do that.

230
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:38,931
Okay, Professor, then how
come I can sit in a chair?

231
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,852
Why... why am I not
just falling forever?

232
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:44,871
I don't know. I don't make the rules.
Your ass just knows.

233
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,973
Look, didn't you... didn't
you figure all this shit out

234
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,308
100 years ago when you died?

235
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,323
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

236
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:55,313
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive... ish?

237
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:57,483
Believe me, I tried everything.

238
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,451
For years.

239
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:02,236
It did not end well.

240
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,990
- What do you mean, it didn't end...
- Shh. Shut up.

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,892
Shut up.

242
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,328
How's Kady?

244
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:12,264
Sleeping it off in the infirmary.

245
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:15,273
How did you know to knock down her door?

246
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,635
- Just a feeling.
- Okay.

247
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,337
They're my favorite pairing.

248
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,339
The... the tension between them.

249
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,860
Friends for years, but
he's always loved her.

250
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,477
You're in a bit of a
research K-Hole here, huh?

251
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,413
- Mm, yeah.
- It's cool.

252
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,315
It just reminds me of me.

253
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:33,678
So, the second key... So,
the knight's daughter,

254
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,928
she found it in a sentient cave

255
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,345
that just kept asking her riddles,

256
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:39,412
and wouldn't let her in
until it deemed her worthy.

257
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,458
- It was very patronizing.
- Wait. Why does that sound familiar?

258
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:46,030
Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

259
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,489
in the first Fillory book,
"The World in the Walls."

260
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,629
He was being chased by a
belligerent cassowary.

261
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,231
- I remember.
- Right.

262
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:55,672
Um, so he finds this
mountain of treasure,

263
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:57,749
uh, but only takes one item.

264
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,054
A golden key.

265
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,655
- To bring to his friend.
- Right, that he met during the war.

266
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,680
So, look, if this story is real,

267
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,050
and he actually did give him
the key, then I... I...

268
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,687
Jules, I think the key is here on Earth.

269
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,956
Seriously?

270
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,391
These two?

271
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,393
You and Kady are great.

272
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,295
I totally ship that.

273
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,297
Alice is okay.

274
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:22,631
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

275
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,533
- You know?
- I don't get that reference.

276
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,685
Oh, Josh is my idol.

277
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:30,306
That man is a Vagician.

278
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,975
But Quentin, I mean,

279
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:37,079
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

280
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,314
As someone born in 1902,

281
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:43,573
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

282
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:48,423
Anyway, Quentin is the duck's nuts.

283
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:51,593
No, that cannot be a
real thing people said.

284
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:53,428
So we should send a message to Eliot.

285
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,397
Shit. Eliot.

286
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,603
Oh, my God. Oh!

287
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:06,091
Cannibals! They're cannibals!

288
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:08,610
- I told you!
- Oh... oh, my God.

289
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,512
They made me...

290
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:12,013
eat a person.

291
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,414
We should make a deal with them.

292
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:14,749
No.

293
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,351
You can't negotiate with cannibals.

294
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:18,857
You can't give them what they want.

295
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:21,355
- Well, can't we?
- No!

296
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,624
You're grounded.

297
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,459
We need to find a way out of here.

298
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,045
On the Muntjac, the Key created a door

299
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,362
out of nowhere when we needed it.

300
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,464
I don't see any doors or
places a door could be.

301
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,838
Downstairs in the Library!

302
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,725
You lied about the key.

303
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:35,939
They lied first.

304
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,856
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

305
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,740
No, you lied to me.

306
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,375
You were never collecting taxes.

307
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,858
Uh, can we have this talk when we're
not being hunted by cannibals?

308
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,233
What is the key for?

309
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,114
- Fray!
- What does it really do?

310
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,383
It doesn't... matter if
we can't find a door.

311
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:53,420
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

312
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,721
No shit!

313
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:56,978
I think that cannibal's sitting
on the only entry point.

314
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,158
Wait, they're coming!

315
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,825
Run, run, run!

316
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,494
Slow down!

317
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:02,562
I have wooden toes!

318
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:07,567
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

319
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,802
Hyman, where have you been?

320
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:12,838
I went with them to solve the
mystery of Rupert's golden key.

321
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,506
Who cares?

322
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,969
If they find all seven keys, Penny,

323
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,011
then...

324
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,313
something good happens?

325
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:22,482
I missed a bit.

326
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:25,417
So the seven keys

327
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:28,320
from the story unlock magic?

328
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,455
Oh, that's...

329
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:32,424
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

330
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:36,061
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

331
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:37,329
in World War II.

332
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:38,497
His name was Lance Morrison.

333
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,100
And it turns out that after the war,

334
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,436
Lance went to a magic school.

335
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,104
- Breakbills.
- Right.

336
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:49,440
So if there are any records
from the late 1940s,

337
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,564
maybe that can help us find the key.

338
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,012
My assistant's file
cabinet, bottom drawer.

339
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:55,622
Thank you.

340
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,642
- Pardon the interruption.
- Can I help you?

341
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,053
Wait a minute. I know that guy.

342
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,421
I certainly hope you can.

343
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,743
I'm here on behalf of the Order.

344
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:10,794
At the Library formerly
headquartered in the Neitherlands?

345
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,463
We need to talk about Penny.

346
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:19,837
Sorry to be blunt, but did
Penny die a traumatic death?

347
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,378
Dean Fogg said you were the one to ask.

348
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,810
Yes, it was traumatic.

349
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,047
That explains it.

350
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,482
Penny signed a contract with The Order,

351
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:36,653
guaranteeing his services in
this life and, well, beyond.

352
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:40,629
Curiously, his soul never reported for
service to our Underworld branch.

353
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,460
- Then where is he?
- I'm right here.

354
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,728
Likely in the process of
becoming a vengeful spirit.

355
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:48,098
Best to nip that in the bud
before his time is up.

356
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,335
What do you mean?

357
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:52,401
The soul is tethered to the body
for seven days after death.

358
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,438
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

359
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,472
and send him on his way.

360
00:17:56,482 --> 00:18:00,176
- How?
- Eat him, naturally.

361
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,319
Oh, sweetheart, I'm not gonna eat him.

362
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,447
I'm a pescatarian.

363
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,675
The Order has retained the
services of a Corpse Eater

364
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:10,152
- for situations such as this.
- No one is eating my body, okay?

365
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:11,964
I'm not fucking done with it yet.

366
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:13,522
Kind of a ticking clock on this.

367
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,792
If the tether goes before Penny's
soul passes on, he's right fucked.

368
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:19,528
The Corpse Eater needs
a tick to prepare.

369
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,831
She'll be here tomorrow at sundown.

370
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:28,504
Oh, and you're welcome.

371
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:37,745
The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

372
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:39,413
But Penny still has his tether.

373
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:40,882
I'm not a ghost!

374
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,717
If he's a ghost, shouldn't he be,

375
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:45,754
I don't... I don't know, haunting us?

376
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:47,041
What if something else happened?

377
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:49,090
Yes, something else did happen!

378
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,893
It can take decades for a
spirit to become malevolent.

379
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,629
Corpse Eaters are a rare creature.

380
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,764
If the Librarians actually have one,

381
00:18:56,774 --> 00:19:00,768
not just some sicko who
wants a free meal,

382
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,136
you should use it.

383
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:05,439
But what if there's a way to fix him?

384
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:06,940
To bring him back?

385
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:08,835
Without magic?

386
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,745
Julia has magic.

387
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:14,681
Okay, not much, but I...

388
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:17,785
It's just, I... I... I
can't wrap my head around

389
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:21,454
sending him to work for the
Library for a billion years.

390
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:22,908
I don't trust them.

391
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:25,005
There you go. Come on, Kady.

392
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,924
The Underworld's not so bad.

393
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:29,343
Quentin says there's a bowling alley.

394
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:32,185
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

395
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,588
Damn it, Alice.

396
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,357
I thought we were bros.

397
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:38,585
Aah, let go, let go, let go!

398
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,270
My God!

399
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:42,238
I was only trying to follow the story.

400
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:46,016
No, what Julia does in
the bath is not story!

401
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:48,920
It is revealing... of character.

402
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,978
Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

403
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,158
Okay?

404
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,009
Now, I don't give a shit if it
didn't end well for you in the past.

405
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,378
You are going to help me.

406
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,502
Or I will cock block you
for the rest of time.

407
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,064
Okay.

408
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:13,461
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

409
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,297
I spent months trying to push things.

410
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:17,775
I never got anywhere.

411
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:21,338
Until I tried being the thing.

412
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:28,599
Okay, focus on a penny.

413
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,030
Ha ha, get it? 'Cause of your name?

414
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,266
You get it.

415
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:34,102
Now, you're not gonna
try to move the penny.

416
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,817
You're gonna try to be it.

417
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:40,894
So... so pour yourself into its shape.

418
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,798
Inhabit it with your whole being.

419
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:46,309
Go ahead.

420
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:47,952
Be the penny. Okay.

421
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:50,472
I got this.

422
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,137
Be the penny.

423
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,036
Just be the goddamn penny!

424
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,568
- Penny, just be it!
- What does that even mean?

425
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,943
You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

426
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,775
Maybe we should have
started with a nickel.

427
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:03,325
- Wha... - Huh?
- Be the nickel!

428
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,669
Maybe you shouldn't say
the same dumb shit

429
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,693
over and over! Oh!

430
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:09,829
I'm sorry, but you're a dullard!

431
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:12,057
A real dunce, I say!

432
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:14,601
You are worth less than a penny,

433
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:16,236
and a penny is worthless!

434
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,779
Um...

435
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:22,697
This is weird.

436
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,097
You are the Penny.

437
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:27,620
What do I do now? I can't move.

438
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,391
Well, how could you? You
don't have any feet.

439
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,127
What are you... what are you doing?

440
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:36,574
It sounds like you're pooping.

441
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:38,264
Holy zerts! You did it!

442
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:45,746
I still have the taste
of pennies in my mouth.

443
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,969
Wait, why... why don't I...

444
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:53,279
Why don't I just project
myself into my own body?

445
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:54,981
I know how to be that.

446
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,649
The only reason you're still alive

447
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:59,218
is because you were Astral
Projecting when you died.

448
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,520
So if you go back into your corpse,

449
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,298
you'll just be... dead.

450
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,960
I need something bigger.

451
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,895
I need something that can talk.

452
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,897
Yeah, uh, hey, be careful.

453
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:15,975
Controlling things with
brains is much harder.

454
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:19,279
Be the bunny.

455
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:21,071
Be the bunny.

456
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:24,584
- Be the bunny.
- It won't work.

457
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:28,647
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

458
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:31,957
with a few days' time out
on Eliot's party boat?

459
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:35,322
Your Majesty, upon our
return to Whitespire,

460
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:39,990
might I suggest a hot
bath to relax yourself?

461
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:45,138
I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

462
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:48,303
I keep waiting for Eliot to come back.

463
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:50,636
But maybe he never will.

464
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:54,039
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

465
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:58,313
For all I know, he's dead.

466
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:01,691
And him and Penny are blowing
each other in Heaven.

467
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,518
Now, when I get back...

468
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:09,441
I'm gonna fix this.

469
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:13,992
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

470
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:16,995
Tick, you're gonna go to
that fairy-repelling hallway

471
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,664
and you're gonna grind one
of those bricks to dust.

472
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,587
You're gonna put it in the
Fairy Queen's bath...

473
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,025
and when that knocks her on her ass...

474
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,240
I'm gonna cut out her heart and eat it

475
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,454
in front of every goddamn
Fairy asshole in the Kingdom.

476
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,825
Damn. Girl, you get shit done.

477
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:50,466
And I thought Hyman was a perv.

478
00:23:57,873 --> 00:24:00,170
Be the Margolem.

479
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:04,451
Be the Margolem.

480
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,978
Uh, um, um, announcement.

481
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:11,042
You guys remember the Margolem?

482
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:13,382
Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

483
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:16,198
Since Margo's been gone,
I've been storing it.

484
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,986
You know, for safekeeping?

485
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,007
Eww.

486
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:20,073
That's problematic.

487
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,678
It's not like that. I just dress her
up and pretend she respects me.

488
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,996
Anyways, she's been out of
commission since magic died, only...

489
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:32,206
She woke up.

490
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,663
I told you it wouldn't end well.

491
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:02,548
You know, I wish you weren't dead

492
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,993
so I could kill you.

493
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,235
<i>So, this Margolem must've had</i>

494
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:08,673
some residual magic left in her.

495
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:11,899
Or the living clay she was made
of was a magical creature?

496
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,782
Uh, anyway, while we have you here,

497
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:16,586
we found Lance Morrison's
Breakbill records.

498
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:19,298
Um, it says that he was only
a student for a semester.

499
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,657
But it also says in this file that
he left because of a "code seven."

500
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:24,660
Student suicide.

501
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:26,363
Or he magically exploded.

502
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:28,876
I don't know why they use the
same damn code for both.

503
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,766
Okay, either way, he died on campus.

504
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:33,634
So the key might still be here, right?

505
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:35,423
But it says he was
living in the West Dorm,

506
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:38,016
- and there is no such thing, so...
- That's because it's buried.

507
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:39,798
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

508
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,516
In the late 1940s, there was
a haunting in the West Dorm.

509
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:47,454
At the time, it was considered bad
form to have a ghost on campus.

510
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:50,829
Unlike today, where we put
it in the goddamn brochure.

511
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,166
"That ghost" is gonna kill them.

512
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,438
To death, Penny.

513
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:57,474
So, the Dean buried the whole dorm.

514
00:25:57,485 --> 00:26:00,805
Magically protected the entrances
so that students couldn't find it.

515
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:05,122
But magic is gone. So
we can walk right in.

516
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,163
Right?

517
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,198
What are you gonna do?

518
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,365
Nothing.

519
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,367
It's not my problem.

520
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:13,035
- They're your friends.
- Who I can't help in any way.

521
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:14,848
You go figure some shit out.

522
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:18,175
I'm not going down there.

523
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:19,443
What are you scared of?

524
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,877
You're dead already.

525
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:23,247
You're so dumb, Penny.

526
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:26,750
Ghosts can hurt whatever it is we are.

527
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,905
That one in the West dorm?

528
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:31,233
Terrorized me for a week.

529
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:32,889
Wait a minute.

530
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:37,094
If they can hurt us, then...
then they can see us.

531
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,149
Hey. Q.

532
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,006
All right.

533
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:17,867
Um, excuse me.

534
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:19,714
Lance Morrison?

535
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:21,169
Who are you?

536
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,484
Did my father send you? You can tell
him I am not coming home for winter.

537
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,175
Hey, ghost boy.

538
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,914
We need to talk.

539
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:33,589
You need to tell them that Penny

540
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,327
- is in the room with them.
- What are you talking about?

541
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:39,201
- Well...
- No, I am not a bitch!

542
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:41,269
- Well, we don't think that.
- Right, no, of course.

543
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,444
Do you know anything about a golden key

544
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,858
that maybe your friend
Rupert Chatwin gave you?

545
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:51,509
Rupert?

546
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,623
This place is quite something.

547
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,775
Nothing compared to where you've been.

548
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,255
He's in a ghost loop. He's
not even listening to us.

549
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,891
I brought you something.

550
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:05,226
From Fillory. Here.

551
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:07,161
Take it.

552
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,799
It won't hurt. It just reveals
the honest truth of things.

553
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:15,045
Shows them as they truly are.

554
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:25,446
I see.

555
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,988
Damn it, Hyman.

556
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,745
This isn't terrifying. It's
just two dudes kissing.

557
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,322
You homophobic pussy.

558
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:40,292
Lance Morrison.

559
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:44,330
You've been speaking out of turn
about your mother's family.

560
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,034
You have sullied the McAllistair name.

561
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:52,004
- All I did was tell the truth.
- Truth can bury us.

562
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:53,440
It's the key.

563
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,127
It's ruined everything.

564
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:57,682
Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt
this little father-son moment,

565
00:28:57,693 --> 00:29:00,354
but could someone please
just say the words,

566
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,041
"Penny is in the room"?

567
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:05,974
- Say it isn't true.
- Okay.

568
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,143
You can't control yourself.

569
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:12,198
Don't blame the key for your perversion.

570
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,245
Whoa, dude!

571
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:15,628
Whoa!

572
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:27,348
The key's in the dad's pocket.

573
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:33,245
I think he just...

574
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:34,879
Oh, shit.

575
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:44,656
I tried being nice.
You will say my name.

576
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,948
You say my name, you ghost dick!

577
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,593
What is your name?

578
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,061
That's not a name!

579
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:51,395
No, it isn't!

580
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,222
No, it isn't!

581
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,932
Uh, Q?

582
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,001
I think we might have broken this ride.

583
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,068
No!

584
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:14,967
The Library has a Corpse Eater that
can help take him to the Underworld.

585
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,691
What's she saying?

586
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,622
What... What..., stop signing!

587
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:22,097
- Burn his body.
- Burn his body?

588
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:23,425
Oh, hell no.

589
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:25,427
Then he'll be stuck there for eternity,

590
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:28,616
turning into a ghost, or... or worse.

591
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,886
She says, "Better than a slave
"to the people who killed him.

592
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,403
For a billion years."

593
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:36,175
Am I the only one that
knows that eternity

594
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:38,702
is a lot longer than a billion years?

595
00:30:41,077 --> 00:30:43,331
Lance said his mom was a McAllistair.

596
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,019
Well, that would explain how
he got into Brakebills.

597
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,747
The McAllistairs are on
the Board of Trustees.

598
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:51,216
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

599
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:54,177
Lance's father held the key. I
mean, he knew how powerful it was.

600
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,599
That it would reveal truth. It would
show things that were hidden.

601
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,127
So, he would have kept it.

602
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,161
Except that he would
have died by now, so...

603
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:04,302
Wait, could you get us into that house?

604
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:05,625
Maybe.

605
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,219
Irene McAllistair's been
calling me every day

606
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,331
looking for a lead on magic.

607
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,250
Perhaps if we could give her
something that she really wants.

608
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:20,207
Hey, have you been paying attention
to Quentin's stupid key thing?

609
00:31:20,217 --> 00:31:22,172
- Have I?
- Yeah, great, shut up.

610
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:26,008
The ghost said it has the power
to reveal things that are hidden.

611
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:29,215
I'm a hidden thing.

612
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,381
Twist.

613
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:33,219
Okay, tonight it'll be
seven days since I died.

614
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:34,889
If I don't contact Kady today,

615
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,559
she is either gonna burn my corpse,

616
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,829
or worse, give it to the Library.

617
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,373
I'm not getting eaten.

618
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,451
You know, Q said Eliot already
found one of those keys.

619
00:31:44,177 --> 00:31:45,748
Okay, simple plan.

620
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,719
We use the key to make a
Shadow Bat monster illusion

621
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,222
like that priest did on that island.

622
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,733
We scare away the bad men,
we get to a book chute,

623
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,475
we find a door, and we get the hell out.

624
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:55,943
- Okay.
- Okay.

625
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:02,995
Please tell me you can see me.

626
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:10,289
- Jesus.
- Holy moly.

627
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:12,889
What have I done?

628
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,926
Eliot, what the hell are you wearing?

629
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:18,428
Hi... Dad.

630
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,392
Hi, Dad.

631
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:24,390
This is your father? Hi, Grandpa.

632
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,494
What is with everyone and
their daddy issues today?

633
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,362
Dressed like that, everyone's gonna know

634
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,348
you haven't worked a day in your life.

635
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,579
- It's just an illusion.
- I didn't think you could make

636
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,485
a sailor's uniform look gayer.

637
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,649
- My God.
- It's just an illusion.

638
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,345
Eliot, you might be the only person
in the multiverse more fucked than me.

639
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:42,759
You're just an illusion.

640
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:44,423
I wish I could help.

641
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:50,766
- Henry.
- How are you?

642
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:54,137
Oh, it is so good to see you!

643
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:56,807
I was so happy when you called.

644
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:59,137
Yeah. Irene, these are my students.

645
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:02,215
Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure.
Come on in.

646
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,629
Okay, there's some real
"Beauty and the Beast"

647
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,366
kind of stuff happening here.

648
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:16,736
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

649
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,961
Well, the house's enchantments run

650
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:22,798
on a reserve of energy that my
father built up over decades.

651
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:26,465
When he was a child, there was a
blackout that lasted for months.

652
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:28,538
So he wanted to be prepared.

653
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,270
Please, come. Follow me.

654
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:34,043
Unfortunately, they won't last.

655
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,723
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

656
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:39,770
Which is why I was so intrigued
by your call, Henry.

657
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,715
Would you like a martini?

658
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:45,926
Martini!

659
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:52,207
Um, can I get an olive in mine, please?

660
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,590
Thank you.

661
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:00,239
Thank you.

662
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,395
So, which one of you can do magic?

663
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:08,668
Um...

664
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,301
Well, I, um...

665
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:16,508
So, before I knew about
magic, real magic,

666
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:19,006
I... I used to do a lot of
sleight of hand tricks.

667
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:24,591
So, it turns out that I
wasn't very good at it.

668
00:34:24,602 --> 00:34:29,897
Um, I was cheating, um, by
using translocation spells

669
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:31,865
without really knowing it.

670
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:38,205
Uh, I don't know why, but,
um, those tricks still work.

671
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:41,498
Or you have a squished
olive in your pocket.

672
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,463
Fascinating.

673
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,249
Not at all useful, but, uh...

674
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,817
I can do more.

675
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,952
Um, do you have a deck of cards?

676
00:34:52,962 --> 00:34:55,122
Uh, excuse me.

677
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:56,889
Where's your restroom?

678
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:16,975
Holy shit.

679
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:30,911
I'm sorry, Penny.

680
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:33,493
It's been six and a half days.

681
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,266
Time's up.

682
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:58,015
Come on.

683
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:03,188
Come on, find it!

684
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,124
Come on!

685
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:12,196
Damn it.

686
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,999
Kady, wait.

687
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,343
I just need more time.

688
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,049
It's not too late.

689
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,514
Corpse Eater'll be here any minute.

690
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,887
Honestly, why do you care?

691
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,346
He was my friend.

692
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,682
He wasn't one of you.

693
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,295
You're right. I barely knew Penny.

694
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:27,213
I don't know where he was from,
I don't know about his family,

695
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:29,103
I don't know... I don't
know how he found magic.

696
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,830
But I know what it's like to be trapped

697
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:37,745
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

698
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:40,907
But in the Underworld,

699
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,565
he still gets to be Penny.

700
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,085
Dammit, Alice, I'm still me.

701
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:50,456
It took everything I had

702
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,792
to try to save his life.

703
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,044
And then...

704
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:58,880
he died anyway.

705
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,560
And then, I... and then I was relieved.

706
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,923
To be done.

707
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,109
If Penny was here...

708
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,080
If he could tell us what he wanted...

709
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:18,363
But he's not.

710
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,319
Okay, look, they're
both terrible options,

711
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:24,022
but if I had to choose, please
don't send me to the Underworld.

712
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:29,160
I know you don't want
the responsibility.

713
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:31,853
So don't take it.

714
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:36,034
Let me.

715
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:39,337
No, Kady, please.

716
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,869
Be the candle.

717
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,603
Be the candle.

718
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:51,885
I'll go get the Corpse Eater.

719
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,790
Penny...

720
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:16,023
That's uncomfortable to hold

721
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:18,274
makes me feel like.

722
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,996
I don't know, like I'm
not really myself.

723
00:39:22,718 --> 00:39:24,996
Okay, then I will...

724
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:28,580
pass on touching it.

725
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,633
Oh, uh, I checked the book.

726
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:34,336
Uh, so, you unlocked chapter three.

727
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:38,640
Um, and it looks like the...
the next key

728
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,974
might be in Fillary, maybe.

729
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:41,976
Um...

730
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:45,613
Dean Fogg.

731
00:39:45,623 --> 00:39:46,947
Good morning.

732
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:49,963
Yeah. It is the morning.

733
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:53,386
Irene sent her apologies.

734
00:39:53,397 --> 00:39:56,190
Our little show did not
convince her last night.

735
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,470
We're out of time. As of this morning,

736
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,874
the Board of Directors put
Breakbills up for sale.

737
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,064
The school will be closed.

738
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:04,433
I'm out of a job.

739
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,467
And I'd say you're evicted,

740
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:13,014
but I have no idea who
actually owns this building.

741
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:15,784
Uh, Quentin, is this Scotch or Rye?

742
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:19,012
- Uh, rum.
- Excellent.

743
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:21,943
Well, carry on.

744
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:24,146
I'm going to go lie down.

745
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:30,490
Well, look at it this way.

746
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,494
Uh, now we've both been kicked
out of Breakbills, so...

747
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:36,329
we've got that in common.

748
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:41,401
Holy shit.

749
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,939
- Thank Christ.
- Eliot?

750
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,143
- Hey.
- How did you...

751
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:53,412
Hey.

752
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:55,106
Can I please have some water?

753
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:58,176
- Yeah, sure.
- Sparkling, please.

754
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,204
Gather 'round.

755
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:10,650
Story time with Uncle Eliot.

756
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:13,892
This story is called...

757
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,134
"Eliot did nothing wrong but
was chased by cannibals

758
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,203
through the fucked Neitherlands anyway."

759
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,775
Sorry, who's this?

760
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:24,277
Oh, right, yeah. Meet Fray.

761
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:25,439
Our daughter.

762
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,337
I'm sorr... your... Wait, your daughter?

763
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:30,298
Please, hold your
questions till the end.

764
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:35,569
So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

765
00:41:35,587 --> 00:41:37,900
Naturally, I resolved to use the key,

766
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:41,673
which, in Fillory, created
illusions of a terrifying monster.

767
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:45,118
- He made his father instead.
- No spoilers.

768
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,595
But, yeah. What she said.

769
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,704
Turns out the key creates
illusions of what you most fear.

770
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:51,861
Hence...

771
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,826
My dad.

772
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:56,814
I told my father that
the guys in the tent

773
00:41:56,825 --> 00:42:00,514
didn't know the difference
between a tractor and a backhoe.

774
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:03,626
So he went to set them straight.

775
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:06,730
You saying you... you fed your...

776
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,466
your dad to cannibals?

777
00:42:08,477 --> 00:42:11,236
An illusion of him. But yes.

778
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:14,072
It was very cathartic.

779
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,947
There was lots of
screaming on both sides.

780
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,243
But we snuck right past them.

781
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:23,609
We found a key, too.

782
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,415
- Oh.
- Um...

783
00:42:25,681 --> 00:42:27,706
We've been... We've been
calling it the truth key

784
00:42:27,716 --> 00:42:29,675
'cause it... well, it reveals truths.

785
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,709
- Truths.
- I can handle a little truth.

786
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:38,368
I don't know.

787
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:39,822
I don't see anything.

788
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,818
Maybe it doesn't work on me.

789
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,412
- Oh, hey, Penny.
- Wai...
