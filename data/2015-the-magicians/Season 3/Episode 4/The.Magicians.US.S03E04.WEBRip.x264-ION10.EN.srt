00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:06,540
.

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:07,475
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:09,543
- Q, I think this is it.

4
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:10,611
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,146
- Jules, this is our quest.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,614
- Was there always
a keyhole right there?

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,349
[dramatic music]

8
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,551
- The eye can never be fixed.

9
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,221
- But you can't
spy on me anymore.

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,290
- You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

11
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,058
to think about
what you've done.

12
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,526
- Alice!

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,731
*

14
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,566
- I'm sorry.
You called me too late.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,668
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He can't.

16
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,305
No, come on, Pen.
Don't, don't, come on.

17
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,507
Oh, no.
- Shit.

18
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:46,780
What the fuck
is happening?

19
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,383
- We have to do something.

20
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,119
Do something!

21
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,486
- Kady.

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,322
- Kady, he's gone.

23
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,623
- [whispers]
No.

24
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,395
- K--Kady.
Kady, I'm right--

25
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,633
[quirky music]

26
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,237
*

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,205
You need to hear me.

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,606
I was astral projecting.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,843
I wasn't in my body
when I died--it died.

30
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:16,877
Damn it!

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,416
*

32
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,418
Damn it.

33
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,354
[screams]

34
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,621
Damn it!

35
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,558
*

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,460
- Q.
Hey.

37
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:36,197
- Hey, I, uh...
What's wrong?

38
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,601
- Um...it's...
It's Penny.

39
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:51,312
- [laughs]

40
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,647
- Oh, come on.

41
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,185
- [laughing]

42
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,719
I'm sorry.
Do you ever have, like,

43
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,590
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't--

44
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,292
Um...

45
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,202
- Why is nobody crying?

46
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:18,506
I saved all your asses
so many times.

47
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,376
Appreciate me!

48
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:34,188
- Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

49
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,390
Yes?

50
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,894
- Okay, um, yeah.

51
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,732
We're here today
to remember the life

52
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,469
of a friend and student.

53
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,206
Uh, William Penny Adi--

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,575
Adi--Uh...

55
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,710
I don't really know how
to pronounce his last name.

56
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,979
- It's Adiyodi.
Idiot.

57
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,514
- Penny was complicated.

58
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:04,652
And I--I, uh, think
he probably hated me.

59
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,955
But, um...

60
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,957
- None of us really knew him.

61
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,725
Not even me.

62
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,827
That's how he wanted it.

63
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,830
So, uh...

64
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,767
All I can really say is, uh...

65
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,944
- I am so screwed.

66
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,947
[creepy music]

67
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:41,322
*

68
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:55,636
[buzzing and sparking]

69
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,708
Okay, come on.

70
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,845
Damn it.

71
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,921
Yo.

72
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,323
- Bodi, you down there?

73
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,657
- Shep!

74
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,959
I found one of them
soft ones you like.

75
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,561
- Don't burn it.

76
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,764
- Oh, the vellum feels nice
on my ass.

77
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,334
- No, no, no, no, no.
I need that.

78
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,935
- I got a surprise for you,
too.

79
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:28,969
Fresh meat upstairs.

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,438
- What's it been?

81
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,374
Two weeks since
we caught the Librarian?

82
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,309
Not much left but gristle.

83
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,511
[chuckles]

84
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,880
- You ate a Librarian?

85
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,851
- Hi, there.

86
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,754
- Eliot?
- Hello, kind strangers.

87
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,324
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

88
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,725
- That's a bad move,
Eliot.

89
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,694
- What brought you
to the Neitherlands?

90
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,062
- Family vacation.

91
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,664
- No, I mean...

92
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,532
We got here using magic beans.

93
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,501
- We used a magic key.
- Right.

94
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:04,037
But there's no magic now,
so, um--so we're stuck.

95
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,507
Like you?
- That's right.

96
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,975
Fountains are all frozen over.

97
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,443
- We haven't eaten in days.

98
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,878
- Right, um...

99
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,482
If you had a--an extra
sandwich or something--

100
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,717
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

101
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,519
- Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

102
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,020
- No, no, no.
No, Eliot, don't!

103
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,389
They're cannibals!

104
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,723
Oh, God.

105
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,458
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

106
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,427
No, that's--
don't eat that.

107
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,761
No, don't eat that,
please.

108
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,464
You're eating a dude!
- Mmm, it's not bad.

109
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,800
- Oh, man, seriously,
fuck this place!

110
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,538
- I can't believe
that he's gone.

111
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,607
I mean, we were never
really that close.

112
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,843
But I don't know, I--

113
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,145
I loved him,
I think.

114
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,749
It's just...
how come you never really know

115
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,619
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

116
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,991
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

117
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,127
Hmm.
- What?

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,695
- I loved that.

119
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,633
Were you close with your dad?

120
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,902
- Oh... [groans]
For fuck's sake.

121
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,904
- I saw him a few weeks ago.

122
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,139
It's crazy.

123
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,509
Um...the cancer that he had

124
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,646
was sort of...
inherently magical,

125
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,449
so magic went away, and...

126
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,584
He's, like, in remission.

127
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:28,522
Sorry. I didn't mean to,
um...

128
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,191
- No, it's good. It's good.

129
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,026
it's the one good thing
to come out of this.

130
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,131
- I didn't know when I was
gonna see you again.

131
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,468
- I had nowhere else to go.

132
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,535
After the burial, I can't be

133
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,203
in the same room as my mom.

134
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,938
- I mean, we could use
your help.

135
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,108
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back--

136
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,077
- Honestly,
I don't think we should.

137
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,614
- Okay, I don't really know
where to begin with that.

138
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,749
But, I mean,
for starters, I mean,

139
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,217
this is--this is our quest.

140
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,752
I sort of feel like
we were elected.

141
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,554
It's magic.
Jesus, Alice, I--

142
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,457
- You turn it back on,
what happens to your dad?

143
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,459
- [sighs]

144
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,127
- Sometimes
I want magic back

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,530
more than anything.

146
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,699
And sometimes I just...

147
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:15,703
I look around and--and see
what a mess we made with it.

148
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,539
Right now I just wanna be 23,

149
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,973
and not know what I want,

150
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,842
and not know what I'm doing.

151
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,012
- Yeah.

152
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,552
Oh, God.

153
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,255
I just remembered,
I have to tell

154
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,124
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

155
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,760
- How?
Aren't they in Fillory?

156
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,664
[dramatic music]

157
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,132
*

158
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,900
- What are you doing?

159
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:53,974
*

160
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,711
[grunts]

161
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,582
That was super weird.

162
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,016
- Your Majesty,
if you would prefer,

163
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,687
we can put into harbor
at, uh, Broken Bay instead.

164
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,922
- When did you get
this sweet boat?

165
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,991
Man.

166
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,626
I miss all the cool shit.

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,294
- We don't have a choice.

168
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,630
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

169
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,798
the Fairy Queen will fly in

170
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,667
on the back
of some whimsical animal,

171
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,535
and she'll slit our throats,
or worse.

172
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,637
- A messenger bunny,
Your Majesty.

173
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,881
- Penny's dead.
Sorry.

174
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,016
- [whispering]
Penny's dead?

175
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,118
- Was he not already?

176
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,553
- What?

177
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,255
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

178
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,324
Fucking finally!

179
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,660
- He was my best friend.

180
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,862
- Okay, I mean,
all right.

181
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,297
- I guess I always thought

182
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,200
someday we were gonna bang.

183
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,604
- Me, too, girl.
Me, too.

184
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,772
[crickets chirping]

185
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,941
You know, I--I thought
we'd have normal problems.

186
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,711
Like, I'd look at other girls,
and you'd get mad.

187
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,879
Or you'd tell me a story
for the third time,

188
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,948
and we'd realize we have
nothing left to say.

189
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,884
But we don't get
normal problems.

190
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,123
I know what you're looking for.
Don't.

191
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:19,993
This is stupid.

192
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,097
What do you think
this is gonna solve?

193
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,801
You can't hear a word I say.

194
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:32,740
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

195
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,108
if I can't do a damn
thing about it, so...

196
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,178
I'm gonna go.

197
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,949
Try and find some way
to fix this.

198
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,689
Goodbye, Kady.

199
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:53,627
*

200
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,796
- Julia.
- [gasps]

201
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,666
- Help her.
Now.

202
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,367
- What?
- The hell?

203
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,170
- You're the only one who can.

204
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:07,407
*

205
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,110
What?
What--what happened?

206
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,646
[knocking]

207
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,249
[slamming]

208
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,785
- Oh, fuck.

209
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,888
- Jesus.
- Kady!

210
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,057
- Kady, come on!
- Um...

211
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,292
Oh...

212
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,293
*

213
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,261
- Kady...

214
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,429
Come on!

215
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,967
*

216
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:37,070
Come on.
- Please, Kady.

217
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,306
Wake up.
- [gasps]

218
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,274
- Okay.
Okay.

219
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,376
Okay, baby.

220
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,812
Okay.
- [gags]

221
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,815
- Holy shit,
that was gross.

222
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,218
What?

223
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,855
You--you can see me?

224
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:02,262
.

225
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:02,763
- Hey, what's your deal?

226
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,232
- [laughing]
Sorry.

227
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,467
It's just,
you're talking to me,

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,902
and not through me,

229
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,004
and that's--that's
kind of huge, Penny.

230
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,105
- How do you know my name?

231
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,807
- Well, I've been watching you

232
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,243
and your friends
since you got here.

233
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,779
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

234
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,048
- Hyman?
- Mmm-hmm.

235
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,717
- Did that mean something
different when you were born?

236
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:26,053
- Wait, you--
you haven't heard of me?

237
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,757
The Pervert Ghost
of Brakebills?

238
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,726
I was a student here
in the 1920s.

239
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,394
A Traveler, like you.

240
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,264
I would practice Astral
Projection around the campus.

241
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,133
You know, pop into lectures,
the dormitories,

242
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,369
uh, showers,
you know how it is.

243
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,872
- Uh, no.
- And as a prank,

244
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,407
someone moved my body
while I was--

245
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,777
- Being a fucking pervert.

246
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,914
- And, yes, in their defense,
I was given several warnings.

247
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,883
But I never found my body.

248
00:11:55,916 --> 00:12:00,220
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

249
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,890
it must have died
without me in it.

250
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,292
- That's a bummer.
- Well, joke's on them.

251
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,526
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

252
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,930
So it's all peeping,
all the time.

253
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,366
- You know you're not a ghost,
right?

254
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,902
- Wha--I'm not?

255
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,204
- You were on the Astral Plane
when you died.

256
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,305
So was I.

257
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,040
Our minds were traveling.

258
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,943
Now they have no place
to go back to.

259
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,079
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

260
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,948
so they relive their death
over and over.

261
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,216
Are you doing that?

262
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,985
People can see ghosts.

263
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,921
Ghosts can touch things.

264
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,323
I know, 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

265
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,324
and it wasn't great.

266
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,892
We can't do that.

267
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,961
- Okay, Professor,
then how come

268
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,295
I can sit in a chair?

269
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,165
Why--why am I not
just falling forever?

270
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,800
- I don't know.
I don't make the rules.

271
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,235
Your ass just knows.

272
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,470
Look, didn't you--didn't you
figure all this shit out

273
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,806
100 years ago when you died?

274
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,474
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

275
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,812
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive...ish?

276
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,248
- Believe me,
I tried everything.

277
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,216
For years.

278
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,853
It did not end well.

279
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:06,820
- What do you mean,
it didn't end--

280
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,488
- Shh.
Shut up.

281
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,423
Shut up.

282
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,492
- Hey.
- Hey.

283
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,827
How's Kady?

284
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,395
- Sleeping it off
in the infirmary.

285
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,231
- How did you know
to knock down her door?

286
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,234
- Just a feeling.
- Okay.

287
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,003
- They're my favorite pairing.

288
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,504
The--the tension
between them.

289
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,240
Friends for years,
but he's always loved her.

290
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,110
- You're in a bit of a research
K-Hole here, huh?

291
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,045
- Mm, yeah.
- It's cool.

292
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,447
It just reminds me of me.

293
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,050
- So, the second key--
So, the knight's daughter,

294
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,119
she found it in a sentient cave

295
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,553
that just kept
asking her riddles,

296
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,222
and wouldn't let her in until
it deemed her worthy.

297
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,556
It was very patronizing.
- Wait.

298
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,092
Why does that
sound familiar?

299
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,396
- Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

300
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,899
in the first Fillory book,
"The World in the Walls."

301
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,034
He was being chased by
a belligerent cassowary.

302
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,402
- I remember.
- Right.

303
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:59,272
Um, so he finds this mountain
of treasure,

304
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,640
uh, but only takes one item.

305
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,175
- A golden key.

306
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,343
To bring to his friend.

307
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,045
- Right, that he met
during the war.

308
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,280
So, look,
if this story is real,

309
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,282
and he actually did
give him the key,

310
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,417
then I--I--

311
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,053
Jules, I think the key
is here on Earth.

312
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,489
- Seriously?

313
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,892
These two?

314
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,061
- You and Kady are great.

315
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,595
I totally ship that.

316
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,597
Alice is okay.

317
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,233
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

318
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,168
You know?
- I don't get that reference.

319
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,937
- Oh, Josh is my idol.

320
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,606
That man is a Vagician.

321
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,342
But Quentin, I mean,

322
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:40,580
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

323
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,449
As someone born in 1902,

324
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,954
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

325
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:52,059
Anyway, Quentin
is the duck's nuts.

326
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:55,228
- No, that cannot be
a real thing people said.

327
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,064
- So we should send
a message to Eliot.

328
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,066
- Shit.
Eliot.

329
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,069
[dramatic music]

330
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,603
*

331
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,338
- Oh, my God.
Oh!

332
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,074
[all gasping]

333
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,509
- Cannibals!
They're cannibals!

334
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,011
- I told you!

335
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,412
- Oh--oh, my God.

336
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,147
They made me...

337
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,382
eat a person.

338
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,217
- We should make
a deal with them.

339
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,351
- No.

340
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,487
You can't negotiate
with cannibals.

341
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,122
You can't give them
what they want.

342
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,657
- Well, can't we?
- No!

343
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,227
You're grounded.

344
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,962
We need to find
a way out of here.

345
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,230
On the Muntjac,
the Key created a door

346
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,664
out of nowhere
when we needed it.

347
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,967
- I don't see any doors
or places a door could be.

348
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,202
- Downstairs in the Library!

349
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,138
- You lied about the key.

350
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,539
- They lied first.

351
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,208
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

352
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,343
- No, you lied to me.

353
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,678
You were never
collecting taxes.

354
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,580
- Uh, can we have this talk
when we're not being hunted

355
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,416
by cannibals?
- What is the key for?

356
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,484
- Fray!
- What does it really do?

357
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,686
- It doesn't fucking matter
if we can't find a door.

358
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,090
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

359
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,325
- No shit!

360
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,492
- I think that cannibal's
sitting

361
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:00,327
on the only entry point.

362
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,661
- Wait, they're coming!

363
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,563
- Run, run, run!

364
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,132
- Slow down!

365
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,266
I have wooden toes!

366
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,634
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

367
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,406
- Hyman, where have you been?

368
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,674
- I went with them
to solve the mystery

369
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,576
of Rupert's golden key.

370
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,145
- Who cares?

371
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,081
- If they find all seven keys,
Penny,

372
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,649
then...

373
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,085
something good happens?

374
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,219
I missed a bit.

375
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,022
- [sighs]
- So the seven keys

376
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,724
from the story unlock magic?

377
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,426
- Oh, that's--

378
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,662
- We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

379
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:39,699
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

380
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,733
in World War II.

381
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,235
His name was Lance Morrison.

382
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,072
And it turns out that
after the war,

383
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,175
Lance went to a magic school.

384
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,576
- Breakbills.
- Right.

385
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:53,213
So if there are any records
from the late 1940s,

386
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,714
maybe that can help us
find the key.

387
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,650
- My assistant's file cabinet,
bottom drawer.

388
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,086
- Thank you.

389
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,124
- Pardon the interruption.
- Can I help you?

390
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,692
- Wait a minute.
I know that guy.

391
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,826
- I certainly hope you can.

392
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,096
I'm here on behalf
of the Order.

393
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,299
At the Library
formerly headquartered

394
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,634
in the Neitherlands?

395
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,203
We need to talk about Penny.

396
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:20,073
*

397
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,308
Sorry to be blunt,

398
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:24,411
but did Penny die
a traumatic death?

399
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,114
Dean Fogg said
you were the one to ask.

400
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,650
- Yes, it was traumatic.

401
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,252
- That explains it.

402
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,089
Penny signed a contract
with The Order,

403
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,158
guaranteeing his services
in this life

404
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,360
and, well, beyond.

405
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,829
Curiously, his soul never
reported for service

406
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,131
to our Underworld branch.

407
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,198
- Then where is he?

408
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,699
- I'm right here.

409
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,436
- Likely in the process
of becoming a vengeful spirit.

410
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,738
Best to nip that in the bud
before his time is up.

411
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,872
- What do you mean?

412
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,174
- The soul is tethered
to the body

413
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,642
for seven days after death.

414
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,845
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

415
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,380
and send him on his way.

416
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,248
- How?

417
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,151
- Eat him, naturally.

418
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,519
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm not gonna eat him.

419
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,221
I'm a pescatarian.

420
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,689
The Order has retained
the services of a Corpse Eater

421
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,258
for situations such as this.

422
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,793
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no one is eating my body, okay?

423
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,262
I'm not fucking done
with it yet.

424
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,763
- Kind of a ticking
clock on this.

425
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,132
If the tether goes before
Penny's soul passes on,

426
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,500
he's right fucked.

427
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,136
The Corpse Eater needs
a tick to prepare.

428
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,672
She'll be here tomorrow
at sundown.

429
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,709
Oh, and you're welcome.

430
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:37,717
.

431
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,518
- The ghost children
at the Plover house

432
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,453
couldn't be saved.

433
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,322
But Penny still has his tether.

434
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,556
- I'm not a ghost!

435
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,425
- If he's a ghost,
shouldn't he be,

436
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,295
I don't--I don't know,
haunting us?

437
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,496
What if something else
happened?

438
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,698
- Yes,
something else did happen!

439
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,567
- It can take decades for
a spirit to become malevolent.

440
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,370
Corpse Eaters
are a rare creature.

441
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,439
If the Librarians
actually have one,

442
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,310
not just some sicko
who wants a free meal,

443
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,711
you should use it.

444
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,879
- But what if there's
a way to fix him?

445
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,749
To bring him back?

446
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,351
- Without magic?

447
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,286
- Julia has magic.

448
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,223
Okay, not much, but I--

449
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,959
It's just, I--I--
I can't wrap my head around

450
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,396
sending him to work for the
Library for a billion years.

451
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,398
I don't trust them.

452
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,367
- There you go.
Come on, Kady.

453
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,269
- The Underworld's not so bad.

454
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,504
Quentin says there's
a bowling alley.

455
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,807
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

456
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,975
- Damn it, Alice.

457
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,744
I thought we were bros.

458
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,880
- Aah, let go, let go, let go!

459
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,715
My God!

460
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,684
I was only trying
to follow the story.

461
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,488
- No, what Julia does
in the bath is not story!

462
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,424
- It is revealing...
of character.

463
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:55,628
- Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

464
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,596
Okay?

465
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,432
Now, I don't give a shit
if it didn't end well

466
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,433
for you in the past.

467
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,734
You are going to help me.

468
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:05,805
Or I will cock block you
for the rest of time.

469
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,640
- Okay.

470
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,782
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

471
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,851
I spent months trying
to push things.

472
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,387
I never got anywhere.

473
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,723
Until I tried being the thing.

474
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,928
Uh...
[blows through lips]

475
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,830
Okay, focus on a penny.

476
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,366
Ha ha, get it?
'Cause of your name?

477
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,734
You get it.

478
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,603
Now, you're not gonna try
to move the penny.

479
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,439
You're gonna try to be it.

480
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:43,376
So--so pour yourself
into its shape.

481
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,313
Inhabit it
with your whole being.

482
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,747
Hmm?

483
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,416
Go ahead.

484
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,883
Be the penny.
- Okay.

485
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,452
I got this.

486
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,787
- Be the penny.

487
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,557
Just be the goddamn penny!

488
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,625
Penny, just be it!
- [stammering]

489
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,992
What does that even mean?

490
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,395
- You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

491
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,430
Maybe we should have started
with a nickel.

492
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,431
- Wha--
- Huh?

493
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,865
Be the nickel!

494
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,067
- Maybe you shouldn't say
the same dumb shit

495
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,337
over and over!
- Oh!

496
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,605
I'm sorry,
but you're a dullard!

497
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,607
A real dunce, I say!

498
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,043
You are worth less
than a penny,

499
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,911
and a penny is worthless!

500
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,046
- [screams]

501
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,583
Um...

502
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,784
This is weird.

503
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,019
- [gasps]
You are the Penny.

504
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,989
- What do I do now?
I can't move.

505
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,958
- Well, how could you?
You don't have any feet.

506
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,761
- [grunts and groans]

507
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,763
- What are you--
what are you doing?

508
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,030
It sounds like you're pooping.

509
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,366
- [grunts]

510
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,000
- Holy zerts!
You did it!

511
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,637
[laughs]
- [gagging]

512
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,508
I still have the taste
of pennies in my mouth.

513
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,112
Wait, why--why don't I--

514
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,015
Why don't I just project myself
into my own body?

515
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,484
I know how to be that.

516
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,018
- The only reason
you're still alive

517
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,854
is because you were Astral
Projecting when you died.

518
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,090
So if you go back
into your corpse,

519
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,626
you'll just be...dead.

520
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,829
- I need something bigger.

521
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,599
I need something
that can talk.

522
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,066
- Yeah, uh, hey, be careful.

523
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,638
Controlling things with brains
is much harder.

524
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:22,509
- Be the bunny.

525
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,743
Be the bunny.

526
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,713
Be the bunny.
- It won't work.

527
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,017
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

528
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,654
with a few days' time
out on Eliot's party boat?

529
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,690
- Your Majesty,
upon our return to Whitespire,

530
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:42,161
might I suggest a hot bath
to relax yourself?

531
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:48,067
- I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

532
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,803
I keep waiting for Eliot
to come back.

533
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,939
But maybe he never will.

534
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,975
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

535
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,712
For all I know, he's dead.

536
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,850
And him and Penny are blowing
each other in Heaven.

537
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,120
Now, when I get back...

538
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,825
I'm gonna fix this.

539
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,062
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

540
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,065
Tick, you're gonna go to that
fairy-repelling hallway

541
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,968
and you're gonna grind one
of those bricks to dust.

542
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,705
You're gonna put it in
the Fairy Queen's bath...

543
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,041
and when that knocks her
on her ass...

544
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,110
I'm gonna cut out her heart
and eat it

545
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,881
in front of every goddamn Fairy
asshole in the Kingdom.

546
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:39,018
- Damn.
Girl, you get shit done.

547
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,628
[groans]

548
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,699
And I thought Hyman
was a perv.

549
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,709
Be the Margolem.

550
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,178
Be the Margolem.

551
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,250
- Uh, um,
um, announcement.

552
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,586
You guys remember the Margolem?

553
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,755
Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

554
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,758
Since Margo's been gone,
I've been storing it.

555
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,259
You know, for safekeeping?

556
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,260
- Eww.

557
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,261
- That's problematic.

558
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,763
- It's not like that.

559
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,933
I just dress her up
and pretend she respects me.

560
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,036
Anyways, she's been out
of commission since magic died,

561
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,037
only...

562
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,138
- [groans]

563
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,674
- She woke up.

564
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,276
- Fuck.

565
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,981
- [groans]

566
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,049
- [grunts]

567
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,090
- [yells]
- [screams]

568
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:55,127
[screaming]

569
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,197
[screams]

570
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,934
- I told you
it wouldn't end well.

571
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,804
- You know,
I wish you weren't dead

572
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,539
so I could kill you.

573
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,174
- So, this Margolem
must've had

574
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,043
some residual magic
left in her.

575
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,579
- Or the living clay
she was made of

576
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,080
was a magical creature?

577
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,982
Uh, anyway,
while we have you here,

578
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,284
we found Lance Morrison's
Breakbill records.

579
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,754
Um, it says that he was only
a student for a semester.

580
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:23,956
But it also says
in this file that he left

581
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,191
because of a "code seven."

582
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,193
- Student suicide.

583
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,294
Or he magically exploded.

584
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,130
I don't know why they use
the same damn code for both.

585
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,100
- Okay, either way,
he died on campus.

586
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,035
So the key might still
be here, right?

587
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,670
- But it says he was living
in the West Dorm,

588
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:38,938
and there is no such thing,
so...

589
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,072
- That's because it's buried.

590
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,141
- Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

591
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,242
- In the late 1940s,

592
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,878
there was a haunting
in the West Dorm.

593
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,814
At the time,
it was considered bad form

594
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,882
to have a ghost on campus.

595
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,119
Unlike today, where we put it
in the goddamn brochure.

596
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,589
- "That ghost"
is gonna kill them.

597
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,890
To death, Penny.

598
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,959
- So, the Dean buried
the whole dorm.

599
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,861
Magically protected
the entrances

600
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,129
so that students
couldn't find it.

601
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,565
- But magic is gone.
So we can walk right in.

602
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,701
Right?

603
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,069
- What are you gonna do?

604
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,203
- Nothing.

605
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,005
It's not my problem.

606
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,608
- They're your friends.
- Who I can't help in any way.

607
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,143
You go figure some shit out.

608
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,713
- [scoffs]
I'm not going down there.

609
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,281
- What are you scared of?

610
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,616
You're dead already.

611
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,952
- You're so dumb, Penny.

612
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,355
Ghosts can hurt
whatever it is we are.

613
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,057
That one in the West dorm?

614
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,826
Terrorized me for a week.

615
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,294
- Wait a minute.

616
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,832
If they can hurt us, then--
then they can see us.

617
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:43,369
[spooky music]

618
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:50,810

619
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,889
- Hey.
Q.

620
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,357
*

621
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:08,327
[door hinge creaks]

622
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,663
*

623
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:11,664
- All right.

624
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:18,170
*

625
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,807
Um, excuse me.

626
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,709
Lance Morrison?

627
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:23,743
- Who are you?

628
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,211
Did my father send you?

629
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,346
You can tell him I am not
coming home for winter.

630
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,916
- Hey, ghost boy.

631
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,383
We need to talk.

632
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:34,286
.

633
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,421
- You need to tell them that
Penny is in the room with them.

634
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,691
- What are you talking about?

635
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:39,692
- Um...
- Well...

636
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:41,193
- No, I am not a bitch!

637
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,229
- Well, we don't think that.
- Right, no, of course.

638
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,232
Do you know anything
about a golden key

639
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,335
that maybe your friend
Rupert Chatwin gave you?

640
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,903
- Rupert?

641
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:54,073
[electricity buzzes]

642
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,308
- This place
is quite something.

643
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,745
- Nothing compared
to where you've been.

644
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,114
- He's in a ghost loop.

645
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,215
He's not even listening to us.

646
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,084
- I brought you something.

647
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,720
From Fillory.
Here.

648
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,188
Take it.

649
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,422
It won't hurt.

650
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:14,026
It just reveals the honest
truth of things.

651
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,962
Shows them as they truly are.

652
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:26,105
*

653
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,907
- I see.

654
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,744
*

655
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:33,846
- [laughs]
Damn it, Hyman.

656
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,482
This isn't terrifying.
It's just two dudes kissing.

657
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,484
You homophobic pussy.

658
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,986
[electricity buzzes]

659
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,421
- Lance Morrison.

660
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,190
You've been speaking
out of turn

661
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,292
about your mother's family.

662
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,828
You have sullied
the McAllistair name.

663
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,162
- All I did
was tell the truth.

664
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:53,766
- Truth can bury us.

665
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,534
- It's the key.

666
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,303
It's ruined everything.

667
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,538
- Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt
this little father-son moment,

668
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,241
but could someone please
just say the words,

669
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,811
"Penny is in the room"?

670
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:07,746
- Say it isn't true.
- Okay.

671
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,017
- You can't control yourself.

672
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,853
Don't blame the key
for your perversion.

673
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:14,486
[grunts]

674
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,388
- Whoa, dude!

675
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,057
Whoa!

676
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,326
*

677
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,763
- [choking]

678
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,368
- The key's in the dad's
pocket.

679
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:33,005
*

680
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,274
- I think he just...

681
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,143
- Oh, shit.

682
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,045
- [grunting]

683
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:42,949
[both grunting]

684
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,184
- I tried being nice.

685
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,919
You will say my name.

686
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,055
You say my name,
you ghost dick!

687
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:51,057
- What is your name?

688
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,424
That's not a name!

689
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,559
No, it isn't!

690
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,027
[screaming]
No, it isn't!

691
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,029
- Uh, Q?

692
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,198
I think we might have
broken this ride.

693
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,432
- No!

694
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:07,840
*

695
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,480
- The Library
has a Corpse Eater

696
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,815
that can help take him
to the Underworld.

697
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,485
- What's she saying?

698
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,954
What--What--
Fuck, stop signing!

699
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,956
- Burn his body.
- Burn his body?

700
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,424
- Oh, hell no.

701
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,393
- Then he'll be stuck there
for eternity,

702
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,396
turning into a ghost,
or--or worse.

703
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,932
- She says,
"Better than a slave

704
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,067
"to the people
who killed him.

705
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,035
For a billion years."

706
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,037
- Am I the only one that
knows that eternity

707
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,072
is a lot longer
than a billion years?

708
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,875
- [groans]

709
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,044
- Lance said his mom
was a McAllistair.

710
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,613
- Well, that would explain
how he got into Brakebills.

711
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:50,082
The McAllistairs are
on the Board of Trustees.

712
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:53,152
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

713
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,386
- Lance's father held the key.

714
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,188
I mean, he knew
how powerful it was.

715
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,423
That it would reveal truth.

716
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,491
It would show things
that were hidden.

717
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,160
So, he would have kept it.

718
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,662
Except that he would have
died by now, so--

719
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,032
- Wait, could you get us
into that house?

720
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,499
- Maybe.

721
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,136
Irene McAllistair's been
calling me every day

722
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,071
looking for a lead on magic.

723
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,205
[chuckles]

724
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,374
Perhaps if we could
give her something

725
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,909
that she really wants.

726
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,446
- Hey, have you been
paying attention

727
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,480
to Quentin's stupid key thing?

728
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,481
- [scoffs]
Have I?

729
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,116
- Yeah, great, shut up.

730
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,485
The ghost said it has
the power to reveal things

731
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,920
that are hidden.

732
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,456
I'm a hidden thing.

733
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,124
- [gasps]
Twist.

734
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:34,660
- Okay, tonight it'll be
seven days since I died.

735
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,462
If I don't contact Kady today,

736
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,364
she is either gonna
burn my corpse,

737
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,566
or worse,
give it to the Library.

738
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,068
I'm not getting eaten.

739
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,070
- You know, Q said
Eliot already found

740
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,504
one of those keys.

741
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,173
- Okay, simple plan.

742
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:50,309
We use the key to make
a Shadow Bat monster illusion

743
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,710
like that priest did
on that island.

744
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,480
We scare away the bad men,
we get to a book chute,

745
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,315
we find a door,
and we get the hell out.

746
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,483
- Okay.
- Okay.

747
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:03,055
*

748
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,523
- Please tell me
you can see me.

749
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:09,328
*

750
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,329
Jesus.

751
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,064
- Holy moly.

752
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,232
*

753
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,466
What have I done?

754
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,569
- Eliot, what the hell
are you wearing?

755
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,638
- Hi...Dad.

756
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:22,508
.

757
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,242
- Hi, Dad.
- This is your father?

758
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,577
- Hi, Grandpa.

759
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,181
- What is with everyone
and their daddy issues today?

760
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:30,549
- Dressed like that,
everyone's gonna know

761
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,551
you haven't worked
a day in your life.

762
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:33,652
- It's just an illusion.

763
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,054
- I didn't think you could make

764
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,755
a sailor's uniform
look gayer.

765
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,757
- My God.
- It's just an illusion.

766
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,460
- Eliot, you might be the only
person in the multiverse

767
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:42,694
more fucked than me.

768
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,063
- You're just an illusion.

769
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,531
- I wish I could help.

770
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,071
- Henry.
- How are you?

771
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:55,374
- Oh, it is so good to see you!
- [chuckles]

772
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,576
- I was so happy
when you called.

773
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,412
- Yeah.
Irene, these are my students.

774
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,081
- Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

775
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,116
Come on in.
[chuckles]

776
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,585
[clears throat]

777
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,093
- Okay, there's some real
"Beauty and the Beast"

778
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,527
kind of stuff happening here.

779
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,197
- I don't understand.
How is that possible?

780
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,066
- Well, the house's
enchantments run

781
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,103
on a reserve of energy that my
father built up over decades.

782
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,572
When he was a child,
there was a blackout

783
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,140
that lasted for months.

784
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,675
So he wanted to be prepared.

785
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,411
Please, come.
Follow me.

786
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,314
Unfortunately,
they won't last.

787
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,250
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

788
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:41,320
Which is why I was so intrigued
by your call, Henry.

789
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,654
- Mmm.

790
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,790
- Would you like a martini?

791
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,292
Martini!

792
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,659
[shaking]

793
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,399
- Um, can I get
an olive in mine, please?

794
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,270
- Thank you.

795
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:01,673
- Thank you.

796
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:07,346
- So, which one of you
can do magic?

797
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,516
- Um...

798
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,452
Well, I, um...

799
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:17,523
So, before I knew about magic,
real magic,

800
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,326
I--I used to do a lot
of sleight of hand tricks.

801
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:25,597
So, it turns out that
I wasn't very good at it.

802
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:31,203
Um, I was cheating, um,
by using translocation spells

803
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,638
without really knowing it.

804
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:39,445
Uh, I don't know why, but, um,
those tricks still work.

805
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,047
- Or you have a squished olive
in your pocket.

806
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,486
[chuckles]

807
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,787
Fascinating.

808
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,622
Not at all useful, but, uh...

809
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,790
- I can do more.

810
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,892
Um, do you have
a deck of cards?

811
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,362
- [clears throat]
Uh, excuse me.

812
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,829
Where's your restroom?

813
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:01,133
[dramatic music]

814
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:08,374
*

815
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,614
[snaps]

816
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,916
- Holy shit.

817
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,653
[gasping]

818
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,423
*

819
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,264
- I'm sorry, Penny.

820
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:35,767
It's been six and a half days.

821
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,670
Time's up.

822
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:45,744
*

823
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,325
- Come on.

824
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,828
*

825
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,563
Come on, find it!

826
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,965
*

827
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,567
Come on!

828
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,770
*

829
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,605
Damn it.

830
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:20,679
*

831
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,782
- Kady, wait.

832
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,353
I just need more time.

833
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,361
- It's not too late.
- [gasps]

834
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,663
- Corpse Eater'll be here
any minute.

835
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,966
- Honestly, why do you care?

836
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,336
- He was my friend.

837
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,338
- He wasn't one of you.

838
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,741
- You're right.
I barely knew Penny.

839
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,276
*

840
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,477
I don't know where he was from,

841
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:26,912
I don't know about his family,

842
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:30,416
I don't know--I don't know
how he found magic.

843
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,817
*

844
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,053
But I know what it's like
to be trapped

845
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,924
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

846
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,426
*

847
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,028
But in the Underworld,

848
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,996
he still gets to be Penny.

849
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,399
- Dammit, Alice,
I'm still me.

850
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:51,837
- It took everything I had

851
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,305
to try to save his life.

852
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,074
*

853
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,944
And then...

854
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,412
he died anyway.

855
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,713
*

856
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,950
And then, I--
and then I was relieved.

857
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,084
To be done.

858
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,388
*

859
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,423
If Penny was here...

860
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,559
*

861
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,027
If he could tell us
what he wanted...

862
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,664
*

863
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:19,665
But he's not.

864
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,567
- Okay, look,
they're both terrible options,

865
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,335
but if I had to choose,

866
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,371
please don't send me
to the Underworld.

867
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,673
*

868
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,108
- I know you don't want
the responsibility.

869
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,010
*

870
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,445
So don't take it.

871
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:36,081
*

872
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,383
Let me.

873
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,451
*

874
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,752
- No, Kady, please.

875
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:45,824
*

876
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,693
Be the candle.

877
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,996
Be the candle.

878
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,631
- I'll go get the Corpse Eater.

879
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,736
[rumbling]

880
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,740
[fire flaring]

881
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,609
- Penny...

882
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:13,919
.

883
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:14,586
- That's uncomfortable to hold.

884
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,491
It makes me feel like...

885
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:22,060
I don't know,
like I'm not really myself.

886
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:26,865
- Okay, then I will...

887
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,468
pass on touching it.

888
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,070
Oh, uh,
I checked the book.

889
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,873
Uh, so, you unlocked
chapter three.

890
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:39,445
Um, and it looks like the--
the next key

891
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,546
might be in Fillary, maybe.

892
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,547
[door creaking]

893
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,548
Um...

894
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,549
[slamming]

895
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:44,783
- [clears throat]

896
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,418
- Dean Fogg.

897
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:47,653
- Good morning.

898
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:50,055
- Yeah.
It is the morning.

899
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,925
- Irene sent her apologies.

900
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,762
Our little show did not
convince her last night.

901
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:57,763
We're out of time.

902
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,431
As of this morning,

903
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,933
the Board of Directors
put Breakbills up for sale.

904
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,835
The school will be closed.

905
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,471
I'm out of a job.

906
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:06,972
And I'd say you're evicted,

907
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:11,443
but I have no idea who
actually owns this building.

908
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,582
Uh, Quentin,
is this Scotch or Rye?

909
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:19,585
- Uh, rum.
- Excellent.

910
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:22,688
Well, carry on.

911
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,189
I'm going to go lie down.

912
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,996
- Well, look at it this way.

913
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,000
Uh, now we've both been kicked
out of Breakbills, so...

914
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,702
we've got that in common.

915
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:40,572
[crowd shouting]

916
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,107
- Holy shit.

917
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,910
[panting]

918
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,615
Thank Christ.
- Eliot?

919
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,983
- Hey.
- How did you--

920
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,019
Hey.

921
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,754
- Can I please have some water?

922
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,524
- Yeah, sure.
- Sparkling, please.

923
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,598
Gather 'round.

924
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:11,069
Story time with Uncle Eliot.

925
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,140
This story is called...

926
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:18,610
"Eliot did nothing wrong
but was chased by cannibals

927
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:21,012
through the befucked
Neitherlands anyway."

928
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,213
- Sorry, who's this?

929
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,816
- Oh, right, yeah.
Meet Fray.

930
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,051
Our daughter.

931
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,953
- I'm sorr--your--
Wait, your daughter?

932
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,822
- Please, hold your questions
till the end.

933
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:36,061
So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

934
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,564
Naturally, I resolved
to use the key,

935
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,932
which, in Fillory,
created illusions

936
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,601
of a terrifying monster.

937
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,902
- He made his father instead.

938
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,203
- No spoilers.

939
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:48,039
But, yeah.
What she said.

940
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,008
Turns out the key
creates illusions

941
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,209
of what you most fear.

942
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,811
Hence...

943
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,112
My dad.

944
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,315
I told my father that
the guys in the tent

945
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,685
didn't know the difference
between a tractor

946
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:00,886
and a backhoe.

947
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:04,089
So he went to
set them straight.

948
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,559
- You saying you--
you fed your--

949
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:09,027
your dad to cannibals?

950
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,764
- An illusion of him.
But yes.

951
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:14,299
It was very cathartic.

952
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,135
There was lots of screaming
on both sides.

953
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,206
But we snuck right past them.

954
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:24,142
- We found a key, too.

955
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,977
- Oh.
- Um...

956
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:28,046
- We've been--We've been
calling it the truth key

957
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,015
'cause it--well,
it reveals truths.

958
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,050
- Truths.
- I can handle a little truth.

959
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,053
[dramatic music]

960
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,789
*

961
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,024
I don't know.

962
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,659
I don't see anything.

963
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,861
Maybe it doesn't work on me.

964
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:43,929
Oh, hey, Penny.

965
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,163
- Wai--
