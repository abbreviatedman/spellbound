00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,559
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,298
Q, I think this is it. The
Tale of the Seven Keys.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,839
Jules, this is our quest.

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,936
Was there always a
keyhole right there?

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,040
The eye can never be fixed.

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,605
But you can't spy on me anymore.

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,708
You have a week's
sail back to Whitespire

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,412
to think about what you've done.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,783
Alice!

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,056
I'm sorry. You
called me too late.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,188
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. He can't.

12
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,692
No, come on, Pen.
Don't, don't, come on.

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,700
No. Shit.

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,641
What the fuck is happening?

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,401
We have to do something.

16
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,471
Do something!

17
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,940
Kady.

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,744
Kady, he's gone.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,907
No.

20
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,822
Kady. Kady, I'm right...

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,165
You need to hear me.

22
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,101
I was astral projecting.

23
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,138
I wasn't in my body
when I died... It died.

24
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,431
Damn it!

25
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:18,771
Damn it.

26
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,849
Damn it!

27
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,254
Q. Hey.

28
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,182
Hey, I... What's wrong?

29
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,820
Um... It's... It's Penny.

30
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,642
Oh, come on.

31
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,205
I'm sorry. Do you
ever have, like,

32
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,148
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't...

33
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,185
Um...

34
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,425
Why is nobody crying?

35
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,599
I saved all your
asses so many times.

36
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,833
Appreciate me!

37
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:29,241
Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

38
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,745
Yes?

39
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,417
Okay, um, yeah.

40
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,221
We're here today
to remember the life

41
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,889
of a friend and student.

42
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,560
William Penny Adi...

43
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,159
Adi, uh...

44
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,197
I don't really know how to
pronounce his last name.

45
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,537
It's Adiyodi. Idiot.

46
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,940
Penny was complicated.

47
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,502
And I think he
probably hated me.

48
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,444
But, um...

49
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,045
None of us really knew him.

50
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,084
Not even me.

51
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,846
That's how he wanted it.

52
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,652
So, uh...

53
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,861
All I can really say is, uh...

54
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,439
I am so screwed.

55
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,664
Okay, come on.

56
00:03:58,772 --> 00:03:59,967
Damn it.

57
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,008
Yo.

58
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,075
Bodi, you down there?

59
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,312
Shep!

60
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,478
I found one of them
soft ones you like.

61
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,920
Don't burn it.

62
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,250
Oh. The vellum
feels nice on my ass.

63
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,954
No, no, no, no, no. I need that.

64
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,423
I got a surprise for you, too.

65
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,497
Fresh meat upstairs.

66
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,827
What's it been?

67
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,891
Two weeks since we
caught the librarian?

68
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,497
Not much left but gristle.

69
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,032
You ate a librarian?

70
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,904
Hi, there.

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,809
Eliot? Hello, kind strangers.

72
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,681
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

73
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,186
That's a bad move, Eliot.

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,915
What brought you
to the Neitherlands?

75
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,622
Family vacation.

76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,817
No, I mean...

77
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,922
We got here using magic beans.

78
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,893
We used a magic key. - Right.

79
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:59,455
But there's no magic
now, so, um, we're stuck.

80
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,328
Like you? That's right.

81
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,493
Fountains are all frozen over.

82
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,833
We haven't eaten in days.

83
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:05,929
Right. Um...

84
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,875
If you had an extra
sandwich or something...

85
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,673
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

86
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,907
Have a seat. Thank you.

87
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,539
No, no, no. No, Eliot, don't!

88
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,742
They're cannibals!

89
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,182
Oh, God.

90
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,896
Thank you. PENNY:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,548
No, that's... Don't eat that.

92
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,220
No, don't eat that, please.

93
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,849
You're eating a dude!
Mmm. It's not bad.

94
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,827
Man, seriously, fuck this place!

95
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,588
I can't believe that he's gone.

96
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,025
I mean, we were
never really that close.

97
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,036
But I don't know, I...

98
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,533
I loved him, I think.

99
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,211
It's just... How come
you never really know

100
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,746
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

101
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,520
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

102
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,682
What?

103
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,189
I loved that.

104
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,351
Were you close with your dad?

105
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
Oh.

106
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,225
For fuck's sake.

107
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,399
I saw him a few weeks ago.

108
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,230
It's crazy. Um...

109
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,905
The cancer that
he had was sort of

110
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,071
inherently magical,

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,006
so magic went away, and...

112
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,742
He's, like, in remission.

113
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,950
Sorry. I didn't mean to, uh...

114
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,749
No, it's good. It's good.

115
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,119
It's the one good thing
to come out of this.

116
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,736
I didn't know when I
was gonna see you again.

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,228
I had nowhere else to go.

118
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,660
After the burial, I can't be in
the same room as my mom.

119
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,490
I mean, we could use your help.

120
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,629
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back...

121
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,330
Honestly, I don't
think we should.

122
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,999
Okay, I don't really know
where to begin with that.

123
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,169
But, I mean, for
starters, I mean,

124
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,769
this is... This is our quest.

125
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,246
I sort of feel like
we were elected.

126
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,943
It's magic. Jesus, Alice, I...

127
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,451
You turn it back on, what
happens to your dad?

128
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,655
Sometimes I want magic back

129
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,418
more than anything.

130
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,755
And sometimes I just...

131
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,025
I look around and see
what a mess we made with it.

132
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,632
Right now I just wanna be 23,

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,468
and not know what I want,

134
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,333
and not know what I'm doing.

135
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,496
Yeah.

136
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,370
Oh, God.

137
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,813
I just remembered,
I have to tell

138
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,477
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

139
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,779
How? Aren't they in Fillory?

140
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,355
What are you doing?

141
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,971
That was super weird.

142
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,554
Your Majesty, if
you would prefer,

143
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,071
we can put into harbor
at Broken Bay instead.

144
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,083
When did you get
this sweet boat?

145
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,684
Man.

146
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,021
I miss all the cool shit.

147
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,522
We don't have a choice.

148
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,017
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

149
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,219
the Fairy Queen will fly in

150
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,057
on the back of some
whimsical animal,

151
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,754
and she'll slit our
throats, or worse.

152
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,659
A messenger bunny, Your Majesty.

153
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,171
Penny's dead. Sorry.

154
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,275
Penny's dead?

155
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,403
Was he not already?

156
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,908
What?

157
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,575
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

158
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,784
Finally!

159
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,421
He was my best friend.

160
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,284
Okay, I mean, all right.

161
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,859
I guess I always thought

162
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,621
someday we were gonna bang.

163
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,861
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

164
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,395
You know, I... I thought
we'd have normal problems.

165
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,098
Like, I'd look at other
girls, and you'd get mad.

166
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,299
Or you'd tell me a
story for the third time,

167
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,400
and we'd realize we
have nothing left to say.

168
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,105
But we don't get
normal problems.

169
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,277
I know what you're
looking for. Don't.

170
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,213
This is stupid.

171
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,449
What do you think
this is gonna solve?

172
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,892
You can't hear a word I say.

173
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,129
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

174
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,328
if I can't do a damn
thing about it, so...

175
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,740
I'm gonna go.

176
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,437
Try and find some
way to fix this.

177
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,815
Goodbye, Kady.

178
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,318
Julia.

179
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,954
Help her. Now.

180
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,925
What? The hell?

181
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,191
You're the only one who can.

182
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,971
What? What happened?

183
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,876
Oh, fuck.

184
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,672
Jesus. Kady!

185
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,782
Kady, come on!

186
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,984
Um...

187
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,413
Kady...

188
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,984
Come on!

189
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,193
Come on. Please, Kady.

190
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,832
Wake up.

191
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,665
Okay. Okay.

192
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,532
Okay, baby.

193
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,834
Okay.

194
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,668
Holy shit, that was gross.

195
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,745
What?

196
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,977
You can see me?

197
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,080
You can see me?

198
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,690
Hey, what's your deal? Sorry.

199
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,996
It's just, you're talking to me,

200
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,258
and not through me,

201
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,391
and that's kind of huge, Penny.

202
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,524
How do you know my name?

203
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,160
Well, I've been watching you

204
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,262
and your friends
since you got here.

205
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,105
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

206
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,876
Hyman? Mmm-hmm.

207
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,905
Did that mean something
different when you were born?

208
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,014
Wait, you haven't heard of me?

209
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:26,049
The Pervert Ghost of Brakebills?

210
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,053
I was a student
here in the 1920s.

211
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,522
A Traveler, like you.

212
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,722
I would practice astral
projection around the campus.

213
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,562
You know, pop into
lectures, the dormitories,

214
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,729
showers, you know how it is.

215
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,131
Uh... No. And as a prank,

216
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,896
someone moved
my body while I was...

217
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,098
Being a fucking pervert.

218
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:50,270
And, yes, in their defense, I
was given several warnings.

219
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,242
But I never found my body.

220
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,408
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

221
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,248
It must have died
without me in it.

222
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,754
That's a bummer.
Well, joke's on them.

223
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,050
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

224
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,058
So it's all peeping,
all the time.

225
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,618
You know you're
not a ghost, right?

226
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,124
Wha... I'm not?

227
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,630
You were on the astral
plane when you died.

228
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,759
So was I.

229
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,427
Our minds were traveling.

230
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,062
Now they have no
place to go back to.

231
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,471
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

232
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,305
so they relive their
death over and over.

233
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,673
Are you doing that?

234
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,313
People can see ghosts.

235
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,280
Ghosts can touch things.

236
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,785
I know, 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

237
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,979
and it wasn't great.

238
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,248
We can't do that.

239
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,313
Okay, Professor, then how come

240
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,721
I can sit in a chair?

241
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,590
Why am I not
just falling forever?

242
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,129
I don't know. I
don't make the rules.

243
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,664
Your ass just knows.

244
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,962
Look, didn't you
figure all this shit out

245
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,127
100 years ago when you died?

246
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,966
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

247
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:55,133
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive-ish?

248
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,370
Believe me, I tried everything.

249
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,873
For years.

250
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,807
It did not end well.

251
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,192
What do you
mean, it didn't end...

252
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,878
Shh. Shut up.

253
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,213
Shut up.

254
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,978
Hey. Hey.

255
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,148
How's Kady?

256
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,816
Sleeping it off
in the infirmary.

257
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,659
How did you know to
knock down her door?

258
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,663
Just a feeling. Okay.

259
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,358
They're my favorite pairing.

260
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,990
The tension between them.

261
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,662
Friends for years, but
he's always loved her.

262
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,501
You're in a bit of a
research K-Hole here.

263
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,404
Yeah. It's cool.

264
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,707
It just reminds me of me.

265
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,411
So, the second key...
So, the knight's daughter,

266
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,505
she found it in a sentient cave

267
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,049
that just kept
asking her riddles,

268
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,694
and wouldn't let her in
until it deemed her worthy.

269
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,050
It was very patronizing. Wait.

270
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,485
Why does that sound familiar?

271
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,855
Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

272
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,224
in the first Fillory book,
<i>The World in the Walls.</i>

273
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,388
He was being chased by
a belligerent cassowary.

274
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,522
I remember. Right. Um...

275
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,693
So he finds this
mountain of treasure,

276
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,168
but only takes one item.

277
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,568
A golden key.

278
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,764
To bring to his friend.

279
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,397
Right, that he
met during the war.

280
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,703
So, look, if this story is real,

281
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,711
and he actually
did give him the key,

282
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,871
then I... I...

283
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,438
Jules, I think the
key is here on Earth.

284
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,384
Seriously?

285
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,611
These two?

286
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,416
You and Kady are great.

287
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,957
I totally ship that.

288
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,888
Alice is okay.

289
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,619
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

290
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,561
You know? I don't
get that reference.

291
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,265
Oh, Josh is my idol.

292
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,627
That man is a Vagician.

293
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,762
But Quentin, I mean,

294
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,707
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

295
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,907
As someone born in 1902,

296
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,944
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

297
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:48,421
Anyway, Quentin
is the duck's nuts.

298
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,617
No, that cannot be a
real thing people said.

299
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,420
So we should send
a message to Eliot.

300
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,325
Shit. Eliot.

301
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,759
Oh, my God.

302
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,802
Cannibals! They're cannibals!

303
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,131
I told you!

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Oh, my God.

305
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,239
They made me

306
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,805
eat a person.

307
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,602
We should make a deal with them.

308
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,772
No.

309
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,941
You can't negotiate
with cannibals.

310
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,484
You can't give
them what they want.

311
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,986
Well, can't we? No!

312
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,484
You're grounded.

313
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,282
We need to find
a way out of here.

314
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,668
On the <i>Muntjac,</i> the
key created the door

315
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,160
out of nowhere
when we needed it.

316
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,287
I don't see any doors or
places a door could be.

317
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,592
Downstairs in the Library!

318
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,524
You lied about the key.

319
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,996
They lied first.

320
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,646
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

321
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,536
No, you lied to me.

322
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,172
You were never collecting taxes.

323
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,119
Uh, can we have this talk
when we're not being hunted

324
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,009
by cannibals?
What is the key for?

325
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,876
Fray! What does it really do?

326
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,176
It doesn't fucking matter
if we can't find a door.

327
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,452
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

328
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,714
No shit!

329
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,999
I think, there are cannibals
sitting on the only entry point.

330
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,150
Wait, they're coming!

331
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,022
Run, run, run!

332
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,658
Slow down! I have wooden toes!

333
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,889
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

334
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,829
Hyman, where have you been?

335
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,213
I went with them
to solve the mystery

336
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,865
of Rupert's golden key.

337
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,405
Who cares?

338
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,237
If they find all
seven keys, Penny,

339
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,367
then...

340
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,908
Something good happens?

341
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,573
I missed a bit.

342
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,341
So the seven keys

343
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,217
from the story unlock magic?

344
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,516
Oh, that's...

345
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,081
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

346
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:36,094
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

347
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,229
in World War II.

348
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,594
His name was Lance Morrison.

349
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,395
And it turns out
that after the war,

350
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,528
Lance went to a magic school.

351
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,038
Brakebills. JULIA: Right.

352
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,269
So if there are any
records from the late 1940s,

353
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,541
maybe that can
help us find the key.

354
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,103
My assistant's file
cabinet, bottom drawer.

355
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,442
Thank you.

356
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,444
Pardon the interruption.
Can I help you?

357
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,181
Wait a minute. I know that guy.

358
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,450
I certainly hope you can.

359
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,081
I'm here on behalf of The Order.

360
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,127
At the Library formerly
headquartered in the Neitherlands?

361
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,563
We need to talk about Penny.

362
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,698
Sorry to be blunt,

363
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,864
but did Penny die
a traumatic death?

364
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,042
Dean Fogg said you
were the one to ask.

365
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,306
Yes, it was traumatic.

366
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,340
That explains it.

367
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,410
Penny signed a
contract with The Order,

368
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,477
guaranteeing his
services in this life

369
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,146
and, well, beyond.

370
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,314
Curiously, his soul
never reported for service

371
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,449
to our Underworld branch.

372
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Then where is he?

373
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,061
I'm right here.

374
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,828
Likely in the process of
becoming a vengeful spirit.

375
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,125
Best to nip that in the
bud before his time is up.

376
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,293
What do you mean?

377
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,546
The soul is tethered to the body

378
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,061
for seven days after death.

379
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,335
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

380
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,773
and send him on his way.

381
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,835
How? Eat him, naturally.

382
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,947
Sweetheart, I'm
not gonna eat him.

383
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,278
I'm a pescatarian.

384
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,228
The Order has retained
the services of a corpse eater

385
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,618
for situations such as this.

386
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,282
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no
one is eating my body, okay?

387
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,636
I'm not fucking
done with it yet.

388
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,250
Kind of a ticking clock on this.

389
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,352
If the tether goes before
Penny's soul passes on,

390
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,622
he's right fucked.

391
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,289
The corpse eater
needs a tick to prepare.

392
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,858
She'll be here
tomorrow at sundown.

393
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,195
Oh, and you're welcome.

394
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,580
The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

395
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,342
But Penny still has his tether.

396
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,814
I'm not a ghost!

397
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,514
If he's a ghost,
shouldn't he be,

398
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,014
I don't... I don't
know, haunting us?

399
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,802
What if something else happened?

400
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,988
Yes, something else did happen!

401
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,826
It can take decades for a
spirit to become malevolent.

402
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,565
Corpse eaters
are a rare creature.

403
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,659
If the Librarians
actually have one,

404
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,968
not just some sicko
who wants a free meal,

405
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,007
you should use it.

406
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,537
But what if there's
a way to fix him?

407
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,806
To bring him back?

408
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,541
Without magic?

409
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,344
Julia has magic.

410
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,910
Okay, not much, but I...

411
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,316
It's just, I... I... I can't
wrap my head around

412
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,554
sending him to work for
the Library for a billion years.

413
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,588
I don't trust them.

414
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,561
There you go. Come on, Kady.

415
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,223
The Underworld's not so bad.

416
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,626
Quentin says there's
a bowling alley.

417
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,863
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

418
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,198
Damn it, Alice.

419
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,897
I thought we were bros.

420
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,034
Ah. Let go, let go, let go!

421
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,840
My God!

422
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,945
I was only trying
to follow the story.

423
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,712
No, what Julia does
in the bath is not story!

424
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,619
It is revealing of character.

425
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,090
Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

426
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,919
Okay?

427
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,621
Now, I don't give a
shit if it didn't end well

428
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,028
for you in the past. You
are going to help me.

429
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,861
Or I will cock block
you for the rest of time.

430
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,934
Okay.

431
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,073
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

432
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,979
I spent months
trying to push things.

433
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,443
I never got anywhere.

434
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,745
Until I tried being the thing.

435
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,649
Uh...

436
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,756
Okay, focus on a penny.

437
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,664
Get it? 'Cause of
your name? You get it.

438
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,661
Now, you're not gonna
try to move the penny.

439
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,400
You're gonna try to be it.

440
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,264
So pour yourself into its shape.

441
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,165
Inhabit it with
your whole being.

442
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,803
Hmm?

443
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,173
Go ahead.

444
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,908
Be the penny. Okay.

445
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,680
I got this.

446
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,611
Be the penny.

447
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,783
<i>Just be the goddamn penny!</i>

448
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,931
Penny, just be it!

449
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,321
What does that even mean?

450
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,585
You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

451
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,136
Maybe we should have
started with a nickel.

452
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,152
Wha... Huh? Be the nickel!

453
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,424
Maybe you shouldn't
say the same dumb shit

454
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,898
over and over!

455
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,662
Oh, I'm sorry, but
you're a dullard!

456
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,700
A real dunce, I say!

457
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,373
You are worth less than a penny,

458
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,964
and a penny is worthless!

459
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,278
Um...

460
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,041
This is weird.

461
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,379
You are the penny.

462
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,313
What do I do now? I can't move.

463
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,287
Well, how could you?
You don't have any feet.

464
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,025
What are you...
What are you doing?

465
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,326
It sounds like you're pooping.

466
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,689
Holy zerts! You did it!

467
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,466
Oh.

468
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,133
I still have the taste of
pennies in my mouth.

469
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,004
Wait, why... Why don't I...

470
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,345
Why don't I just project
myself into my own body?

471
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,675
I know how to be that.

472
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,340
The only reason
you're still alive

473
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,941
is because you were astral
projecting when you died.

474
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,414
So if you go back
into your corpse,

475
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,887
you'll just be dead.

476
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,157
I need something bigger.

477
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,555
I need something that can talk.

478
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,523
Yeah, hey, be careful.

479
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,428
Controlling things with
brains is much harder.

480
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,433
Be the bunny.

481
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,963
Be the bunny.

482
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,702
- Be the bunny.
- It won't work.

483
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,338
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

484
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,873
with a few days' time
out on Eliot's party boat?

485
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,921
Your Majesty, upon
our return to Whitespire,

486
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:39,516
might I suggest a hot
bath to relax yourself?

487
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:44,223
I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

488
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,059
I keep waiting for
Eliot to come back.

489
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,993
But maybe he never will.

490
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,270
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

491
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,966
For all I know, he's dead.

492
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,078
And him and Penny are
blowing each other in Heaven.

493
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,479
Now, when I get back...

494
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,252
I'm gonna fix this.

495
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,416
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

496
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,391
Tick, you're gonna go to
that fairy-repelling hallway

497
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,261
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

498
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,028
You're gonna put it in
the Fairy Queen's bath

499
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,631
and when that
knocks her on her ass,

500
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,430
I'm gonna cut out
her heart and eat it

501
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,739
in front of every goddamn
fairy asshole in the kingdom.

502
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,005
Damn. Girl, you get shit done.

503
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:50,053
And I thought Hyman was a perv.

504
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,467
Be the Margolem.

505
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,542
Be the Margolem.

506
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:08,611
Uh, um... Um, announcement.

507
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,775
You guys remember the Margolem?

508
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,977
Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

509
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,977
Since Margo's been
gone, I've been storing it.

510
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,614
You know, for safekeeping?

511
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,619
Ew. That's problematic.

512
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,990
It's not like that.

513
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,859
I just dress her up and
pretend she respects me.

514
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,326
Anyways, she's been out of
commission since magic died,

515
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,992
only...

516
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,804
She woke up.

517
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,632
Fuck.

518
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,210
I told you it wouldn't end well.

519
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,756
You know, I wish
you weren't dead

520
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,694
so I could kill you.

521
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,499
<i>So, this Margolem must've had</i>

522
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,302
some residual magic left in her.

523
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,377
Or the living clay she was
made of was a magical creature?

524
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,288
Uh, anyway, while
we have you here,

525
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,611
we found Lance
Morrison's Brakebill records.

526
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,775
Um... It says that he was
only a student for a semester.

527
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,213
But it also says in
this file that he left

528
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,515
because of a "code seven."

529
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:23,954
Student suicide.

530
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,888
Or he magically exploded.

531
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,120
I don't know why they use
the same damn code for both.

532
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,393
Okay, either way,
he died on campus.

533
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,295
So the key might
still be here, right?

534
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,909
But it says he was
living in the West Dorm,

535
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,213
and there is no
such thing, so...

536
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,348
That's because it's buried.

537
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,428
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

538
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,562
In the late 1940s,

539
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,108
there was a haunting
in the West Dorm.

540
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,040
At the time, it was
considered bad form

541
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,806
to have a ghost on campus.

542
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,410
Unlike today, where we put
it in the goddamn brochure.

543
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,452
"That ghost" is gonna kill them.

544
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,117
To death, Penny.

545
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,212
So, the Dean buried
the whole dorm.

546
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,087
Magically protected
the entrances

547
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,468
so that students
couldn't find it.

548
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,724
But magic is gone.
So we can walk right in.

549
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,897
Right?

550
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,091
What are you gonna do?

551
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,259
Nothing.

552
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,262
It's not my problem.

553
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,770
They're your friends.
Who I can't help in any way.

554
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,431
You go figure some shit out.

555
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,642
I'm not going down there.

556
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,467
What are you scared of?

557
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,637
You're dead already.

558
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,179
You're so dumb, Penny.

559
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,684
Ghosts can hurt
whatever it is we are.

560
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,651
That one in the West dorm?

561
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,019
Terrorized me for a week.

562
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,451
Wait a minute.

563
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,753
If they can hurt us, then...
Then they can see us.

564
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,809
Hey. Q.

565
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:08,893
All right.

566
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,996
Um... Excuse me.

567
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,595
Lance Morrison?

568
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,905
Who are you?

569
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,500
Did my father send you?

570
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,668
You can tell him I am not
coming home for winter.

571
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,075
Hey, ghost boy.

572
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,737
We need to talk.

573
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,185
You need to tell them that
Penny is in the room with them.

574
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,984
What are you talking about?

575
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,015
No, I am not a bitch!

576
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,060
Well, we don't think
that. Right, no, of course.

577
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,062
Do you know anything
about a golden key

578
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,190
that maybe your friend
Rupert Chatwin gave you?

579
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,626
Rupert?

580
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,031
This place is quite something.

581
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,037
Nothing compared
to where you've been.

582
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,905
He's in a ghost loop.

583
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,089
He's not even listening to us.

584
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,604
I brought you something.

585
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,110
From Fillory. Here.

586
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,616
Take it.

587
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,280
It won't hurt.

588
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,414
It just reveals the
honest truth of things.

589
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,756
Shows them as they truly are.

590
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,232
I see.

591
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,567
Damn it, Hyman.

592
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,374
This isn't terrifying. It's
just two dudes kissing.

593
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,381
You homophobic pussy.

594
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,279
Lance Morrison.

595
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,978
You've been speaking out of turn

596
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,680
about your mother's family.

597
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,419
You have sullied
the McAllistair name.

598
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,025
All I did was tell the truth.

599
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,320
Truth can bury us.

600
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,429
It's the key.

601
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,126
It's ruined everything.

602
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,474
Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt
this little father-son moment,

603
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,062
but could someone
please just say the words,

604
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,505
"Penny is in the room"?

605
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,134
Say it isn't true. Okay.

606
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,772
You can't control yourself.

607
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,578
Don't blame the key
for your perversion.

608
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,010
Whoa, dude!

609
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,480
Whoa!

610
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,196
The key's in the dad's pocket.

611
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,099
I think he just...

612
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,537
Oh, shit.

613
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:42,837
I tried being nice.

614
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,641
You will say my name.

615
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,810
You say my name, you ghost dick!

616
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,285
What is your name?

617
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,287
That's not a name!

618
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,448
No, it isn't!

619
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,752
No, it isn't!

620
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:53,985
Uh, Q?

621
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,988
I think we might
have broken this ride.

622
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,291
No!

623
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,335
The Library has a corpse eater

624
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,175
that can help take
him to the Underworld.

625
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,181
What's she saying?

626
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,727
What... What...
Fuck, stop signing!

627
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,686
Burn his body. - Burn his body?

628
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,178
Oh, hell no.

629
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,883
Then he'll be stuck
there for eternity,

630
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,850
turning into a ghost, or worse.

631
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,705
She says, "Better than a slave

632
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,527
"to the people who killed him.

633
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,891
"For a billion years."

634
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,761
Am I the only one
that knows that eternity

635
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,859
is a lot longer
than a billion years?

636
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,766
Lance said his mom
was a McAllistair.

637
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,503
Well, that would explain
how he got into Brakebills.

638
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,842
The McAllistairs are
on the board of trustees.

639
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,906
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

640
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,211
Lance's father held the key.

641
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,946
I mean, he knew
how powerful it was.

642
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,247
That it would reveal truth.

643
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,346
It would show things
that were hidden.

644
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,913
So, he would have kept it.

645
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,755
Except that he would
have died by now, so...

646
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,624
Wait, could you get
us into that house?

647
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,192
Maybe.

648
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,858
Irene McAllistair's been
calling me every day

649
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,798
looking for a lead on the magic.

650
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,197
Perhaps if we could
give her something

651
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,295
that she really wants...

652
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,741
Hey, have you been paying
attention to Quentin's stupid key thing?

653
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,643
Have I? Yeah, great, shut up.

654
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,305
The ghost said it has
the power to reveal things

655
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,645
that are hidden.

656
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,284
I'm a hidden thing.

657
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,878
Twist.

658
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,390
Okay, tonight it'll be
seven days since I died.

659
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,286
If I don't contact Kady today,

660
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,157
she is either gonna
burn my corpse,

661
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,287
or worse, give
it to the Library.

662
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,795
I'm not getting eaten.

663
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,900
You know, Q said Eliot
already found one of those keys.

664
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,926
Okay, simple plan.

665
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,098
We use the key to make a
Shadow Bat monster illusion

666
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,607
like that priest
did on that island.

667
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,309
We scare away the bad
men, we get to a book chute,

668
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,107
we find a door, and
we get the hell out.

669
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,306
Okay. Okay.

670
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,650
Please tell me you can see me.

671
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,125
Jesus.

672
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,354
Holy moly.

673
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,191
What have I done?

674
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,299
Eliot, what the hell
are you wearing?

675
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,531
Hi, Dad.

676
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,073
Hi, Dad.

677
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,040
This is your
father? Hi, Grandpa.

678
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,611
What is with everyone and
their daddy issues today?

679
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,123
Dressed like that,
everyone's gonna know

680
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,048
you haven't worked
a day in your life.

681
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,173
It's just an illusion.

682
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,445
I didn't think you could make

683
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,316
a sailor's uniform look gayer.

684
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,322
My God. It's just an illusion.

685
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,949
Eliot, you might be the
only person in the multiverse

686
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,220
more fucked than me.

687
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,453
You're just an illusion.

688
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,056
I wish I could help.

689
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,460
Henry. DEAN: How are you?

690
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,729
It is so good to see you!

691
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,067
I was so happy when you called.

692
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,871
Yeah. Irene, these
are my students.

693
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,468
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

694
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,706
Come on in.

695
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,487
Okay, there's some
real <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

696
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,025
kind of stuff happening here.

697
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,584
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

698
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,425
Well, the house's
enchantments run

699
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,490
on a reserve of energy that
my father built up over decades.

700
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,002
When he was a child,
there was a blackout

701
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,436
that lasted for months.

702
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,198
So he wanted to be prepared.

703
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,270
Please, come. Follow me.

704
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,309
Unfortunately, they won't last.

705
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,440
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

706
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,574
Which is why I was so
intrigued by your call, Henry.

707
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,614
Would you like a martini?

708
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,083
Martini!

709
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,590
Can I get an olive
in mine, please?

710
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,728
Thank you.

711
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,230
Thank you.

712
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,304
So, which one of
you can do magic?

713
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,573
Um...

714
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,981
Well, I, um...

715
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,977
So, before I knew
about magic, real magic,

716
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,750
I... I used to do a lot
of sleight of hand tricks.

717
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:24,091
So, it turns out that I
wasn't very good at it.

718
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:29,594
I was cheating, by
using translocation spells

719
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,136
without really knowing it.

720
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,965
I don't know why, but,
um, those tricks still work.

721
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,275
Or you have a squished
olive in your pocket.

722
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,078
Fascinating.

723
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,115
Not at all useful, but, uh...

724
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,314
I can do more.

725
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,448
Um... Do you have
a deck of cards?

726
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,655
Uh, excuse me.

727
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,327
Where's your restroom?

728
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,647
Holy shit.

729
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,659
I'm sorry, Penny.

730
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,891
It's been six and a half days.

731
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,834
Time's up.

732
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,715
Come on.

733
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,026
Come on, find it!

734
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,198
Come on!

735
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,563
Damn it.

736
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,112
Kady, wait.

737
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,548
I just need more time.

738
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,291
It's not too late.

739
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,954
Corpse eater will
be here any minute.

740
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,226
Honestly, why do you care?

741
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,998
He was my friend.

742
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,393
He wasn't one of you.

743
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,069
You're right. I
barely knew Penny.

744
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,947
I don't know where he was from,

745
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,443
I don't know about his family,

746
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,674
I don't know... I don't
know how he found magic.

747
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,617
But I know what
it's like to be trapped

748
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,351
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

749
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,126
But in the Underworld,

750
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,018
he still gets to be Penny.

751
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,790
Dammit, Alice, I'm still me.

752
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:50,325
It took everything I had

753
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,664
to try to save his life.

754
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,038
And then

755
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,805
he died anyway.

756
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,873
And then, I... And
then I was relieved.

757
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,641
To be done.

758
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,821
If Penny was here...

759
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,491
If he could tell us
what he wanted...

760
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,356
But he's not.

761
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay, look, they're
both terrible options,

762
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,657
but if I had to choose,

763
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,632
please don't send
me to the Underworld.

764
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,673
I know you don't
want the responsibility.

765
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,837
So don't take it.

766
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,736
Let me.

767
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,214
No, Kady, please.

768
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,187
Be the candle.

769
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,519
Be the candle.

770
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,085
I'll go get the corpse eater.

771
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,068
Penny...

772
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,714
That's uncomfortable to hold.

773
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,712
It makes me feel like...

774
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,991
I don't know, like
I'm not really myself.

775
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,525
Okay, then I will

776
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,896
pass on touching it.

777
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,225
Oh, uh... I checked the book.

778
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,962
So, you unlocked chapter three.

779
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:38,237
Um... And it looks
like the... The next key

780
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,242
might be in Fillory, maybe.

781
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,540
Um...

782
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,416
Dean Fogg.

783
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,712
Good morning.

784
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,253
Yeah. It is the morning.

785
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,614
Irene sent her apologies.

786
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,650
Our little show did not
convince her last night.

787
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:56,827
We're out of time.

788
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,419
As of this morning,

789
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,022
the board of directors
put Brakebills up for sale.

790
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,794
The school will be closed.

791
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,130
I'm out of a job.

792
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,094
And I'd say you're evicted,

793
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,164
but I have no idea who
actually owns this building.

794
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,606
Quentin, is this scotch or rye?

795
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,306
Rum. Excellent.

796
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,278
Well, carry on.

797
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,287
I'm going to go lie down.

798
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,117
Well, look at it this way.

799
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,792
Now we've both been
kicked out of Brakebills, so...

800
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,591
We've got that in common.

801
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,765
Holy shit.

802
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,206
Thank Christ. Eliot?

803
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,944
Hey. How did you...

804
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,309
Hey.

805
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,810
Can I please have some water?

806
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,185
Yeah, sure. Sparkling, please.

807
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,658
Gather 'round.

808
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,864
Story time with Uncle Eliot.

809
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,262
This story is called,

810
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:17,638
"Eliot did nothing wrong
but was chased by cannibals

811
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,110
"through the befucked
Neitherlands anyway."

812
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,372
Sorry, who's this?

813
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,880
Oh, right, yeah. Meet Fray.

814
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,177
Our daughter.

815
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,047
I'm sorr... Your...
Wait, your daughter?

816
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,713
Please, hold your
questions till the end.

817
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,990
So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

818
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,558
Naturally, I resolved
to use the key,

819
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,927
which, in Fillory,
created illusions

820
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,522
of a terrifying monster.

821
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,897
He made his father instead.

822
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,759
No spoilers.

823
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,170
But, yeah. What she said.

824
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,104
Turns out the key
creates illusions

825
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,368
of what you most fear.

826
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,670
Hence...

827
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,241
My dad.

828
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,510
I told my father that
the guys in the tent

829
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,709
didn't know the difference
between a tractor

830
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,944
and a backhoe.

831
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,217
So he went to set them straight.

832
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,280
You saying you...
You fed your...

833
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,115
Your dad to cannibals?

834
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,859
An illusion of him. But, yes.

835
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,027
It was very cathartic.

836
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,299
There was lots of
screaming on both sides.

837
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,627
But we snuck right past them.

838
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,264
We found a key, too. Uh...

839
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,112
We've been... We've
been calling it the truth key

840
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,111
'cause it... Well,
it reveals truths.

841
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,148
Truths. I can
handle a little truth.

842
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,116
I don't know.

843
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,656
I don't see anything.

844
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,248
Maybe it doesn't work on me.

845
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:42,993
Oh, hey, Penny.

846
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,318
Wait.
