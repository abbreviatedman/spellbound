00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,495
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:05,249
Q, I think this is it.
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,750
Jules, this is our quest.

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,878
Was there always
a keyhole right there?

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,964
The eye can never be fixed.

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,547
But you can't spy on me anymore.

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,633
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,342
to think about what you've done.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,722
Alice!

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,983
I'm sorry.
You called me too late.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,107
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He can't.

12
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,606
No, come on, Pen.
Don't, don't, come on.

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,607
- No.
- Shit.

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,577
What the fuck is happening?

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,326
We have to do something.

16
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,418
Do something!

17
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,871
Kady.

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,672
Kady, he's gone.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,836
No.

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,755
Kady. Kady, I'm right...

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,105
You need to hear me.

22
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,019
I was astral projecting.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,069
I wasn't in my body
when I died... It died.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,361
Damn it!

25
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,700
Damn it.

26
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,788
Damn it!

27
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,168
Q. Hey.

28
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,130
Hey, I... What's wrong?

29
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,757
Um... It's... It's Penny.

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,564
Oh, come on.

31
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,153
I'm sorry.
Do you ever have, like,

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,073
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't...

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,118
Um...

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,373
Why is nobody crying?

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,544
I saved all your asses
so many times.

36
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,752
Appreciate me!

37
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:29,189
Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

38
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,686
Yes?

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,358
Okay, um, yeah.

40
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,158
We're here today
to remember the life

41
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,827
of a friend and student.

42
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,490
William Penny Adi...

43
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,075
Adi, uh...

44
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,128
I don't really know how
to pronounce his last name.

45
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,456
It's Adiyodi. Idiot.

46
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,881
Penny was complicated.

47
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,426
And I think
he probably hated me.

48
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,380
But, um...

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,966
None of us really knew him.

50
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,018
Not even me.

51
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,765
That's how he wanted it.

52
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,597
So, uh...

53
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,772
All I can really say is, uh...

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,366
I am so screwed.

55
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,603
Okay, come on.

56
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,904
Damn it.

57
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,954
Yo.

58
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,994
Bodi, you down there?

59
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,245
Shep!

60
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,414
I found one of them
soft ones you like.

61
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,836
Don't burn it.

62
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,169
Oh. The vellum feels nice
on my ass.

63
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,875
No, no, no, no, no. I need that.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,336
I got a surprise for you, too.

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
Fresh meat upstairs.

66
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,755
What's it been?

67
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,841
Two weeks since
we caught the librarian?

68
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,431
Not much left but gristle.

69
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,976
You ate a librarian?

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,860
Hi, there.

71
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,730
- Eliot?
- Hello, kind strangers.

72
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,609
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

73
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,113
That's a bad move, Eliot.

74
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,866
What brought you
to the Neitherlands?

75
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,530
Family vacation.

76
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,740
No, I mean...

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,866
We got here using magic beans.

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,826
- We used a magic key.
- Right.

79
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,380
But there's no magic now,
so, um, we're stuck.

80
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,253
- Like you?
- That's right.

81
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,418
Fountains are all frozen over.

82
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,753
We haven't eaten in days.

83
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,882
Right. Um...

84
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,803
If you had an extra
sandwich or something...

85
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,600
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

86
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,849
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

87
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,475
No, no, no. No, Eliot, don't!

88
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,681
They're cannibals!

89
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,061
Oh, God.

90
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,833
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

91
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,477
No, that's... Don't eat that.

92
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,154
No, don't eat that, please.

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,778
You're eating a dude!
Mmm. It's not bad.

94
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,733
Man, seriously, fuck this place!

95
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,530
I can't believe that he's gone.

96
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,950
I mean, we were never
really that close.

97
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,955
But I don't know, I...

98
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,455
I loved him, I think.

99
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,129
It's just... How come
you never really know

100
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,677
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

101
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,430
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

102
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,598
What?

103
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,100
I loved that.

104
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,269
Were you close with your dad?

105
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,355
Oh.

106
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,152
For fuck's sake.

107
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,318
I saw him a few weeks ago.

108
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,149
It's crazy. Um...

109
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,828
The cancer that he had
was sort of

110
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,996
inherently magical,

111
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,948
so magic went away, and...

112
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,667
He's, like, in remission.

113
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,880
Sorry. I didn't mean to, uh...

114
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,668
No, it's good. It's good.

115
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,048
It's the one good thing
to come out of this.

116
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,661
I didn't know when I was
gonna see you again.

117
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,142
I had nowhere else to go.

118
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,597
After the burial, I can't be
in the same room as my mom.

119
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,435
I mean, we could use your help.

120
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,560
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back...

121
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,269
Honestly,
I don't think we should.

122
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,944
Okay, I don't really know
where to begin with that.

123
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,117
But, I mean,
for starters, I mean,

124
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,693
this is... This is our quest.

125
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,181
I sort of feel like
we were elected.

126
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,867
It's magic. Jesus, Alice, I...

127
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,370
You turn it back on,
what happens to your dad?

128
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,586
Sometimes I want magic back

129
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,334
more than anything.

130
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,666
And sometimes I just...

131
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,970
I look around and see
what a mess we made with it.

132
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,552
Right now I just wanna be 23,

133
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,391
and not know what I want,

134
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,264
and not know what I'm doing.

135
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,433
Yeah.

136
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,318
Oh, God.

137
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,736
I just remembered,
I have to tell.

138
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,407
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

139
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,698
How? Aren't they in Fillory?

140
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,285
What are you doing?

141
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,887
That was super weird.

142
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,426
Your Majesty,
if you would prefer,

143
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,013
we can put into harbor
at Broken Bay instead.

144
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,019
When did you get
this sweet boat?

145
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,603
Man.

146
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,943
I miss all the cool shit.

147
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,440
We don't have a choice.

148
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,947
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

149
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,149
the Fairy Queen will fly in

150
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,984
on the back
of some whimsical animal,

151
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,694
and she'll slit our throats,
or worse.

152
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,575
A messenger bunny, Your Majesty.

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,082
Penny's dead. Sorry.

154
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,208
Penny's dead?

155
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,336
Was he not already?

156
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,845
What?

157
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,514
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

158
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,717
Finally!

159
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,351
He was my best friend.

160
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,225
Okay, I mean, all right.

161
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,772
I guess I always thought

162
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,566
someday we were gonna bang.

163
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,771
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

164
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,317
You know, I... I thought
we'd have normal problems.

165
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,028
Like, I'd look at other girls,
and you'd get mad.

166
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,239
Or you'd tell me a story
for the third time,

167
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,324
and we'd realize we have
nothing left to say.

168
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,035
But we don't get
normal problems.

169
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,207
I know what
you're looking for. Don't.

170
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,131
This is stupid.

171
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,382
What do you think
this is gonna solve?

172
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,806
You can't hear a word I say.

173
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,065
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

174
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,268
if I can't do a damn thing
about it, so...

175
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,654
I'm gonna go.

176
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,362
Try and find some way
to fix this.

177
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,739
Goodbye, Kady.

178
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,246
Julia.

179
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,879
Help her. Now.

180
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,839
- What?
- The hell?

181
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,137
You're the only one who can.

182
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,889
What? What happened?

183
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,818
Oh, fuck.

184
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,605
- Jesus.
- Kady!

185
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,690
Kady, come on!

186
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:18,909
Um...

187
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,366
Kady...

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,906
Come on!

189
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,128
- Come on.
- Please, Kady.

190
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,748
Wake up.

191
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,584
Okay. Okay.

192
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,465
Okay, baby.

193
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,762
Okay.

194
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,597
Holy shit, that was gross.

195
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,687
What?

196
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,897
You can see me?

197
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,022
You can see me?

198
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,609
- Hey, what's your deal?
- Sorry.

199
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,907
It's just, you're talking to me,

200
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,204
and not through me,

201
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,327
and that's kind of huge, Penny.

202
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,453
How do you know my name?

203
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,079
Well, I've been watching you

204
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,207
and your friends
since you got here.

205
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,047
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

206
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,798
- Hyman?
- Mmm-hmm.

207
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,836
Did that mean something
different when you were born?

208
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,920
Wait, you haven't heard of me?

209
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,974
The Pervert Ghost of Brakebills?

210
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,969
I was a student here
in the 1920s.

211
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,429
A Traveler, like you.

212
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,642
I would practice astral
projection around the campus.

213
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,481
You know, pop into lectures,
the dormitories,

214
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,654
showers, you know how it is.

215
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,073
- Uh... No.
- And as a prank,

216
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,825
someone moved my body
while I was...

217
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,029
Being a fucking pervert.

218
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,203
And, yes, in their defense,
I was given several warnings.

219
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,159
But I never found my body.

220
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,338
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

221
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,167
It must have died
without me in it.

222
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,673
- That's a bummer.
- Well, joke's on them.

223
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,970
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

224
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,969
So it's all peeping,
all the time.

225
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,552
You know you're not
a ghost, right?

226
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,061
Wha... I'm not?

227
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,559
You were on the astral plane
when you died.

228
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,686
So was I.

229
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,358
Our minds were traveling.

230
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,982
Now they have no place
to go back to.

231
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,399
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

232
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,233
so they relive their death
over and over.

233
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,613
Are you doing that?

234
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,240
People can see ghosts.

235
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,205
Ghosts can touch things.

236
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,704
I know, 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

237
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,910
and it wasn't great.

238
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,164
We can't do that.

239
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,247
Okay, Professor, then how come

240
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,672
I can sit in a chair?

241
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,501
Why am I not
just falling forever?

242
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,051
I don't know.
I don't make the rules.

243
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,594
Your ass just knows.

244
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,889
Look, didn't you
figure all this shit out

245
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,058
100 years ago when you died?

246
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,903
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

247
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,064
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive-ish?

248
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,311
Believe me, I tried everything.

249
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,813
For years.

250
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,729
It did not end well.

251
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,133
What do you mean,
it didn't end...

252
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,819
Shh. Shut up.

253
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,150
Shut up.

254
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,903
- Hey.
- Hey.

255
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,078
How's Kady?

256
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,746
Sleeping it off
in the infirmary.

257
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,575
How did you know
to knock down her door?

258
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,582
- Just a feeling.
- Okay.

259
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,288
They're my favorite pairing.

260
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,918
The tension between them.

261
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,592
Friends for years,
but he's always loved her.

262
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,421
You're in a bit of a research
K-Hole here.

263
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,346
- Yeah.
- It's cool.

264
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,632
It just reminds me of me.

265
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,348
So, the second key...
So, the knight's daughter,

266
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,430
she found it in a sentient cave

267
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,980
that just kept
asking her riddles,

268
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,627
and wouldn't let her in until
it deemed her worthy.

269
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,983
- It was very patronizing.
- Wait.

270
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,401
Why does that sound familiar?

271
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,777
Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

272
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,154
in the first Fillory book,
<i>The World in the Walls.</i>

273
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,327
He was being chased by
a belligerent cassowary.

274
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,450
- I remember.
- Right. Um...

275
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,624
So he finds this mountain
of treasure,

276
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,076
but only takes one item.

277
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,502
A golden key.

278
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,704
To bring to his friend.

279
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,333
Right, that he met
during the war.

280
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,632
So, look, if this story is real,

281
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,630
and he actually did
give him the key,

282
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,801
then I... I...

283
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,380
Jules, I think the key
is here on Earth.

284
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,303
Seriously?

285
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,559
These two?

286
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,346
You and Kady are great.

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,897
I totally ship that.

288
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,815
Alice is okay.

289
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,567
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

290
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,485
- You know?
- I don't get that reference.

291
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,196
Oh, Josh is my idol.

292
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,567
That man is a Vagician.

293
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,701
But Quentin, I mean,

294
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:36,624
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

295
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,826
As someone born in 1902,

296
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,872
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

297
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,339
Anyway, Quentin is
the duck's nuts.

298
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,547
No, that cannot be
a real thing people said.

299
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,348
So we should send
a message to Eliot.

300
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,266
Shit. Eliot.

301
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,690
Oh, my God.

302
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,731
Cannibals! They're cannibals!

303
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,069
I told you!

304
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,776
Oh, my God.

305
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,152
They made me

306
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,742
eat a person.

307
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,527
We should make a deal with them.

308
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,702
No.

309
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,872
You can't negotiate
with cannibals.

310
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,415
You can't give them
what they want.

311
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,913
- Well, can't we?
- No!

312
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,419
You're grounded.

313
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,213
We need to find
a way out of here.

314
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,610
On the <i>Muntjac,</i>
the key created the door

315
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,091
out of nowhere
when we needed it.

316
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,214
I don't see any doors
or places a door could be.

317
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,511
Downstairs in the Library!

318
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,472
You lied about the key.

319
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,932
They lied first.

320
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,579
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

321
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,469
No, you lied to me.

322
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,105
You were never collecting taxes.

323
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,044
Uh, can we have this talk
when we're not being hunted

324
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,934
- by cannibals?
- What is the key for?

325
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,815
- Fray!
- What does it really do?

326
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,109
It doesn't fucking matter
if we can't find a door.

327
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,359
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

328
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,660
No shit!

329
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,932
I think, there are cannibals
sitting on the only entry point.

330
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,072
Wait, they're coming!

331
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,953
Run, run, run!

332
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,580
Slow down! I have wooden toes!

333
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,831
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

334
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,754
Hyman, where have you been?

335
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,155
I went with them
to solve the mystery

336
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,795
of Rupert's golden key.

337
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,338
Who cares?

338
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,178
If they find
all seven keys, Penny,

339
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,304
then...

340
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,852
Something good happens?

341
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,520
I missed a bit.

342
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,269
So the seven keys

343
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,147
from the story unlock magic?

344
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,444
Oh, that's...

345
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,022
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

346
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,027
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

347
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,162
in World War II.

348
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,532
His name was Lance Morrison.

349
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,331
And it turns out that
after the war,

350
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,455
Lance went to a magic school.

351
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,956
- Brakebills.
- Right.

352
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,211
So if there are any records
from the late 1940s,

353
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,458
maybe that can help us
find the key.

354
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,044
My assistant's file cabinet,
bottom drawer.

355
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,379
Thank you.

356
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,391
- Pardon the interruption.
- Can I help you?

357
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,094
Wait a minute. I know that guy.

358
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,395
I certainly hope you can.

359
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,017
I'm here on behalf of The Order.

360
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,060
At the Library formerly
headquartered in the Neitherlands?

361
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,479
We need to talk about Penny.

362
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,617
Sorry to be blunt,

363
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,786
but did Penny die
a traumatic death?

364
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,955
Dean Fogg said
you were the one to ask.

365
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,247
Yes, it was traumatic.

366
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,290
That explains it.

367
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,341
Penny signed a contract
with The Order,

368
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,418
guaranteeing his services
in this life

369
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,094
and, well, beyond.

370
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,256
Curiously, his soul never
reported for service

371
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,386
to our Underworld branch.

372
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,476
Then where is he?

373
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,972
I'm right here.

374
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,766
Likely in the process
of becoming a vengeful spirit.

375
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,065
Best to nip that in the bud
before his time is up.

376
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,231
What do you mean?

377
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,462
The soul is tethered to the body

378
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,977
for seven days after death.

379
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,277
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

380
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,698
and send him on his way.

381
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,777
- How?
- Eat him, naturally.

382
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,863
Sweetheart,
I'm not gonna eat him.

383
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,198
I'm a pescatarian.

384
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,144
The Order has retained
the services of a corpse eater

385
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,534
for situations such as this.

386
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,211
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no one is eating my body, okay?

387
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,578
I'm not fucking done
with it yet.

388
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,168
Kind of a ticking clock on this.

389
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,296
If the tether goes
before Penny's soul passes on,

390
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,547
he's right fucked.

391
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,216
The corpse eater
needs a tick to prepare.

392
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,802
She'll be here tomorrow
at sundown.

393
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,137
Oh, and you're welcome.

394
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,530
The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

395
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,282
But Penny still has his tether.

396
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,742
I'm not a ghost!

397
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,444
If he's a ghost,
shouldn't he be,

398
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,947
I don't... I don't know,
haunting us?

399
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,727
What if something else happened?

400
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,913
Yes, something else did happen!

401
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,746
It can take decades for
a spirit to become malevolent.

402
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,498
Corpse eaters
are a rare creature.

403
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,584
If the Librarians
actually have one,

404
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,886
not just some sicko
who wants a free meal,

405
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,925
you should use it.

406
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,470
But what if there's a way
to fix him?

407
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,722
To bring him back?

408
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,474
Without magic?

409
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,271
Julia has magic.

410
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,850
Okay, not much, but I...

411
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,229
It's just, I... I...
I can't wrap my head around

412
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,487
sending him to work for the
Library for a billion years.

413
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,530
I don't trust them.

414
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,486
There you go. Come on, Kady.

415
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,162
The Underworld's not so bad.

416
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,574
Quentin says
there's a bowling alley.

417
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,793
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

418
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,120
Damn it, Alice.

419
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,830
I thought we were bros.

420
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,962
Ah. Let go, let go, let go!

421
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,759
My God!

422
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,878
I was only trying to follow
the story.

423
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,636
No, what Julia does
in the bath is not story!

424
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,560
It is revealing of character.

425
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,018
Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

426
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,849
Okay?

427
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,560
Now, I don't give a shit
if it didn't end well

428
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,941
for you in the past.
You are going to help me.

429
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,775
Or I will cock block you
for the rest of time.

430
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,863
Okay.

431
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,001
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

432
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,921
I spent months
trying to push things.

433
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,380
I never got anywhere.

434
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,675
Until I tried being the thing.

435
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,591
Uh...

436
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,678
Okay, focus on a penny.

437
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,602
Get it? 'Cause of your name?
You get it.

438
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,597
Now, you're not gonna try
to move the penny.

439
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,308
You're gonna try to be it.

440
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,191
So pour yourself into its shape.

441
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,111
Inhabit it
with your whole being.

442
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,733
Hmm?

443
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,110
Go ahead.

444
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,827
- Be the penny.
- Okay.

445
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,616
I got this.

446
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,539
Be the penny.

447
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,705
<i>Just be the goddamn penny!</i>

448
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,795
Penny, just be it!

449
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,246
What does that even mean?

450
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,501
You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

451
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,069
Maybe we should have started
with a nickel.

452
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,085
- Wha...
- Huh? Be the nickel!

453
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,341
Maybe you shouldn't say
the same dumb shit

454
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,842
over and over!

455
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,595
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you're a dullard!

456
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,639
A real dunce, I say!

457
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,312
You are worth less than a penny,

458
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,889
and a penny is worthless!

459
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,195
Um...

460
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,982
This is weird.

461
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,314
You are the penny.

462
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,238
What do I do now? I can't move.

463
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,194
Well, how could you?
You don't have any feet.

464
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,953
What are you...
What are you doing?

465
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,243
It sounds like you're pooping.

466
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,628
Holy zerts! You did it!

467
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,380
Oh.

468
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,044
I still have the taste
of pennies in my mouth.

469
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,923
Wait, why... Why don't I...

470
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,268
Why don't I just project
myself into my own body?

471
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,595
I know how to be that.

472
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,270
The only reason
you're still alive

473
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,895
is because you were astral
projecting when you died.

474
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,359
So if you go back
into your corpse,

475
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,812
you'll just be dead.

476
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,073
I need something bigger.

477
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,484
I need something that can talk.

478
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,445
Yeah, hey, be careful.

479
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,374
Controlling things with brains
is much harder.

480
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,372
Be the bunny.

481
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,916
Be the bunny.

482
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,623
- Be the bunny.
- It won't work.

483
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,257
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

484
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,806
with a few days' time
out on Eliot's party boat?

485
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,851
Your Majesty, upon our return
to Whitespire,

486
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:39,432
might I suggest a hot bath
to relax yourself?

487
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:44,145
I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

488
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,989
I keep waiting for Eliot
to come back.

489
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,941
But maybe he never will.

490
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,203
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

491
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,907
For all I know, he's dead.

492
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,002
And him and Penny are blowing
each other in Heaven.

493
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,415
Now, when I get back...

494
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,169
I'm gonna fix this.

495
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,344
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

496
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,302
Tick, you're gonna go to that
fairy-repelling hallway

497
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,183
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

498
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,981
You're gonna put it
in the Fairy Queen's bath

499
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,560
and when that knocks her
on her ass,

500
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,355
I'm gonna cut out her heart
and eat it

501
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,658
in front of every goddamn
fairy asshole in the kingdom.

502
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,950
Damn. Girl, you get shit done.

503
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,009
And I thought Hyman was a perv.

504
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,386
Be the Margolem.

505
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,481
Be the Margolem.

506
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,524
Uh, um... Um, announcement.

507
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,697
You guys remember the Margolem?

508
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,900
Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

509
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,902
Since Margo's been gone,
I've been storing it.

510
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,532
You know, for safekeeping?

511
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,535
- Ew.
- That's problematic.

512
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,911
It's not like that.

513
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,789
I just dress her up
and pretend she respects me.

514
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,247
Anyways, she's been out of commission
since magic died,

515
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,923
only...

516
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,717
She woke up.

517
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,553
Fuck.

518
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,151
I told you it wouldn't end well.

519
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,698
You know, I wish
you weren't dead

520
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,624
so I could kill you.

521
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,418
<i>So, this Margolem must've had</i>

522
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,247
some residual magic left in her.

523
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,299
Or the living clay she was made of
was a magical creature?

524
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,238
Uh, anyway, while we
have you here,

525
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,549
we found Lance Morrison's
Brakebill records.

526
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,723
Um... It says that he was only
a student for a semester.

527
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,138
But it also says
in this file that he left

528
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,435
because of a "code seven."

529
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,887
Student suicide.

530
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,809
Or he magically exploded.

531
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,061
I don't know why they use
the same damn code for both.

532
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,315
Okay, either way,
he died on campus.

533
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,237
So the key might still
be here, right?

534
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,843
But it says he was living
in the West Dorm,

535
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,147
and there is
no such thing, so...

536
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,282
That's because it's buried.

537
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,361
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

538
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,491
In the late 1940s,

539
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,039
there was a haunting
in the West Dorm.

540
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,957
At the time,
it was considered bad form

541
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,751
to have a ghost on campus.

542
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,338
Unlike today, where we put it
in the goddamn brochure.

543
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,383
"That ghost" is gonna kill them.

544
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,047
To death, Penny.

545
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,129
So, the Dean buried
the whole dorm.

546
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,009
Magically protected
the entrances

547
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,410
so that students
couldn't find it.

548
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,643
But magic is gone.
So we can walk right in.

549
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,813
Right?

550
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,014
What are you gonna do?

551
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,188
Nothing.

552
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,187
It's not my problem.

553
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,690
- They're your friends.
- Who I can't help in any way.

554
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,362
You go figure some shit out.

555
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,569
I'm not going down there.

556
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,401
What are you scared of?

557
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,576
You're dead already.

558
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,121
You're so dumb, Penny.

559
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,621
Ghosts can hurt
whatever it is we are.

560
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,576
That one in the West dorm?

561
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,957
Terrorized me for a week.

562
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,380
Wait a minute.

563
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,673
If they can hurt us, then...
Then they can see us.

564
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,736
Hey. Q.

565
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:08,835
All right.

566
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,917
Um... Excuse me.

567
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,547
Lance Morrison?

568
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:20,847
Who are you?

569
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,422
Did my father send you?

570
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,599
You can tell him I am not
coming home for winter.

571
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,017
Hey, ghost boy.

572
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,682
We need to talk.

573
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:35,102
You need to tell them that
Penny is in the room with them.

574
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,902
What are you talking about?

575
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,942
No, I am not a bitch!

576
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,052
- Well, we don't think that.
- Right, no, of course.

577
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,989
Do you know anything
about a golden key

578
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,117
that maybe your friend
Rupert Chatwin gave you?

579
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,577
Rupert?

580
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,962
This place is quite something.

581
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,960
Nothing compared
to where you've been.

582
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,834
He's in a ghost loop.

583
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,030
He's not even listening to us.

584
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,545
I brought you something.

585
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,052
From Fillory. Here.

586
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,557
Take it.

587
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,226
It won't hurt.

588
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,350
It just reveals the honest
truth of things.

589
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,681
Shows them as they truly are.

590
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,152
I see.

591
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,495
Damn it, Hyman.

592
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,293
This isn't terrifying.
It's just two dudes kissing.

593
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,291
You homophobic pussy.

594
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,212
Lance Morrison.

595
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,918
You've been speaking out of turn

596
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,628
about your mother's family.

597
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,347
You have sullied
the McAllistair name.

598
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,890
All I did was tell the truth.

599
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,261
Truth can bury us.

600
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,354
It's the key.

601
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,056
It's ruined everything.

602
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,390
Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt
this little father-son moment,

603
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,982
but could someone please
just say the words,

604
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,439
"Penny is in the room"?

605
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,070
- Say it isn't true.
- Okay.

606
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,702
You can't control yourself.

607
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,497
Don't blame the key
for your perversion.

608
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,958
Whoa, dude!

609
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,414
Whoa!

610
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,137
The key's in the dad's pocket.

611
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,010
I think he just...

612
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,471
Oh, shit.

613
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,774
I tried being nice.

614
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,572
You will say my name.

615
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,741
You say my name, you ghost dick!

616
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,193
What is your name?

617
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,195
That's not a name!

618
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,702
No, it isn't!

619
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,907
Uh, Q?

620
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,910
I think we might have
broken this ride.

621
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,211
No!

622
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,266
The Library has a corpse eater

623
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,093
that can help take him
to the Underworld.

624
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,106
What's she saying?

625
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,669
What... What...
Fuck, stop signing!

626
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,605
- Burn his body.
- Burn his body?

627
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,106
Oh, hell no.

628
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,812
Then he'll be stuck there
for eternity,

629
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,778
turning into a ghost, or worse.

630
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,569
She says, "Better than a slave"

631
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,449
"to the people who killed him."

632
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,822
"For a billion years."

633
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,703
Am I the only one that
knows that eternity

634
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,784
is a lot longer
than a billion years?

635
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,706
Lance said his mom
was a McAllistair.

636
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,416
Well, that would explain
how he got into Brakebills.

637
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,752
The McAllistairs are
on the board of trustees.

638
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,839
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

639
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,139
Lance's father held the key.

640
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,887
I mean, he knew
how powerful it was.

641
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,184
That it would reveal truth.

642
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,262
It would show things
that were hidden.

643
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,847
So, he would have kept it.

644
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,683
Except that he would have
died by now, so...

645
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,564
Wait, could you get us
into that house?

646
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,103
Maybe.

647
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,780
Irene McAllistair's been
calling me every day

648
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,740
looking for a lead on the magic.

649
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,111
Perhaps if we could
give her something

650
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,241
that she really wants...

651
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,659
Hey, have you been paying attention
to Quentin's stupid key thing?

652
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,585
- Have I?
- Yeah, great, shut up.

653
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,247
The ghost said it has
the power to reveal things

654
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,582
that are hidden.

655
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,217
I'm a hidden thing.

656
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,794
Twist.

657
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,301
Okay, tonight it'll be
seven days since I died.

658
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,219
If I don't contact Kady today,

659
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,096
she is either gonna
burn my corpse,

660
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,223
or worse,
give it to the Library.

661
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,724
I'm not getting eaten.

662
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,808
You know, Q said Eliot already
found one of those keys.

663
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,851
Okay, simple plan.

664
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,029
We use the key to make
a Shadow Bat monster illusion

665
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,526
like that priest did
on that island.

666
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,238
We scare away the bad men,
we get to a book chute,

667
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,034
we find a door,
and we get the hell out.

668
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,237
- Okay.
- Okay.

669
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,581
Please tell me you can see me.

670
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,050
Jesus.

671
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,296
Holy moly.

672
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,136
What have I done?

673
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,215
Eliot, what the hell
are you wearing?

674
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,471
Hi, Dad.

675
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,013
Hi, Dad.

676
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,973
- This is your father?
- Hi, Grandpa.

677
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,519
What is with everyone
and their daddy issues today?

678
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,048
Dressed like that,
everyone's gonna know

679
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,984
you haven't worked
a day in your life.

680
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,110
It's just an illusion.

681
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,361
I didn't think you could make

682
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,239
a sailor's uniform look gayer.

683
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,240
- My God.
- It's just an illusion.

684
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,868
Eliot, you might be the only
person in the multiverse

685
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,165
more fucked than me.

686
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,367
You're just an illusion.

687
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,001
I wish I could help.

688
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,382
- Henry.
- How are you?

689
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,673
It is so good to see you!

690
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,009
I was so happy when you called.

691
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,807
Yeah. Irene,
these are my students.

692
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,385
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

693
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,640
Come on in.

694
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,401
Okay, there's some real
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

695
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,948
kind of stuff happening here.

696
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,526
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

697
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,361
Well, the house's
enchantments run

698
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:22,415
on a reserve of energy that my
father built up over decades.

699
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,909
When he was a child,
there was a blackout

700
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,369
that lasted for months.

701
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,128
So he wanted to be prepared.

702
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,206
Please, come. Follow me.

703
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,251
Unfortunately, they won't last.

704
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,379
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

705
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,508
Which is why I was so
intrigued by your call, Henry.

706
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,560
Would you like a martini?

707
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,017
Martini!

708
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,527
Can I get an olive
in mine, please?

709
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,653
Thank you.

710
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,160
Thank you.

711
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,250
So, which one of you
can do magic?

712
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,498
Um...

713
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,917
Well, I, um...

714
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,919
So, before I knew about magic,
real magic,

715
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,675
I... I used to do a lot
of sleight of hand tricks.

716
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:24,011
So, it turns out that
I wasn't very good at it.

717
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:29,516
I was cheating,
by using translocation spells

718
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,066
without really knowing it.

719
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:36,899
I don't know why, but, um,
those tricks still work.

720
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,196
Or you have a squished olive
in your pocket.

721
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,995
Fascinating.

722
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,042
Not at all useful, but, uh...

723
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,245
I can do more.

724
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,375
Um... Do you have
a deck of cards?

725
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,586
Uh, excuse me.

726
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,258
Where's your restroom?

727
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,569
Holy shit.

728
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,584
I'm sorry, Penny.

729
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,832
It's been six and a half days.

730
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,756
Time's up.

731
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,649
Come on.

732
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,942
Come on, find it!

733
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,116
Come on!

734
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,500
Damn it.

735
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,045
Kady, wait.

736
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,464
I just need more time.

737
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,218
It's not too late.

738
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,884
Corpse eater will be
here any minute.

739
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,145
Honestly, why do you care?

740
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,934
He was my friend.

741
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,316
He wasn't one of you.

742
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,982
You're right.
I barely knew Penny.

743
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,884
I don't know where he was from,

744
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,365
I don't know about his family,

745
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,616
I don't know... I don't know
how he found magic.

746
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,539
But I know what it's like
to be trapped

747
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,286
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

748
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,047
But in the Underworld,

749
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,962
he still gets to be Penny.

750
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,715
Dammit, Alice, I'm still me.

751
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:50,262
It took everything I had

752
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,592
to try to save his life.

753
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,979
And then

754
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,725
he died anyway.

755
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,812
And then, I...
And then I was relieved.

756
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,571
To be done.

757
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,743
If Penny was here...

758
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,411
If he could tell us
what he wanted...

759
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,289
But he's not.

760
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,982
Okay, look, they're both
terrible options,

761
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,588
but if I had to choose,

762
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,548
please don't send me
to the Underworld.

763
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,595
I know you don't want
the responsibility.

764
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,765
So don't take it.

765
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,682
Let me.

766
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,143
No, Kady, please.

767
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,109
Be the candle.

768
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,450
Be the candle.

769
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,027
I'll go get the corpse eater.

770
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,996
Penny...

771
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,639
That's uncomfortable to hold.

772
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,636
It makes me feel like...

773
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,936
I don't know,
like I'm not really myself.

774
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,439
Okay, then I will

775
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,821
pass on touching it.

776
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,150
Oh, uh... I checked the book.

777
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,910
So, you unlocked chapter three.

778
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:38,162
Um... And it looks like the...
The next key

779
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,159
might be in Fillory, maybe.

780
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,460
Um...

781
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,339
Dean Fogg.

782
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,632
Good morning.

783
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,176
Yeah. It is the morning.

784
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,547
Irene sent her apologies.

785
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,595
Our little show did not
convince her last night.

786
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,768
We're out of time.

787
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,344
As of this morning,

788
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,976
the board of directors
put Brakebills up for sale.

789
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,727
The school will be closed.

790
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,058
I'm out of a job.

791
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,021
And I'd say you're evicted,

792
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:10,106
but I have no idea who
actually owns this building.

793
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,528
Quentin, is this scotch or rye?

794
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,239
- Rum.
- Excellent.

795
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,208
Well, carry on.

796
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,210
I'm going to go lie down.

797
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,042
Well, look at it this way.

798
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,717
Now we've both been kicked
out of Brakebills, so...

799
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,509
We've got that in common.

800
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,687
Holy shit.

801
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,147
- Thank Christ.
- Eliot?

802
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,863
- Hey.
- How did you...

803
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,231
Hey.

804
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,741
Can I please have some water?

805
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,114
- Yeah, sure.
- Sparkling, please.

806
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,578
Gather 'round.

807
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,794
Story time with Uncle Eliot.

808
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,218
This story is called,

809
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,548
"Eliot did nothing wrong
but was chased by cannibals"

810
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,055
"through the befucked
Neitherlands anyway."

811
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,305
Sorry, who's this?

812
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,809
Oh, right, yeah. Meet Fray.

813
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,105
Our daughter.

814
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,978
I'm sorr... Your...
Wait, your daughter?

815
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,651
Please, hold your questions
till the end.

816
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,903
So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

817
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,488
Naturally, I resolved
to use the key,

818
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,865
which, in Fillory,
created illusions

819
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,447
of a terrifying monster.

820
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,827
He made his father instead.

821
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,703
No spoilers.

822
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,078
But, yeah. What she said.

823
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,037
Turns out the key
creates illusions

824
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,293
of what you most fear.

825
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:51,590
Hence...

826
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,170
My dad.

827
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,424
I told my father that
the guys in the tent

828
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,631
didn't know the difference
between a tractor

829
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,886
and a backhoe.

830
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,139
So he went to set them straight.

831
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,222
You saying you...
You fed your...

832
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,057
Your dad to cannibals?

833
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,776
An illusion of him. But, yes.

834
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,940
It was very cathartic.

835
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,236
There was lots of screaming
on both sides.

836
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,568
But we snuck right past them.

837
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,200
We found a key, too. Uh...

838
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,041
We've been... We've been
calling it the truth key

839
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,036
'cause it...
Well, it reveals truths.

840
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,087
- Truths.
- I can handle a little truth.

841
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,053
I don't know.

842
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,596
I don't see anything.

843
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,173
Maybe it doesn't work on me.

844
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,934
Oh, hey, Penny.

845
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,263
Wait.
