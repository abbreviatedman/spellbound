The Tale of the Seven Keys.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,784
Jules, this is our quest.

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,880
Was there always
a keyhole right there?

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,984
The eye can never be fixed.

6
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,549
But you can't spy
on me anymore.

7
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,651
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

8
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,356
to think about
what you've done.

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,727
Alice!

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.
You called me loo late.

11
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,132
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He can't.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,636
No, come on, Pen.
Don't, don't, come on.

13
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,644
(SUBS) No.
Shit.

14
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,585
What the fuck is happening?

15
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,344
We have to do something.

16
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,415
Do something!

17
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:47,885
Kady.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,688
Kady, he's gone.

19
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,851
KADY; No.

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,766
Kady. Kady, I'm right...

21
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,110
You need to hear me.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,045
I was astral projecting.

23
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,082
I wasn't in my body
when I died... It died.

24
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,375
Damn it!

25
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,715

JULIA: Q. Hey.

29
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,127
Hey, I... What's wrong?

30
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,764
Um... It's... It's Penny.

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,586
oh, come on.

33
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,149
I'm sorry.
Do you ever have, like,

34
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,091
an inappropriate emotional
response that you just can't...

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
Um...

36
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,404
Why is nobody crying?

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,577
I saved all your asses
so many times.

38
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,778
Appreciate me!

39
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:29,185
Well, I suppose someone
should say some words.

40
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,689
Yes?

41
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,361
QUENTIN: Okay, um, yeah.

42
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,165
We're here today
to remember the life

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,833
of a friend and student.

44
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,505
William Penny Adi...

45
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,103
Adi, uh...

46
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,142
I don't really know how
to pronounce his last name.

47
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,481
It's Adiyodi. Idiot.

48
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,884
QUENTIN:
Penny was complicated.

49
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,446
And I think
he probably hated me.

50
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,388
But, um...

51
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,988
None of us really knew him.

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,029
Not even me.

53
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,790
That's how he wanted it.

54
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,630
So, uh...

55
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,805
All I can really say is, uh...

56
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,382
I am so screwed.

No, no, no, no, no.
I need that.

I got a surprise
for you, too.

Fresh meat upstairs.

70
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,771

we caught the librarian?

You ate a librarian?

Hi, there.

75
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,753
Eliot?
Hello, kind strangers.

76
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,625
We were hoping to warm
ourselves by your fire.

77
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,130
That's a bad move, Eliot.

78
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,893
What brought you
to the Neitherlands?

79
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,567

No, I mean...

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,900
We got here
using magic beans.

82
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,837
We used a magic key.
ELIOT: Right.

83
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,399
But there's no magic now,
so, um, we're stuck.

84
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,272

That's right.

No, Eliot, don't!

no, no, nu, no, no, no.</i>

96
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,165
No, don't eat that, please.

Mmm. It's not bad.

Man, seriously,
fuck this place!

99
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,533
I can't believe
that he's gone.

100
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,968
I mean, we were never
really that close.

101
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,981
But I don't know, I...

102
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,477
I loved him, I think.

103
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,154
It's just... How come
you never really know

104
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,691
how much you care about
somebody until they're gone?

105
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,464
I remember he used to let me
ride around on his shoulders.

106
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,626
What?

107
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,134
I loved that.

108
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,295
Were you close
with your dad?

109
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,363
Oh.

110
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,169
For fuck's sake.

111
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,343
QUENTIN: I saw him
a few weeks ago.

112
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,174
It's crazy. Um...

113
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,850
The cancer that he had
was sort of

114
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,015
inherently magical,

115
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,985
so magic went away, and...

116
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,686
He's, like, in remission.

117
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,894
Sorry. l didn’t mean to, uh...

118
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,693
No, it's good. It's good.

119
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,063
It's the one good thing
to come out of this.

120
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,596
L didn’t know when I was
gonna see you again.

121
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,172
I had nowhere else to go.

122
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,604
After the burial, I can't be
in the same room as my mom.

123
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,435
I mean,
we could use your help.

124
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,573
Finding these keys,
bringing magic back...

125
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,274
Honestly,
I don't think we should.

126
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,943
Okay, I don’t really know
where to begin with that.

127
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,113
But, I mean,
for starters, I mean,

128
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,713
this is... This is our quest.

129
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,122
I sort of feel like
we were elected.

130
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,887
It's magic. Jesus, Alice, I...

131
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,395
You turn it back on,
what happens to your dad?

132
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,600
(EXHALES)
Sometimes I want magic back

133
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,362
more than anything.

134
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,700
And sometimes I just...

135
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,970
I look around and see
what a mess we made with it.

136
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,577
Right now
I just wanna be 23,

137
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,413
and not know what I want,

138
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,277
and not know what I'm doing.

139
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,441
Yeah.

140
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,314
Oh, God.

141
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,758
I just remembered,
I have to tell

142
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,421
Eliot and Margo about Penny.

143
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,723
How? Aren't they in Fillory?

144
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,594
(MOUTHING)

145
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,298
What are you doing?

146
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,914
That was super weird.

148
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,015
we can put into harbor
at Broken Bay instead.

149
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,026
When did you get
this sweet boat?

150
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,629
Man.

151

152
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,466
MARGO: We don't have a choice.

153
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,961
If we sail anywhere
other than Whitespire,

154
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,163
the Fairy Queen will fly in

155
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,000
on the back
of some whimsical animal,

156
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,699
and she'll slit our throats,
or worse.

157
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,603
A messenger bunny,
Your Majesty.

158
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,116
Penny's dead. Sorry.

159
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,219
Penny's dead?

160
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,346
Was he not already?

161
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,852
What?

162
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,519
I can't believe it.
PENNY: Thank you.

163
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,728
Finally!

164
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,365
He was my best friend.

165
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,228
Okay, I mean, all right.

166
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,803
I guess I always thought

167
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,566
someday we were gonna bang.

168
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,805
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Me, too, girl. Me, too.

169
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,339
You know, I... I thought
we'd have normal problems.

170
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,043
Like, I'd look at other girls,
and you'd get mad.

171
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,244
Or your! tell me a story
for the third time,

172
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,343
and we'd realize we have
nothing left to say.

173
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,050
But we don't get
normal problems.

174
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,221
I know what
you're looking for. Don't.

175
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,157
This is stupid.

176
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,392
What do you think
this is gonna solve?

177
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,836
You can't hear a word I say.

178
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,073
There is no point in me staying
here and watching you suffer

179
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,273
if I can't do a damn thing
about it, so...

180
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,684
I'm gonna go.

181
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,381
Try and find some way
to fix this.

182
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,759
Goodbye, Kady.

183
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,262
Julia.
(GASPS)

184
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,898
Help her. Now.

185
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,869
What'?
The hell?

186
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,136
You're the only one who can.

187
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,915
What? What happened?

188
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,714
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

189
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,821
Oh, fuck.

190
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
Jesus.
Kady!

191
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,727
Kady, come on!

192
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,918
Um...

193
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,457
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

194
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,391
Kady...

195
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,928
Come on!

196
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,137
Come on.
Please, Kady.

197
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,775
Wake up.
(GASPS)

198
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,609
Okay. Okay.

199
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,476
Okay, baby.

200
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,777
<i>0K3'! -</i>

201
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,612
Holy shit,
that was gross.

202
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,679
What?

203
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,921
You can see me?

204
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,025
You can see me?

205
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,635
Hey, what's your deal?
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.

206
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,941
It's just,
you're talking to me,

207
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,203
and not through me,

208
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,335
and that's
kind of huge, Penny.

209
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,468
How do you know my name?

210
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,105
Well, I've been watching you

211
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,207
and your friends
since you got here.

212
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,049
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

213
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,820
Hyman?
Mmm-hmm.

214
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,849
Did that mean something
different when you were born?

215
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,957
Wait, you haven't
heard of me?

216
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,994
The Pervert Ghost
of Brakebills?

217
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,997
L was a student here
in the 1920s.

218
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,466
A Traveler, like you.

219
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,666
I would practice astral
projection around the campus.

220
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,506
You know, pop into lectures,
the dormitories,

221
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,673
showers, you know how it is.

222
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,075
Uh... No.
And as a prank,

223
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,840
someone moved my body
while I was...

224
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,042
Being a fucking pervert.

225
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,214
And, yes, in their defense,
I was given several warnings.

226
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,187
But I never found my body.

227
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:56,352
You can't cast a locator spell
without actual fingers, so...

228
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,192
It must have died
without me in it.

229
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,698
That's a bummer.
Well, Jake's on them.

230
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,994
'Cause now I'm a ghost.

231
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,003
So it's all peeping,
all the time.

232
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,563
You know you're not
a ghost, right?

233
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,068
Wha... I'm not?

234
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,574
You were on the astral plane
when you died.

235
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,701
So was I.

236
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,371
Our minds were traveling.

237
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,007
Now they have no place
to go back to.

238
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,414
Look, ghosts have some
unresolved shit in this world,

239
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,249
so they relive their death
over and over.

240
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,618
Are you doing that?

241
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,257
People can see ghosts.

242
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,224
Ghosts can touch things.

243
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,729
I know' 'cause I've been
touched by a ghost, Hyman,

244
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,923
and it wasn't great.

245
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,192
We can't do that

246
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,257
Okay, Professor,
then how come

247
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,700
I can sit in a chair?

248
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,534
Why am I not
just falling forever?

249
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,073
I don't know.
I don't make the rules.

250
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,608
Your ass just knows.

251
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,904
Look, didn't you
figure all this shit out

252
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,071
100 years ago when you died?

253
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,910
I mean, haven't you
communicated with anyone?

254
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,077
I mean, tried to get a message
out that you're alive-ish?

255
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,314
Believe me,
I tried everything.

256
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,817
For years.

257
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,751
It did not end well.
(DOOR OPENS)

258
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,083
What do you mean,
it didn't end...

259
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,822
Shh. Shut up.

260
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,157
Shut up.

261
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,921
JULIA: Hey.
Hey.

262
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,092
How's Kady?

263
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,760
Sleeping it off
in the infirmary.

264
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,603
How did you know
to knock down her door?

265
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,607
Just a feeling.
Okay.

266
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,302
They're my
favorite pairing.

267
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,935
The tension between them.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,606
Friends for years,
but he's always loved her.

269
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,446
You're in a bit of a research
K-Hole here.

270
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,349
Yeah.
It's cool.

271
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,652
It just reminds me of me.

272
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,355
QUENTIN: So, the second key...
So, the Knight's daughter,

273
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,448
she found it
in a sentient cave

274
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,994
that just kept
asking her riddles,

275
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,585
and wouldn't let her in until
it deemed her worthy.

276
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,994
It was very patronizing.
Wait.

277
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,429
Why does that sound familiar?

278
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,799
Because Rupert Chatwin
found the same cave

279
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,168
in the first Fillory book,
The World in the Walls.

280
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,332
He was being chased by
a belligerent cassowary.

281
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,467
I remember.
Right. Um...

282
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,638
So he finds this mountain
of treasure,

283
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,113
but only takes one item.

284
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,513
A golden key.

285
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,708
To bring to his friend.

286
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,342
Right, that he met
during the war.

287
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,648
So, look,
if this story is real,

288
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,656
and he actually did
give him the key,

289
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:06,816
then I... l...

290
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,382
Jules, I think the key
is here on Earth.

291
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,817
(CHUCKLES)

292
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,328
Seriously?

293
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,555
These two?

294
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,360
You and Kady are great.

295
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,902
I totally ship that.

296
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,832
Alice is okay.

297
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,563
She's a bit of a Mrs. Grundy.

298
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,505
You know? I don't
get that reference.

299
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,210
Oh, Josh is my idol.

300
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,572
That man is a Vagician.

301
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,706
But Quentin, I mean,

302
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,651
the outsider let into the inner
sanctum of secret knowledge.

303
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,851
As someone born in 1902,

304
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,888
I find a heterosexual white
male hero very relatable.

305
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:48,365
Anyway, Quentin is
the duck's nuts.

306
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,561
No, that cannot be
a real thing people said.

307
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,364
So we should send
a message to Eliot.

308
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,269
Shit. Eliot.

309
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,703
Oh, my God.

310
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,373
(PANTING)

311
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,746
Cannibals!
They're cannibals!

312
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,075
I told you!

313
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,784
Oh, my God.

314
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,183
They made me

315
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,749
eat a person.

316
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,546
We should make
a deal with them.

317
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,717
No.

318
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,886
You can't negotiate
with cannibals.

319
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,428
You can't give them
what they want.

320
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,929
Well, can't we?
No!

321
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,428
You're grounded.

322
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,227
We need to find
a way out of here.

323
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,565
On the Muntjac, the
key created the door

324
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,105
out of nowhere
when we needed it.

325
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,231
L don’t see any doors
or places a door could be.

326
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,536
Downstairs in the Library!

327
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,469
You lied about the key.

328
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:35,940
They lied first.

329
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,537
I couldn't risk them
taking the key from us.

330
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,480
No, you lied to me.

331
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,116
You were never
collecting taxes.

332
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,978
Uh, can we have this talk
when we're not being hunted

333
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,953
by cannibals?
What is the key for?

334
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,820
Fray!
What does it really do?

335
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,120
It doesn't fucking matter
if we can't find a door.

336
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,396
Wait, there are doors all over
the downstairs of the Library.

337
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,659
No shit!

338
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,665
I think, there are cannibals
sitting on the only entry point.

339
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,094
Wait, they're coming!

340
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,966
Run, run, run!

341
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,602
Slow down!
I have wooden toes!

342
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,834
Go,go,go,go,go,go.

343
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,773
Hyman, where have you been?

344
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,110
I went with them
to solve the mystery

345
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,808
of Rupert's golden key.

346
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,349
Who cares?

347
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,181
If they find
all seven keys, Penny,

348
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,311
then...

349
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,852
Something good happens?

350
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,517
I missed a bit.

351
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,650
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

352
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,285
So the seven keys

353
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,161
from the story unlock magic?

354
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,460
Oh, that's...

355
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,025
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

356
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,038
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

357
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,163
in World War ll.

358
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,537
His name was Lance Morrison.

359
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,339
And it turns out that
after the war,

360
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,472
Lance went to a magic school.

361
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,982
Brakebills.
JULIA: Right.

362
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,212
So if there are any records
from the late 1940s,

363
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,486
maybe that can help us
find the key.

364
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,047
My assistant's file cabinet,
bottom drawer.

365
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,386
Thank you.

366
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,388
Pardon the interruption.
Can I help you?

367
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,124
Wait a minute.
I know that guy.

368
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,394
I certainly hope you can.

369
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,025
I'm here on behalf
of The Order.

370
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,071
At the Library formerly
headquartered in the Neitherlands?

371
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,507
We need to talk about Penny.

372
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,642
Sorry to be blunt,

373
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,808
but did Penny die
a traumatic death?

374
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,987
Dean Fogg said
you were the one to ask.

375
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,250
Yes, it was traumatic.

376
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,318
That explains it.

377
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,354
Penny signed a contract
with The Order,

378
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,420
guaranteeing his services
in this life

379
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,090
and, well, beyond.

380
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,259
Curiously, his soul never
reported for service

381
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,393
to our Underworld branch.

382
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,494
Then where is he?

383
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,006
I'm right here.

384
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,772
Likely in the process
of becoming a vengeful spirit.

385
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,069
Best to nip that in the bud
before his time is up.

386
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,237
What do you mean?

387
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,370
The soul is tethered
to the body

388
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,005
for seven days after death.

389
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,278
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

390
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,717
and send him on his way.

391
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,780
How?
Eat him, naturally.

392
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,891
(CHUCKLES) Sweetheart,
I'm not gonna eat him.

393
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,223
I'm a pescatarian.

394
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,092
The Order has retained
the services of a corpse eater

395
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,562
for situations such as this.

396
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no one
is eating my body, okay?

397
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,563
I’m not fucking done
with it yet.

398
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,194
Kind of a ticking clock
on this.

399
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,296
If the tether goes
before Penny's soul passes on,

400
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,566
he's right fucked.

401
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,233
The corpse eater
needs a tick to prepare.

402
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,802
She'll be here tomorrow
at sundown.

403
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,139
Oh, and you're welcome.

404
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,558
The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

405
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,287
But Penny
still has his tether.

406
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,758
I'm not a ghost!

407
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,458
KADY: If he's a ghost,
shouldn't he be,

408
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,957
I don't... I don't know,
haunting us?

409
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,664
What if something else
happened?

410
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,932
Yes, something else
did happen!

411
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,771
ALICE: It can take decades for
a spirit to become malevolent.

412
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,509
Corpse eaters
are a rare creature.

413
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,602
If the Librarians
actually have one,

414
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,912
not just some sicko
who wants a free meal,

415
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,951
you should use it.

416
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,481
But what if there's a way
to fix him?

417
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,750
To bring him back?

418
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,485
ALICE: Without magic?

419
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,288
Julia has magic.

420
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,855
Okay, not much, but I...

421
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,260
It's just, I... I...
I can't wrap my head around

422
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,497
sending him to work for the
Library for a billion years.

423
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,532
I don't trust them.

424
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,505
There you go. Come on, Kady.

425
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,167
The Underworld's not so bad.

426
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,604
Quentin says
there's a bowling alley.

427
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,807
And a billion years surrounded
by books sounds like Heaven.

428
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,142
PENNY: Damn it, Alice.

429
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,841
I thought we were bros.

430
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,978
Ah. Let go, let go, let go!

431
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,785
My God!

432
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,889
I was only trying to follow
the story.

433
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,656
No, what Julia does
in the bath is not story!

434
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,562
It is revealing of character.

435
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,034
Listen, I need to talk
to Kady somehow today.

436
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,863
Okay?

437
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,565
Now, I don't give a shit
if it didn't end well

438
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,972
for you in the past.
You are going to help me.

439
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:02,806
Or I will cock block you
for the rest of time.

440
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,877
<i>0K3'! -</i>

441
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,018
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

442
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,923
I spent months
trying to push things.

443
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,388
I never got anywhere.

444
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,689
Until I tried
being the thing.

445
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,593
Uh...

446
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,929
(EXHALES)

447
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,700
Okay, focus on a penny.

448
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,330
(LAUGHS)

449
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,608
Get it? 'Cause of your name'?
You get it.

450
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,605
Now, you're not gonna try
to move the penny.

451
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,345
You're gonna try to be it.

452
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,207
So pour yourself
into its shape.

453
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,110
Inhabit it
with your whole being.

454
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,747
Hmm?

455
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,117
Go ahead.

456
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,852
Be the penny.
Okay.

457
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,625
I got this.

458
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,555
Be the penny.

459
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,727
<i>Just be the goddamn penny!</i>

460
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,788
Penny, just be it!
(STUTTERS)

461
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,265
What does that even mean?

462
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,529
You're getting confused
by the whole Penny thing.

463
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,037
Maybe we should have started
with a nickel.

464
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,095
Wha...
Huh? Be the nickel!

465
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,368
Maybe you shouldn't say
the same dumb shit

466
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,876
over and over!

467
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,606
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you're a dullard!

468
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,644
A real dunce, I say!

469
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,317
You are worth less
than a penny,

470
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,908
and a penny is worthless!

471
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:16,976
(SCREAMS)

472
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,212
Um...

473
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,985
PENNY; This is weird.

474
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,322
(GASPS) You are the penny.

475
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,257
What do I do now?
I can't move.

476
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,230
Well, how could you?
You don't have any feet.

477
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,231
(PENNY GRUNTS)

478
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,968
What are you...
What are you doing?

479
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,129
It sounds like you're pooping.

480
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,633
Holy zerts! You did it!
(CHUCKLES)

481
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,410
(GAGGING)
on.

482
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,078
I still have the taste
of pennies in my mouth.

483
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,949
Wait, why... Why don't l...

484
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,290
Why don't I just project
myself into my own body?

485
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,619
I know how to be that.

486
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,284
The only reason
you're still alive

487
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,919
is because you were astral
projecting when you died.

488
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,358
So if you go back
into your corpse,

489
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,831
you'll just be dead.

490
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,101
I need something bigger.

491
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,498
I need something
that can talk.

492
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,467
Yeah, hey, be careful.

493
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,373
Controlling things with brains
is much harder.

494
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,377
PENNY: Be the bunny.

495
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,941
(EXHALES) Be the bunny.

496
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,646
Be the bunny.
MARGO: It won't work.

497
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,282
Fairy Queen bitch
thinks she can break me

498
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,817
with a few days' time
out on Eliot's party boat?

499
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,865
Your Majesty, upon our return
to Whitespire,

500
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:39,460
might I suggest a hot bath
to relax yourself?

501
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:44,167
I can't, because that chalky
twat won't get out of my tub.

502
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,003
Keep waiting for
Eliot to come back.

503
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,972
But maybe he never will.

504
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,213
That bunny I sent him
was returned to sender.

505
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,909
For all I know, he's dead.

506
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,021
And him and Penny are blowing
each other in Heaven.

507
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,423
Now, when I get back...

508
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,196
I'm gonna fix this.

509
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,360
Benedict, you're gonna
round up the guards.

510
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,335
Tick, you're gonna go to that
fairy-repelling hallway

511
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,205
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

512
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,007
You're gonna put it
in the Fairy Queen's bath

513
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,575
and when that knocks her
on her ass,

514
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,374
I'm gonna cutout her heart
and eat it

515
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,683
in front of every goddamn
fairy asshole in the kingdom.

516
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,950
Damn. Girl, you get shit done.

Hyman was a perv.

Bethe Margolem.

520
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,486
Bethe Margolem.

Uh, um... Um, announcement.

522
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,719
You guys remember
the Margolem?

523
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,922
Margo's doppelganger
made of living clay?

524
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,922
Since Margo's been gone,
I've been storing it.

525
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,558
You know, for safekeeping?

526
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,563
Ew.
That's problematic.

527
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,933
TODD: It's not like that.

528
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,803
I just dress her up
and pretend she respects me.

529
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,270
Anyways, she's been out of
commission since magic died,

530
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,937
only...
(MARGOLEM GROANS)

531
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,748

00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,576
Fuck.

(BOTH YELLING)

537
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,137
I told you
it wouldn't end well.

538
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,701
You know' I wish
you weren't dead

539
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,638
so I could kill you.

540
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,443
DEAN: <i>So, this Margo/em
must've had</i>

541
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,280
some residual magic
left in her.

542
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,321
Or the living clay she was made
of was a magical creature?

543
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,183
Uh, anyway, while we
have you here,

544
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,554
we found Lance Morrison's
Brakebill records.

545
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,719
Um... It says that he was only
a student for a semester.

546
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,157
But it also says
in this file that he left

547
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,460
because of a "code seven"

548
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,898
Student suicide.

549
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,831
Or he magically exploded.

550
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,064
I don't know why they use
the same damn code for both.

551
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,338
Okay, either way,
he died on campus.

552
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,240
So the key might still
be here, right?

553
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,811
But it says he was living
in the West Dorm,

554
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,141
and there is
no such thing, so...

555
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,305
That's because it's buried.

556
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,371
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

557
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,506
DEAN: In the late 1940s,

558
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,052
there was a haunting
in the West Dorm.

559
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,985
At the time,
it was considered bad form

560
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,751
to have a ghost on campus.

561
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:50,355
Unlike today, where we put it
in the goddamn brochure.

562
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,397
"That ghost"
is gonna kill them.

563
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,060
To death, Penny.

564
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,156
So, the Dean buried
the whole dorm.

565
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,031
Magically protected
the entrances

566
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,365
so that students
couldn't find it.

567
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,669
But magic is gone.
So we can walk right in.

568
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,831
Right?

569
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,036
What are you gonna do?

570
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,203
Nothing.

571
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,207
It's not my problem.

They' re your friends.
Who I can't help in any way.

573
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,375

00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,581
You're dead already.

577
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,123
You're so dumb, Penny.

00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,963
Terrorized me for a week.

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,396
Wait a minute.

582
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,697
If they can hurt us, then...
Then they can see us.

589
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,444
Did my father send you?

coming home for winter.

592
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,682
We need to talk.

593
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:35,121
You need to tell them that Penny
is in the room with them.

00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,928
What are you talking about?

595
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,958
No, lam not a bitch!

596
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,004
Well, we don't think that.
Right, no, of course.

597
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:44,006

about a golden key

Rupert Chatwin gave you?

to where you've been.

From Fillory. Here.

Take it.

It won't hurt.

609
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,358
It just reveals the honest
truth of things.

610
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,700
Shows them as they truly are.

was tell the truth.

You say my name,

broken this ride.

to the Underworld.

Oh, hell no.

652
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,826
Then he'll be stuck there
for eternity,

653
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,794
turning into a ghost,
or worse.

654
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,602
KADY: She says,
"Better than a slave

Am I the only one that
knows that eternity

is a lot longer
than a billion years?

00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,710
Lance said his mom
was a McAllistair.

661
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,448
Well, that would explain
how he got into Brakebills.

662
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,786
The McAllistairs are
on the board of trustees.

663
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,850
They're one of the oldest
magical families in America.

664
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,155
Lance's father held the key.

665
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,890
I mean, he knew
how powerful it was.

666
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,191
That it would reveal truth.

667
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,289
It would show things
that were hidden.

668
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,858
So, he would have kept it.

669
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,699
Except that he would have
died by now, so...

670
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,568
Wait, could you get us
into that house?

671
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,136
Maybe.

672
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,803
Irene McAllistair's been
calling me every day

673
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,742
looking for a lead
on the magic.

674
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,141
Perhaps if we could
give her something

675
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,240
that she really wants...

676
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:19,685
Hey, have you been paying attention
to Quentin's stupid key thing?

677
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,588
Have I?
Yeah, great, shut up.

678
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,250
The ghost said it has
the power to reveal things

679
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,589
that are hidden.

680
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,228

Okay, tonight it'll be
seven days since I died.

If I don't contact Kady today,

684
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,101
she is either gonna
burn my corpse,

685
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,231
or worse,
give it to the Library.

686
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,738
I'm not getting eaten.

687
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,844
You know, Q said Eliot already
found one of those keys.

688
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,870
Okay, simple plan.

689
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,042
We use the key to make
a Shadow Bat monster illusion

690
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,551
like that priest did
on that island.

691
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,253
We scare away the bad men,
we get to a book chute,

692
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,051
we find a door,
and we get the hell out.

693
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,250
Okay.
Okay.

694
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,127

698
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,135
What have I done?

are you wearing?

This is your father?
Hi, Grandpa.

703
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,555
What is with everyone
and their daddy issues today?

704
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,989
Dressed like that'
everyone's gonna know

705
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,991
you haven't worked
a day in your life.

706
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,117
It's just an illusion.

707
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,389
I didn't think you could make

708
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,261
a sailor's uniform
look gayer.

709
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,266
My God.
It's just an illusion.

00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,893
Eliot, you might be the only
person in the multiverse

711
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,164
more fucked than me.

712
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,397
You're just an illusion.

713
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,000

It is so good to see you!

717
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,012
I was so happy
when you called.

718
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,815
Yeah. Irene,
these are my students.

719
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,412
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

720
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,651
Come on in.

721
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,431
Okay, there's some real
Beauty and the Beast

722
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,970
kind of stuff happening here.

723
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,528
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

724
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,369
Well, the house's
enchantments run

When he was a child,
there was a blackout

727
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,380
that lasted for months.

728
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,142
So he wanted to be prepared.

729
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,214
Please, come.
Follow me.

730
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,288
Unfortunately,
they won't last.

731
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,384
Most of the enchantments
have failed already.

732
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,519
Which is why I was so intrigued
by your call, Henry.

733
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,559
Would you like a martini?

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,672
Thank you.

737
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,174
Thank you.

738
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,249
So, which one of you
can do magic?

Um...

740
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:10,925
Well, I, um...

741
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,922
So, before I knew about magic,
real magic,

742
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:18,695
I... I used to do a lot
of sleight of hand tricks.

743
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:24,036
So, it turns out that
I wasn't very good at it.

744
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:29,539
I was cheating,
by using translocation spells

745
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,080
without really knowing it.

746
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:36,910
I don't know why, but, um,
those tricks still work.

00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,059
Not at all useful, but, uh.-.

751
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,258
I can do more.

752
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,392

It's been six
and a half days.

759
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,778

Honestly, why do you care?

769
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,942
He was my friend.

770
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,338
He wasn't one of you.

771
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,013
You're right.
I barely knew Penny.

772
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,846
I don't know
where he was from,

773
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,387
I don’t know
about his family,

774
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,617
I don't know... I don't know
how he found magic.

775
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,562
But I know what it's like
to be trapped

776
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,295
and to totally lose control
of yourself and your life.

777
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,070
But in the Underworld,

778
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,962
he still gets to be Penny.

779
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,734
Dammit, Alice, I'm still me.

780
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:50,270
It took everything I had

781
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,608
to try to save his life.

782
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,982
And then

783
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,749
he died anyway.

784
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,817
And then, I...
And then I was relieved.

785
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,585
To be done.

786
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,766
If Penny was here...

787
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,436
If he could tell us
what he wanted...

788
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,300
But he's not.

789
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,932
Okay, look, they're both
terrible options,

790
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,602
but if I had to choose,

791
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,576
please don't send me
to the Underworld.

792
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,617
I know you don't want
the responsibility.

793
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,781
So don't take it.

794
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,681
Let me.

795
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,157
No, Kady, please.

797
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,463

Okay, then I will

804
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,840
pass on touching it.

00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,169

chapter three.

So, the cannibals blocked
our only point of egress.

00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,503

to use the key,

didn't know the difference
between a tractor

to set them straight.

It was very cathartic.

There was lots of screaming
on both sides.

right past them.
