359
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,224
We think that Rupert Chatwin
brought one back to Earth

360
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:32,861
and gave it to an American
soldier that he served with

361
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,129
in World War II.

362
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,297
His name was Lance Morrison.

363
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:37,900
And it turns out that after the war,

364
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,236
Lance went to a magic school.

365
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,904
- Breakbills.
- Right.

366
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:46,240
So if there are any records
from the late 1940s,

367
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,364

bottom drawer.

374
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:07,594

Sorry to be blunt, but did
Penny die a traumatic death?

378

Dean Fogg said you were the one to ask.

379
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,610
Yes, it was traumatic.

380
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,847
That explains it.

381
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,282
Penny signed a contract with The Order,

382
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:33,453
guaranteeing his services in
this life and, well, beyond.

383
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:37,429
Curiously, his soul never reported for
service to our Underworld branch.

384
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,260
- Then where is he?
- I'm right here.

385
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,528
Likely in the process
of becoming a vengeful spirit.

Best to nip that in the bud
before his time is up.

What do you mean?

388
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:49,201
The soul is tethered to the
body for seven days after death.

389
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:52,238
We can use that tether to yank
Penny's soul out from wherever

390
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:53,272
and send him on his way.

391
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,976
- How?
- Eat him, naturally.

392
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:59,119
Oh, sweetheart, I'm not gonna eat him.

I'm a pescatarian.

394
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,475
The Order has retained
the services of a Corpse Eater

395
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:06,952
- for situations such as this.
- No one is eating my body, okay?

396
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,764
I'm not... done with it yet.

Kind of a ticking clock on this.

398

If the tether goes before Penny's
soul passes on, he's right...

399
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,328

a tick to prepare.

The ghost children at the
Plover house couldn't be saved.

403
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,913
But Penny still has his tether.

Yes, something else did happen!
