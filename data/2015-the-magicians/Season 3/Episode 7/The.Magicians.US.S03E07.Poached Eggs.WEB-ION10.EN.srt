<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:09,730
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,566
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:13,582
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:15,217
<i>I'll go to Fillory on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:17,353
That girl you saw in the
dungeon... we'll get her out.

7
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:19,031
Victoria.

8
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,109
You found me.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,173
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:23,155
No, I have to put myself back together.

11
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,252
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:26,806
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:28,140
No.

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,842
The fairies aren't just terraforming,

15
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:31,504
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:33,069
We need a plan bigger than

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,576
just assassinating the Queen. We need...

18
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,415
Hostages, leverage. Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:38,518
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:40,752
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

21
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:45,757
They don't just make portals.
They are portals.

22
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,526
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:50,662
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

24
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,831
If I could give it to you, I would.

25
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,833
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

26
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:57,002
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,503
Ah... Alice!

28
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:01,606
Okay, someone's gotta hear this, please.

29
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:09,272
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:12,155
The little weirdo wouldn't go to sleep
until I read him a bedtime story.

31
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,619
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

32
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:16,521
Q's probably already at the tree.

33
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,989
Tick, how are we doing?

34
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:20,458
Five minutes till
the fairy guards change shifts,

35
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:21,793
Your Majesties.

36
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:25,030
Now, no one knows we're gone, okay?

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,633
If the Fairy Queen asks, we're
bedridden with something contagious.

38
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:29,967
Like chicken pox.

39
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,636
Certainly, Highness. But must you leave?

40
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:34,362
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat... difficult.

41
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:36,407
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

42
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,309
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

43
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,644
that this land is now theirs.

44
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:42,680
They've been, well, pillaging... a lot.

45
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,815
I-I thought perhaps a royal address...

46
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,316
You're thinking too small.

47
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:48,886
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

48
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,821
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

49
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,490
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,492
But we can't deal with the Floaters

51
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:59,437
until we deal with the Fairies, got it?

52
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,931
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

53
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,500
to send you to the Underworld.

54
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,668
That is so cool.

55
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,269
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

56
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:09,105
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

57
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:11,241
Ah, I hear she's kinda withholding.

58
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,596
And judge-y.

59
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:15,146
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able to help us?

60
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,994
There's no "us." I'm gonna
go talk to Penny alone,

61
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,556
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

62
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,331
you were willing to backstab me for.

63
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,735
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

64
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,069
Q!

65
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,770
Oh, good.

66
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,107
Hey, I don't know if it was just,
like, a super anxious rabbit,

67
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,325
but your message made
things seem kinda...

68
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,344
Dire? They are.

69
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,012
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

70
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,448
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Poppy.

71
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,016
I'm helping Quentin find the next key.

72
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,019
- No, she's not helping me. We're...
- Okay, can we hit pause on the recap

73
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,854
until we're back
where our pasty usurpers

74
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,856
won't kill us all?

75
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,704
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,974
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

77
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,043
Alice, can you hear me?

79
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,722
I told you, I'm fine.

80
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,955
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

81
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,225
I expected this, okay?

82
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:27,495
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

83
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,598
There are occasional surges.

84
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:30,966
That's all this was.

85
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:33,267
I mean, was that all this was? A surge?

86
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:36,571
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

87
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,573
of organ transplant protection.

88
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,908
Attacking itself to get
rid of the invader.

89
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,911
Or maybe it's nothing at all. Who knows?

90
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:45,113
Who knows?

91
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,814
Well, we need a better answer than that.

92
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,984
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

93
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,753
I have no idea what's going to happen.

94
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,322
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

95
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,757
Energy-balancing spells, exercises...

96
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,458
I suppose that could work.

97
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,427
Your confidence is overwhelming.

98
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:02,129
What's the point of lying?

99
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,975
You people are just going to do
what you do, regardless...

100
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,811
Q.

101
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,943
Okay, you go get the key, I got this.

102
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,612
No, I'm gonna stay here and help.

103
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:22,982
I don't think more is merrier here.

104
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,452
I don't know... didn't you notice
your ex is a little...

105
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,954
Stubborn.

106
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:29,889
I noticed.

107
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,458
Alice and I got into this together.

108
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,360
I'll get us out, one way or another.

109
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,693
And I will make sure that she's okay.

110
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:38,731
Okay?

111
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,200
Go get the key while you still can.

112
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,978
We're all kinda counting on you
to bring back all of magic.

113
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:49,175
So you lost your key in the Underworld

114
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:52,144
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

115
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,813
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

116
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:58,317
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

117
00:04:58,327 --> 00:04:59,751
I'm an astral projection.

118
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:03,321
No offense, but your corpse is ash,

119
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:06,825
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

120
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:09,728
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

121
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:11,997
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

122
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,082
Yeah.

123
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,733
And I burned my body to avoid that.

124
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,868
Look, if we do not get to the Underworld

125
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:20,004
before Benedict moves on...
whatever that means...

126
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:22,607
then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

127
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:23,774
That's not my problem.

128
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:25,843
No magic is everyone's problem.

129
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:29,414
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

130
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,908
Especially to you?

131
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,959
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

132
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,353
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

133
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:37,688
is at stake.

134
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,532
Fine. I'll help.

135
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:43,694
But it's not like I can
just Travel to the Underworld.

136
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:45,362
So we need a gatekeeper.

137
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,932
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

138
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:50,467
What about the Library's dragon?

139
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:52,436
Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.

140
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,238
At least one side of the convo, anyway.

141
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,972
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:59,643
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

143
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:02,517
I read about it during dissertation
research. I assume it's real.

144
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,055
Ask your invisible friend.

145
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,050
Yeah, apparently.

146
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,485
I hear they use it to send

147
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:09,919
books to and from the Underworld.

148
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:11,320
'Cause dragons are portals, right?

149
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,557
Yeah, exact... ha...
the Bookwyrm's too small

150
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,592
to send a full-size person down there.

151
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:19,270
Well, what if the person was a book?

152
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, you said you can project
into objects, right?

153
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,235
Yeah, I did... did say that, didn't I?

154
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,138
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

155
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:33,609
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

156
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,244
it's stuck in the Satellite Library,

157
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:36,979
which is on another planet, so...

158
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:41,116
So, we need another Traveler.

159
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,584
- Um.
- Oh.

160
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:43,952
I only know one.

161
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,021
And she got grabbed by
the Beast in Fillory.

162
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,956
Victoria, she was in my class.

163
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,658
Wait a minute, you know Victoria?

164
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,593
Of course you know her, you... um...

165
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,262
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

166
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,098
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

167
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:57,465
I have no idea where she is.

168
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,934
If she's on Earth, I can find her.

169
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:02,437
On one condition... I wanna come.

170
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,673
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

171
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:06,708
This could be my only shot.

172
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,677
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

173
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,687
This doesn't make us friends, you know.

174
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:18,352
Discover anything useful for Alice?

175
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:22,456
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

176
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,991
on combining immunosuppressants

177
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,627
with a crystal-based healing ritual.

178
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,065
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

179
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,167
Not long ago, you wanted magic so badly

180
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:36,069
you fought through a memory wipe.

181
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,412
And now...

182
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,973
It's complicated. Uh... and personal.

183
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:43,577
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled Millennial bullshit."

184
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:45,686
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

185
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,814
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

186
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:48,915
You don't know that.

187
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,416
I know a lot more than you.

188
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,152
You're drunk, and you're mean.

189
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,995
And I'm right.

190
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,691
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

191
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,660
It doesn't fit Alice.

192
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,162
If she keeps it, she'll die.

193
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:04,597
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

194
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,099
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

195
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:09,810
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

196
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,541
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

197
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:18,544
Alice has it all. She'll never do it.

198
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:20,112
Well, fine. Go get some.

199
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:22,414
Oh, sure, I'll just pop over
to the store.

200
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:25,117
Actually, I think I may know someone

201
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,019
who may be of assistance.

202
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,021
But given their naked opportunism,

203
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,223
I can't imagine it'll come free.

204
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,441
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

205
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:35,027
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

206
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:37,404
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

207
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,800
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

208
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,535
We had the most wonderful adventure.

209
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,405
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

210
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:47,572
And it's always light.

211
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,374
A man urinated next to me.

212
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:51,877
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broad Way.

213
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,979
You call it "Cats," but it's
just humans in cat greasepaint.

214
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:57,882
And we tried a delicacy called pizza

215
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:02,120
at an eatery that was "Family Style."

216
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,324
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

217
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,558
Hi, Todd.

218
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:08,993
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

219
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:11,796
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy anything at all?

220
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:15,499
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

221
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,335
I do want you to like things, you know.

222
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:22,306
I can tell you want to be a good father.

223
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,909
It's sort of sweet.

224
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,911
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

225
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:30,347
- With time.
- Oh.

226
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:32,782
Let's go with that.

227
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,284
Not to interrupt this Hallmark moment,

228
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:36,361
but Todd, you got a sec?

229
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:39,264
Yeah.

230
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:43,493
Wait, fairies are real?

231
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:46,596
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought Fray was just nuts.

232
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,431
I mean, she is, but yeah,

233
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,032
they're real and they're raging dicks,

234
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:51,968
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

235
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:55,772
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

236
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,419
Just make sure Fray doesn't see 'em,

237
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,943
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

238
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:02,386
I've got another job for you.

239
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:06,115
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

240
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,150
What's with the feathers?

241
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,853
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

242
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,621
- to the Fairy Queen.
- Mmm...

243
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,191
Okay. As long as she bought it.

244
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,692
Everyone in the castle did.

245
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:19,160
Even Prince Fomar
and the Stone Queen headed back

246
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,563
to their mountain/island.

247
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,966
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

248
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:27,469
Well, that's good news, right?

249
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,805
So what's with the face?

250
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,294
Well, this just took a dark turn.

251
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:52,051
In exchange for my babies,
you want... my bathtub?

252
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,353
You collect toes and eyeballs,

253
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:55,088
and you think that's weird?

254
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:58,692
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

255
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:01,227
curious act of extortion.

256
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:05,265
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

257
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,866
on the side of the road.

258
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,936
We thought you'd be alarmed by that too,

259
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:13,706
given you forced us into that alliance.

260
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,442
So what's it gonna be? Your bathtub?

261
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:19,878
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

262
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,515
It's a strange deal.

263
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,834
Even for me.

264
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,003
Right.

265
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:28,020
I should be more specific.

266
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,455
You're giving your bathtub

267
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,957
to the entire population of Fillory.

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,626
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

269
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,061
It'll be fun.

270
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:40,265
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

271
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:43,568
everyone will then be able to see us.

272
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,237
I suppose you're right.

273
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,872
No more shadow-puppeting.

274
00:11:46,882 --> 00:11:49,774
Just straight-up puppeting, from now on.

275
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:52,109
Or hey, you could leave.

276
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,546
There is another option, you know.

277
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:57,415
I find my children, and then...

278
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,916
You have till tomorrow.

279
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,052
So have fun on the little egg hunt,

280
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:02,554
'cause if you don't make this deal,

281
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:03,888
we're about to boil and dye 'em

282
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:06,157
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

283
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:09,101
I don't know what that means.

284
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,896
So, if I understand you correctly,

285
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:15,432
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

286
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:19,436
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

287
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:20,938
Because I need your help.

288
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,606
Well, why should I trust you now?

289
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,940
You've already lied to me once.

290
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,776
She's lied to me several times too.

291
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,911
So at least you know it's not personal.

292
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,312
Like it wasn't personal

293
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,782
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

294
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,117
without so much as texting me first.

295
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,787
Henry, trust me, better me than them.

296
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,121
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

297
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:42,926
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

298
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,328
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

299
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,030
Limited reserves.

300
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,366
I just need a little bit.

301
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,800
I gave what I had to a friend.

302
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,803
- Why the hell would you do that?
- But it is killing her.

303
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:57,147
So without your help, she will
die and so will the magic.

304
00:12:58,484 --> 00:12:59,983
All right.

305
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,322
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

306
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:08,818
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

307
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:10,553
You knew about this?

308
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:11,887
I thought I was very clear

309
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:14,023
about not looking in the cubbyhole.

310
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,325
You were. That's why I looked.

311
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,692
Fray, what are those?

312
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:20,029
Fairy eggs. That Father and Margo took.

313
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,997
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

314
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:25,867
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

315
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:28,369
The Fairy Queen stole you from us.

316
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,972
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

317
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:35,577
It was a fair deal.
This... is kidnapping.

318
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:39,981
Unlike you, we have honor.

319
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:43,017
You're not a fairy, Fray.

320
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:46,554
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

321
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,823
as anything but a human?

322
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,325
Because she won't.

323
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,859
That's not true.

324
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:55,997
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

325
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,865
That's pretty cold.

326
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,367
Humans are complicated.

327
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,836
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

328
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,171
Yeah, like, I once donated a kidney

329
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,906
to this girl I really liked.

330
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,441
Only, it turned out she didn't actually

331
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,076
need it for a transplant.

332
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:13,388
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

333
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,725
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

334
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:23,064
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

335
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,734
Family is about loyalty, my love.

336
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,377
Fuck you!

337
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,909
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

338
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,711
<i>She slept with Josh.</i>

339
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,212
On our Fillorian spring break.

340
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:47,747
While he and I were still dating.

341
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:49,616
Are you really still upset about Josh?

342
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:52,418
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

343
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:53,585
Yeah, do you not get that

344
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:54,953
that only makes it more fucked up?

345
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,622
Sorry, could we just focus for a second?

346
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,224
It's just kind of important.

347
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:01,590
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

348
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,794
I still wouldn't help you.

349
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:04,430
'Cause I don't trust you.

350
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,173
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

351
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:15,073
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

352
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,509
I know. It's just not that simple, okay?

353
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,578
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

354
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,112
Group?

355
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:24,015
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

356
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:27,118
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

357
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,620
It's just... we got something going on.

358
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,589
Wait, is your boss, um...

359
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:36,428
is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

360
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:39,597
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriett person,

361
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,965
can... can you get her to help?

362
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,667
Uh, she doesn't exactly

363
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,301
- like me.
- Great.

364
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,838
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

365
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,540
So it makes perfect sense.

366
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,676
Some people are just so emotional.

367
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:55,312
Harriet does like Kady, though.

368
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,382
Okay, great, then let's talk to Kady.

369
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,816
Where is she?

370
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,361
Shit.

371
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,004
Kady.

372
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,901
All right, I can help you.

373
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,070
But you'll owe me a favor.

374
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,072
Uh, what's the favor?

375
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,149
To be determined.

376
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,244
- Trust her.
- What could go wrong?

377
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,512
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

378
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,080
It was buy the place

379
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,349
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

380
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,853
and turn this place into a...
an amusement park.

381
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,087
At least I care.

382
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,297
You care about something.

383
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,535
Do we have a deal?

384
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,768
Is that cocaine?

385
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,105
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

386
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,806
But yes, you will have to snort it.

387
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,275
I'm sorry, what creature?

388
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,377
I thought you had batteries.

389
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,111
Look, you asked me for my help.

390
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:05,188
This is what I have to offer.

391
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,950
Okay, Kady is in the High Risk Ward,

392
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,284
down the hallway over here.

393
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,653
The ward is locked. So is Kady's room.

394
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,489
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

395
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,324
Okay.

396
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,960
Those squiggles are guards?

397
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,660
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

398
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,262
Gotcha.

399
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,298
So, how are we gonna get in
past all the security?

400
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,134
We're not.
They are gonna bring her to us.

401
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,269
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

402
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,472
- for more than 15 days...
- They have to bring in

403
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,640
outside doctors to certify she's crazy.

404
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,943
Yeah, and, uh, we will be those doctors.

405
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:37,311
They'll buy that?

406
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,247
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

407
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,669
No, it's like a state hospital.

408
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,904
Yeah, their computer systems
are older than we are.

409
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:46,175
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

410
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,243
Good thinking.

411
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,845
Should I be concerned that you
both know so much about this?

412
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:53,723
Mm... There was a "crazy" time.

413
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:56,618
Okay, whatever, uh...

414
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:59,888
But it's not like you two can just
walk out of there with a patient.

415
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:02,558
No, but Kady can walk herself out

416
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,467
if she has a security badge.

417
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:09,097
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

418
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:10,906
No, I will.

419
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,645
Here we are.

420
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:27,147
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr....

421
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:29,483
Kline. Midtown Mental Health Clinic.

422
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,886
Which is where we work.

423
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:34,956
Yes. We're here to do an evaluation.

424
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:37,499
Great. Mind if I sit in?

425
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,505
No, not at all. Please do.

426
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:52,139
Okay, um, so, Kady, um...

427
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,343
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

428
00:18:56,353 --> 00:19:01,481
from delusions, and that you've
been talking to someone

429
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,592
named, uh... Penny?

430
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:07,621
Oh, um, yeah.

431
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:10,323
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

432
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,658
We're breaking you out of here.

433
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:13,827
Kady, can you tell us about Penny?

434
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:18,105
Yeah, uh, yeah, he was a... my ex.

435
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,933
But I-I don't see him anymore.

436
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:22,801
Quentin's gonna hand you
a security badge.

437
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,370
It'll get you out of the ward.

438
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,105
When you're on break, in the day room,

439
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:29,116
use it to sneak out. We'll be waiting.

440
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:39,551
Oh, someone has lost their badge.

441
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,356
Great.

442
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,858
What now?

443
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,692
What if she doesn't take the deal?

444
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,461
Then what do we do? Or, no...

445
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,297
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

446
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:53,532
Stop it.

447
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,333
It's going to be fine.

448
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:56,296
We could cut our losses.

449
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:57,969
We could head back to Earth and regroup.

450
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,738
We could finish the quest,
restore magic,

451
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,474
and then maybe revisit this

452
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,142
when we stand a fighting chance.

453
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:08,179
You and I both sacrificed
a lot for Fillory.

454
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,682
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

455
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,825
to the albino supermodel?

456
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:15,753
Bitch took my eye.

457
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:18,756
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

458
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:21,266
But what if we're making things worse?

459
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:29,169
There wasn't a blood test to
tell me to be High Queen.

460
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,272
I chose it.

461
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:35,406
And I have had to fight for
every shred of authority.

462
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,074
And no offense,

463
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:40,744
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

464
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:44,247
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

465
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:47,584
Those fairy bitches wanna come
for my crown, well...

466
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:53,031
I'll shove it up their fucking eggholes.

467
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,628
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

468
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,563
I'm on board.

469
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:05,535
Maybe try the key.

470
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:06,679
- What?
- Well, I don't know.

471
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,037
Like, wave it around or something.

472
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,706
Maybe a keyhole will appear in the wall.

473
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,774
This is stupid.

474
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,443
And I feel sick.

475
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:15,945
Why are you here anyway?

476
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,913
We already stuck a fork in this, Penny.

477
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,282
- We're helping you.
- All of a sudden?

478
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:24,895
After I was such a ray
of sunshine to you last time.

479
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:28,657
We need you to talk to Harriet.

480
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,426
We need her help getting the next key,

481
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:33,169
so we can bring magic back.

482
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,266
All right. And where's the next key?

483
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,635
In the Underworld.

484
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:42,345
I'm the only one who can get it, Kady.

485
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:44,973
You're doing it again, aren't you?

486
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:48,217
Throwing your life
at a problem to solve it.

487
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,954
I'm tired, Penny.

488
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:56,785
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

489
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,487
I thought we weren't a couple.

490
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:01,355
That's not funny.

491
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:04,032
It's a little funny.

492
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:08,929
Hey, yell at me.

493
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,799
I don't want to. I am tired of yelling.

494
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:13,100
Yell at me.

495
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,103
I'm getting you out of this room.

496
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:17,337
Come on!

497
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:20,207
Aah!

498
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,217
Aah!

499
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:25,140
Aah!

500
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,885
Okay, Kady.

501
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,886
Hand over the contraband.

502
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:35,430
What's up?

503
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:37,732
Uhh...

504
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:41,722
Go, team.

505
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:57,663
Alice, what're you doing here?

506
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,332
What are you?

507
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,512
I thought you were in a psych ward.

508
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:02,735
I was.

509
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,237
Now I'm the sanest woman in America.

510
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,706
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

511
00:23:08,084 --> 00:23:09,975
I actually can't really feel anything.

512
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,477
It's fantastic.

513
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,779
If I didn't know better, I would say

514
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,348
that you were just trying to cast

515
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:17,283
an intermediate unlocking charm.

516
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,285
That would mean that I have magic,

517
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:21,287
which we both know is impossible.

518
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:22,855
Right. Hmm.

519
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:25,791
Well, don't bother.
I already looted the place.

520
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:28,994
Brakebills may be closed.
Black market's not.

521
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:30,763
Gotta make a living.

522
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:33,465
You, uh, looking for something special?

523
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:37,203
Some Boswellia.

524
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,605
Bloodstone, steroids.

525
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:42,274
Fuck me.

526
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:43,709
So you do have magic.

527
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,810
What do you know about transplants?

528
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,379
I know you'd have to be desperate

529
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:49,656
to try something that stupid.

530
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:53,552
Well, who am I to judge?

531
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,962
I almost blew a werewolf
so he'd turn me.

532
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,056
Magical creatures...

533
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:01,500
they can hang on to their magic
just fine, so...

534
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,829
Please...

535
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,530
if you have anything that can help me...

536
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,200
Well, Boswellia and
Bloodstone are total bullshit.

537
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,670
But, uh, steroids might help a little.

538
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:17,141
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

539
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,977
It says take two. You should take eight.

540
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,346
- Thank you.
- We're all screwed anyway.

541
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,623
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, hmm?

542
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,218
<i>- Dr. Bailey,</i>

543
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:30,220
<i>you're needed at nurse's station 204.</i>

544
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,598
<i>- Dr. Bailey...</i>
- Nurse coming. Shh!

545
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:42,373
I know you don't wanna talk right now.

546
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,869
- I sure don't.
- Yeah, yeah, hate me later.

547
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,846
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

548
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:51,874
You're the best thing in my life.

549
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,285
Short life, granted, but...

550
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,547
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

551
00:24:57,557 --> 00:24:58,715
Well, you should.

552
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:01,551
It's crazy we lived this long.

553
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,786
We met. We had great sex.

554
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:05,830
I got to know you.

555
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,757
I'm lucky.

556
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,392
What's your point?

557
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:13,395
Don't be mad too long.

558
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:14,797
I want you to be happy.

559
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:18,234
Jesus Christ.

560
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:20,469
I can't be.

561
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,246
Without you, you fucking idiot.

562
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:26,734
But isn't that just adult life?

563
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:30,078
Accepting your own misery.

564
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:32,047
<i>- Code Green,</i>

565
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:34,916
Shit. I guess they found my room.

566
00:25:34,926 --> 00:25:36,417
Come on.

567
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:38,753
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

568
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,121
and the key locked up in there...

569
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,557
I know, I know. Quit being so twitchy.

570
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:43,825
You look suspicious.

571
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,760
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

572
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:49,231
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

573
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:51,333
<i>- Everyone stay in their room.</i>
- Oh, shit. Lockdown.

574
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:52,800
<i>And stay calm. We are on lockdown.</i>

575
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,135
We're gonna have to help her...

576
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:58,381
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

577
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,275
You sure this is gonna work?

578
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:02,643
It's fire safety protocol.

579
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:05,813
How do you not know that?

580
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,817
<i>Attention, please proceed
to the nearest fire exit</i>

581
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:13,854
<i>and evacuate immediately.</i>
See? Works every time.

582
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,689
How many times have you done this?

583
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,091
<i>And evacuate immediately.</i>

584
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,626
Keep it moving!

585
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,765
I told you we'd figure it out.

586
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,277
Oh, shit.

587
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,958
Come on, let's go.

588
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,791
Well.

589
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:53,826
Alice is gone.

590
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:55,995
Might be time to use this.

591
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,672
To cast a locator spell.

592
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,967
Ugh.

593
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:05,003
Reminds me of the old days.

594
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,371
I don't wanna know.

595
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:16,381
This magic... it looks different.

596
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:18,016
It feels different.

597
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:21,519
If it's working, let's not split hairs.

598
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:24,256
Find her.

599
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:28,060
Wait a minute. What's Alice doing there?

600
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,704
I'm blind. Are you going to tell me?

601
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,925
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

602
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,869
She was upset and tried to take them.

603
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:40,438
I stopped her, but she ran away
and we can't find her.

604
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:41,840
This is not good.

605
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,376
And real bad timing, El.

606
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,281
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

607
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,280
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

608
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,811
we need to put a pin in it. There's
nothing we can do about it right now.

609
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,887
- Perhaps I can help.
- Oh, Fray.

610
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:59,556
We've been having quite a talk.

611
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:03,194
Eggs and portals and quests.

612
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:06,429
So much going on I didn't know about.

613
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,586
We really should discuss.

614
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:11,142
Crap.

615
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:14,848
Fray? How could you?

616
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:19,594
Like you said, family loyalty.

617
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,965
I've considered your offer.

618
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:28,628
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

619
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,763
I won't hurt yours.

620
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:33,033
Wait. What?

621
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:35,050
- No.
- Don't you touch her.

622
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,768
But my Queen...

623
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:41,007
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

624
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:44,109
- No one needs to get hurt.
- I agree.

625
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,641
I... I helped you. I...

626
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:49,215
Yes.

627
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:54,595
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

628
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,766
Betrayed your own parents.

629
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:00,859
Why would I ever trust you?

630
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:05,172
I just... found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

631
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,800
I just wanted all this to stop.

632
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,502
So let's stop this.

633
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:18,978
We gotta give her the eggs.

634
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,546
There's gotta be another way.
That's our only leverage.

635
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:24,816
I know, but she's my daughter.

636
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:26,851
We have a whole country to think about.

637
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:29,996
I can't be the dad that turns
his back on his kid.

638
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:33,157
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

639
00:29:34,668 --> 00:29:37,503
- What're you saying?
- What?

640
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,848
Explain.

641
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,598
Now...

642
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:46,337
or it's poached eggs tonight.

643
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:52,848
Fray isn't yours.

644
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:56,680
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

645
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:00,137
She died?

646
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:02,808
Oh, gods, I...

647
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,886
Oh, no. Oh, no.

648
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:16,541
That is the sound
of your leverage dying.

649
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:21,628
You'd better shake on this deal
while you still can.

650
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:29,022
No, no way.

651
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:30,775
- Please.
- No.

652
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,678
I'm asking for this favor.

653
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,794
Okay, okay, look.

654
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:53,365
Look, I'm... I am grateful for
everything you did for me.

655
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,133
For Penny.

656
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,569
So how about this?

657
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,871
What if...

658
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,486
Then we both get what we want.

659
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:20,658
So we're gonna rob the Library?

660
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,860
- Oh, awesome.
- No, not awesome.

661
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,395
Stupid.

662
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:26,664
It is hard enough
to sneak one person in there.

663
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:28,700
How the hell are they gonna
get the whole group in?

664
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,168
It's the dumbest plan I've ever...

665
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,169
Uhh...

666
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,379
Uh, Penny's got some notes.

667
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:37,815
You said you wanted to do this.

668
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:40,118
You don't know
the defenses this place has.

669
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:42,021
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

670
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:45,231
Oh, are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

671
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:49,528
You've been waiting to say that.

672
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:51,653
I know what I'm doing.

673
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:53,690
My head's clear now.

674
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,825
You got me out. We'll get the key out.

675
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:58,828
You just... you have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

676
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:00,186
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

677
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:02,431
Being on the astral plane's great.

678
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,741
Just a little over being stuck here.

679
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:09,838
Bringing magic back is
the only way I see out of this.

680
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:15,485
Wouldn't it be funny
if we made it out of this?

681
00:32:16,154 --> 00:32:19,655
I'd laugh pretty hard.

682
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,819
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

683
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:27,288
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

684
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:30,058
Yeah, I heard that one before.

685
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:31,622
I love you.

686
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,471
I'm sorry we're cursed.

687
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,723
He's gone.

688
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,762
What, like, gone? Gone gone? Like...

689
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:52,146
Like, to the Library gone?

690
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:54,890
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

691
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:58,440
So let's not fuck it up on our end.

692
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:08,695
Are you sure you wanna do this?

693
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:10,731
It's not exactly like everyone thinks...

694
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,666
Jonesing for blood.

695
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:14,701
Watching everyone you know die.

696
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:18,037
That is, if you
don't kill them yourself.

697
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:20,774
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

698
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:24,844
You seem... smart.
Too smart to want all this.

699
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,412
I don't want it.

700
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,282
- Then why...
- It's none of your business.

701
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:32,351
Well, then, no.

702
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:35,646
Becoming a creature...
no offense... is the only way

703
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:37,223
I can keep my magic.

704
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:38,834
Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

705
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:41,044
I'm not. But are you so sure

706
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:42,361
this'll do what you want it to?

707
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:44,029
No, but I'm out of options,

708
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,898
so will you take my money or not?

709
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,977
All right.

710
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:01,646
Alice, let's go.

711
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:04,049
Jesus, how did you find me?

712
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,751
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

713
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,887
All I found were shitty vampires.

714
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,422
Can we please go?

715
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:13,566
No, just leave. Continue.

716
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:17,061
Ah!

717
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:18,630
Leave or I break it.

718
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,131
Ah! Get off me!

719
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,899
How did you do that?

720
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,935
Ah. Get out.

721
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,403
No, I gave you my money.

722
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:29,240
Not enough to deal with
hedgewitch Buffy. Good luck.

723
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,750
Out!

724
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,179
When we said we'd explore our options,

725
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:38,015
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

726
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,417
I researched. This is the only way.

727
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:42,619
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

728
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:46,932
Okay. I don't need your help,
you condescending bitch.

729
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,273
Aaaaaah!

730
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:02,339
Oh, no, Julia.

731
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,517
I transferred it all back.

732
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:21,913
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:21,923 --> 00:35:25,484
All you did was try to help me,
and I almost killed you.

734
00:35:25,494 --> 00:35:30,389
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

735
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,657
I guess we're even.

736
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,868
We're not,
but that's nice of you to say.

737
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:40,606
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

738
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,434
I mean, what do people in limbo do?

739
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,745
It's excruciating.

740
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:50,075
You know, and I just thought
maybe if I could just...

741
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:53,353
Fix it?

742
00:35:54,455 --> 00:35:56,355
I know the feeling.

743
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:59,759
Really.

744
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:03,654
I still see Reynard.

745
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,059
You do?

746
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,802
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

747
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,963
Do you think maybe it's because...

748
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:16,308
I think it's because it happened.

749
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,979
And there's nothing magic
about it anymore.

750
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:24,808
When things happen, they leave a mark.

751
00:36:24,818 --> 00:36:27,985
Figuring out how to deal
with it takes time.

752
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,850
I get what Quentin always saw in you.

753
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,827
You're brave.

754
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,888
Just stubborn.

755
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:40,857
I think that's why you can hold it.

756
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:43,993
All the pain, and all the shit
you didn't ask for,

757
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,629
that's what made you you.

758
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,632
And that's why this magic fits.

759
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:54,203
Maybe sometimes life is... random

760
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,738
and unfair.

761
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:59,008
You know, it doesn't always
ask our permission.

762
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:01,117
It just is.

763
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:04,755
Honestly...

764
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,359
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

765
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,998
Except that it's not his anymore, Julia.

766
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,962
I felt it. It... it's yours.

767
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,030
For whatever reason.

768
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,269
So what are you gonna do with it?

769
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:42,393
Fen.

770
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:45,471
Maybe you shouldn't be holding
sharp objects right now.

771
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:47,307
My father was a knife maker.

772
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:49,585
This is how I've always calmed down.

773
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:05,606
When our daughter was born,

774
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:08,408
they took her away.

775
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:12,554
They wouldn't let me hold her.
I never heard her cry.

776
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,316
I should have known.

777
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:18,451
How could I not know?

778
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:23,756
God, I was so ready to believe Fray.

779
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:26,426
I think deep down I thought...

780
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:33,900
If we just felt like a family,

781
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,470
if I just willed it hard enough,

782
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,104
then that would be real.

783
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:42,616
'Cause this...

784
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,578
How am I supposed to live with it?

785
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,680
Oh, God.

786
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,316
God, oh, Fen, I'm so sorry.

787
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:53,419
You would've been... um.

788
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:57,689
No, you were such a great mom.

789
00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:03,570
And... I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

790
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,827
You deserve so much better than this.

791
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,712
I'm gonna need some time.

792
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,540
I can't be in Fillory right now.

793
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,009
Okay, okay.

794
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:39,383
Hey.

795
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:42,724
Okay, dude. Spill.

796
00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:45,035
What's up?

797
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:49,002
What if... Penny doesn't find Benedict

798
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:52,576
or the Key? Or he gets caught
by a Librarian, or we do,

799
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:55,345
or any part
of this ridiculous plan fails?

800
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:57,815
It seems like you're worrying
about a lot of stuff

801
00:39:57,825 --> 00:39:59,182
you can't control, here.

802
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:03,186
Everything that we're doing,
if we mess it up,

803
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:06,356
it's not just me who suffers.

804
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:08,558
It's not just us who suffers.

805
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:11,528
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

806
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:13,196
No, it's not the multiverse.

807
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:14,931
Magic doesn't exist in this universe.

808
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:16,933
It doesn't mean it's gone
in alternate realities.

809
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:20,111
- That is not the point.
- Oh, boy.

810
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,211
What're you doing?

811
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:24,980
Short-circuiting your panic attack.

812
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:27,125
It's getting tiresome.

813
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:31,687
Okay, I'm confused.

814
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:34,023
It's sweet how much you care
about your friends.

815
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:35,992
Even the ones that don't like you.

816
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,559
Let's just have some fun.

817
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,229
Seems like the chances of
everyone surviving

818
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,231
go up if we do that.

819
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:45,776
Hmm?

820
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,449
<i>Your eggs, I take it, are fine?</i>

821
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,565
Yes.

822
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:02,807
What have you done with Fray?

823
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:05,130
She did not want to return with me.

824
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,730
Her fate is her own.

825
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,292
Is the rest done?

826
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,963
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

827
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,865
May they be clean forever.

828
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,735
I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift.

829
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,403
While we're at it.

830
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,905
What was your end game anyway?

831
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:29,277
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

832
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,713
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world

833
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,748
domination mega-villain" bullshit?

834
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,086
It's a sign of your human privilege

835
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,488
that you see things so simply.

836
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:44,558
Oh, but it is simple, Lady...
you made us look crazy.

837
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,460
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

838
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,296
But now everyone will understand

839
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,431
what was really happening to us.

840
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,768
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

841
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,970
Everyone can see you now.

842
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,473
True. And they can see you too.

843
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:03,618
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

844
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,680
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

845
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,182
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

846
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:11,851
for some time.

847
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:13,786
I can no longer help you.

848
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:16,622
Help us with what?

849
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:21,527
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

850
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:24,597
a little too "Les Miz" for my liking.

851
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:26,833
- Okay, Bambi? They're armed.
- Ah!

852
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:31,002
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

853
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:34,973
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

854
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:36,807
Ohh...

855
00:42:36,817 --> 00:42:38,509
Hold on! Hold on!

856
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:41,178
Aah! Aah!

857
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:44,423
I'm your Queen, you motherfuckers!
