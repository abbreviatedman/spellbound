00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,533
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,511
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,347
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:08,363
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:09,998
<i>I'll go to Fillory on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:12,134
That girl you saw in the
dungeon... we'll get her out.

7
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:13,812
Victoria.

8
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:14,890
You found me.

9
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:15,954
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,936
No, I have to put myself back together.

11
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:19,033
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:21,587
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:22,921
No.

14
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,623
The fairies aren't just terraforming,

15
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,285
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:27,850
We need a plan bigger than

17
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,357
just assassinating the Queen. We need...

18
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:31,196
Hostages, leverage. Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:33,299
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,533
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

21
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:40,538
They don't just make portals.
They are portals.

22
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,307
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:45,443
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

24
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,612
If I could give it to you, I would.

25
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:49,614
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

26
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:51,783
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:53,284
Ah... Alice!

28
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:56,387
Okay, someone's gotta hear this, please.

29
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:04,453
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,336
The little weirdo wouldn't go to sleep
until I read him a bedtime story.

31
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:09,800
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

32
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,702
Q's probably already at the tree.

33
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,170
Tick, how are we doing?

34
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,639
Five minutes till
the fairy guards change shifts,

35
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:16,974
Your Majesties.

36
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:20,211
Now, no one knows we're gone, okay?

37
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,814
If the Fairy Queen asks, we're
bedridden with something contagious.

38
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:25,148
Like chicken pox.

39
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,817
Certainly, Highness. But must you leave?

40
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:29,543
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat... difficult.

41
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:31,588
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

42
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,490
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

43
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,825
that this land is now theirs.

44
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:37,861
They've been, well, pillaging... a lot.

45
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:39,996
I-I thought perhaps a royal address...

46
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,497
You're thinking too small.

47
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:44,067
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

48
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:46,002
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

49
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:48,671
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

50
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,673
But we can't deal with the Floaters

51
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:54,618
until we deal with the Fairies, got it?

52
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:57,112
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

53
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:58,681
to send you to the Underworld.

54
00:01:58,691 --> 00:01:59,849
That is so cool.

55
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,450
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

56
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,286
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

57
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,422
Ah, I hear she's kinda withholding.

58
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:07,777
And judge-y.

59
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,327
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able to help us?

60
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,175
There's no "us." I'm gonna
go talk to Penny alone,

61
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:14,737
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

62
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:16,512
you were willing to backstab me for.

63
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:19,916
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

64
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,250
Q!

65
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,951
Oh, good.

66
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:26,288
Hey, I don't know if it was just,
like, a super anxious rabbit,

67
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,506
but your message made
things seem kinda...

68
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:29,525
Dire? They are.

69
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,193
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

70
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,629
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Poppy.

71
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,197
I'm helping Quentin find the next key.

72
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:38,200
- No, she's not helping me. We're...
- Okay, can we hit pause on the recap

73
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,035
until we're back
where our pasty usurpers

74
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,037
won't kill us all?

75
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,739
<i>♪ I've got all my life to live ♪</i>

76
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:45,907
<i>♪ I've got all my love to give ♪</i>

77
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,711
<i>♪ And I'll survive I will survive ♪</i>

78
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>♪ Hey hey ♪</i>

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,885
Oh, my God.

80
00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:00,155
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

81
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:03,224
Alice, can you hear me?

82
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,903
I told you, I'm fine.

83
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:18,136
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

84
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:19,406
I expected this, okay?

85
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,676
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

86
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,779
There are occasional surges.

87
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,147
That's all this was.

88
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:28,448
I mean, was that all this was? A surge?

89
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,752
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

90
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,754
of organ transplant protection.

91
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:36,089
Attacking itself to get
rid of the invader.

92
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:39,092
Or maybe it's nothing at all. Who knows?

93
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,294
Who knows?

94
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,995
Well, we need a better answer than that.

95
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,165
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

96
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,934
I have no idea what's going to happen.

97
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,503
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

98
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,938
Energy-balancing spells, exercises...

99
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,639
I suppose that could work.

100
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,608
Your confidence is overwhelming.

101
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,310
What's the point of lying?

102
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,156
You people are just going to do
what you do, regardless...

103
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,992
Q.

104
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,124
Okay, you go get the key, I got this.

105
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:13,793
No, I'm gonna stay here and help.

106
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:18,163
I don't think more is merrier here.

107
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,633
I don't know... didn't you notice
your ex is a little...

108
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,135
Stubborn.

109
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,070
I noticed.

110
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,639
Alice and I got into this together.

111
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,541
I'll get us out, one way or another.

112
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:32,874
And I will make sure that she's okay.

113
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:33,912
Okay?

114
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:36,381
Go get the key while you still can.

115
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:39,159
We're all kinda counting on you
to bring back all of magic.

116
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:44,356
So you lost your key in the Underworld

117
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,325
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

118
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:49,994
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

119
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:53,498
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

120
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:54,932
I'm an astral projection.

121
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:58,502
No offense, but your corpse is ash,

122
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:02,006
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

123
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,909
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

124
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,178
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

125
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:08,263
Yeah.

126
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,914
And I burned my body to avoid that.

127
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,049
Look, if we do not get to the Underworld

128
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,185
before Benedict moves on...
whatever that means...

129
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:17,788
then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

130
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:18,955
That's not my problem.

131
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,024
No magic is everyone's problem.

132
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:24,595
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

133
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,089
Especially to you?

134
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,140
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

135
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,534
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

136
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,869
is at stake.

137
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,713
Fine. I'll help.

138
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,875
But it's not like I can
just Travel to the Underworld.

139
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,543
So we need a gatekeeper.

140
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:43,113
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

141
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,648
What about the Library's dragon?

142
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,617
Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.

143
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:49,419
At least one side of the convo, anyway.

144
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,153
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:54,824
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

146
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,698
I read about it during dissertation
research. I assume it's real.

147
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,236
Ask your invisible friend.

148
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,231
Yeah, apparently.

149
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,666
I hear they use it to send

150
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,100
books to and from the Underworld.

151
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,501
'Cause dragons are portals, right?

152
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,738
Yeah, exact... ha...
the Bookwyrm's too small

153
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,773
to send a full-size person down there.

154
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:14,451
Well, what if the person was a book?

155
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:19,181
Well, you said you can project
into objects, right?

156
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,416
Yeah, I did... did say that, didn't I?

157
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:24,319
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

158
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:28,790
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

159
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,425
it's stuck in the Satellite Library,

160
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,160
which is on another planet, so...

161
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,297
So, we need another Traveler.

162
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:37,765
- Um.
- Oh.

163
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,133
I only know one.

164
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,202
And she got grabbed by
the Beast in Fillory.

165
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:43,137
Victoria, she was in my class.

166
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:44,839
Wait a minute, you know Victoria?

167
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,774
Of course you know her, you... um...

168
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,443
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

169
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:51,279
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

170
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,646
I have no idea where she is.

171
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:55,115
If she's on Earth, I can find her.

172
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,618
On one condition... I wanna come.

173
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:59,854
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

174
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:01,889
This could be my only shot.

175
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,858
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

176
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,868
This doesn't make us friends, you know.

177
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:13,533
Discover anything useful for Alice?

178
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:17,637
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

179
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,172
on combining immunosuppressants

180
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,808
with a crystal-based healing ritual.

181
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,246
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

182
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:29,348
Not long ago, you wanted magic so badly

183
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,250
you fought through a memory wipe.

184
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,593
And now...

185
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:35,154
It's complicated. Uh... and personal.

186
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,758
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled Millennial bullshit."

187
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:40,867
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

188
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,995
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

189
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,096
You don't know that.

190
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,597
I know a lot more than you.

191
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,333
You're drunk, and you're mean.

192
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,176
And I'm right.

193
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,872
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

194
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:55,841
It doesn't fit Alice.

195
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,343
If she keeps it, she'll die.

196
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,778
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

197
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:02,280
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

198
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,991
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

199
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,722
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

200
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,725
Alice has it all. She'll never do it.

201
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,293
Well, fine. Go get some.

202
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,595
Oh, sure, I'll just pop over
to the store.

203
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:20,298
Actually, I think I may know someone

204
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:22,200
who may be of assistance.

205
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,202
But given their naked opportunism,

206
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,404
I can't imagine it'll come free.

207
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,622
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

208
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,208
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

209
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,585
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

210
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,981
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

211
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,716
We had the most wonderful adventure.

212
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,586
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

213
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:42,753
And it's always light.

214
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:44,555
A man urinated next to me.

215
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,058
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broad Way.

216
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,160
You call it "Cats," but it's
just humans in cat greasepaint.

217
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,063
And we tried a delicacy called pizza

218
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:57,301
at an eatery that was "Family Style."

219
00:08:57,311 --> 00:09:01,505
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

220
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,739
Hi, Todd.

221
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,174
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

222
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,977
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy anything at all?

223
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:10,680
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

224
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,516
I do want you to like things, you know.

225
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:17,487
I can tell you want to be a good father.

226
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:20,090
It's sort of sweet.

227
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,092
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

228
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,528
With time.

229
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,963
Let's go with that.

230
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,465
Not to interrupt this Hallmark moment,

231
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,542
but Todd, you got a sec?

232
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:34,445
Yeah.

233
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,674
Wait, fairies are real?

234
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:41,777
I thought Fray was just nuts.

235
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,612
I mean, she is, but yeah,

236
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,213
they're real and they're raging dicks,

237
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:47,149
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

238
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,953
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

239
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:52,600
Just make sure Fray doesn't see 'em,

240
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:55,124
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

241
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:57,567
I've got another job for you.

242
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:01,296
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

243
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,331
What's with the feathers?

244
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,034
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

245
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:07,802
- to the Fairy Queen.
- Mmm...

246
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:10,372
Okay. As long as she bought it.

247
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:11,873
Everyone in the castle did.

248
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,341
Even Prince Fomar
and the Stone Queen headed back

249
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:16,744
to their mountain/island.

250
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,147
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

251
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:22,650
Well, that's good news, right?

252
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,986
So what's with the face?

253
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:40,475
Well, this just took a dark turn.

254
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:47,640
In exchange for my babies,
you want... my bathtub?

255
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,942
You collect toes and eyeballs,

256
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,677
and you think that's weird?

257
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:54,281
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

258
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,816
curious act of extortion.

259
00:10:56,826 --> 00:11:00,854
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,455
on the side of the road.

261
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:05,525
We thought you'd be alarmed by that too,

262
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:09,295
given you forced us into that alliance.

263
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:12,031
So what's it gonna be? Your bathtub?

264
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,467
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

265
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:18,104
It's a strange deal.

266
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:19,423
Even for me.

267
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,592
Right.

268
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:23,609
I should be more specific.

269
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,044
You're giving your bathtub

270
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,546
to the entire population of Fillory.

271
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:30,215
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

272
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,650
It'll be fun.

273
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,854
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

274
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:39,157
everyone will then be able to see us.

275
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,826
I suppose you're right.

276
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:42,461
No more shadow-puppeting.

277
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,363
Just straight-up puppeting, from now on.

278
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,698
Or hey, you could leave.

279
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,135
There is another option, you know.

280
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:53,004
I find my children, and then...

281
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:54,505
You have till tomorrow.

282
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,641
So have fun on the little egg hunt,

283
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:58,143
'cause if you don't make this deal,

284
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,477
we're about to boil and dye 'em

285
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,746
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

286
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:04,690
I don't know what that means.

287
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,485
So, if I understand you correctly,

288
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:11,021
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

289
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:15,025
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

290
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,527
Because I need your help.

291
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,195
Well, why should I trust you now?

292
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,529
You've already lied to me once.

293
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,365
She's lied to me several times too.

294
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,500
So at least you know it's not personal.

295
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,901
Like it wasn't personal

296
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,371
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

297
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,706
without so much as texting me first.

298
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,376
Henry, trust me, better me than them.

299
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:33,710
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

300
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,515
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

301
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,917
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

302
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,619
Limited reserves.

303
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,955
I just need a little bit.

304
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,389
I gave what I had to a friend.

305
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,392
- Why the hell would you do that?
- But it is killing her.

306
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,736
So without your help, she will
die and so will the magic.

307
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,572
All right.

308
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,911
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

309
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,407
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

310
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,142
You knew about this?

311
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,476
I thought I was very clear

312
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,612
about not looking in the cubbyhole.

313
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,914
You were. That's why I looked.

314
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,281
Fray, what are those?

315
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,618
Fairy eggs. That Father and Margo took.

316
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,586
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

317
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,456
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

318
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,958
The Fairy Queen stole you from us.

319
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:26,561
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

320
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:31,166
It was a fair deal.
This... is kidnapping.

321
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:35,570
Unlike you, we have honor.

322
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,606
You're not a fairy, Fray.

323
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:42,143
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

324
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,412
as anything but a human?

325
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:45,914
Because she won't.

326
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,448
That's not true.

327
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,586
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

328
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,454
That's pretty cold.

329
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,956
Humans are complicated.

330
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,425
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

331
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,760
Yeah, like, I once donated a kidney

332
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,495
to this girl I really liked.

333
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,030
Only, it turned out she didn't actually

334
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,665
need it for a transplant.

335
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:08,977
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

336
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,314
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

337
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:18,653
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

338
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:22,323
Family is about loyalty, my love.

339
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,966
Fuck you!

340
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,498
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

341
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:40,300
<i>She slept with Josh.</i>

342
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,801
On our Fillorian spring break.

343
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,336
While he and I were still dating.

344
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,205
Are you really still upset about Josh?

345
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:48,007
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

346
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,174
Yeah, do you not get that

347
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,542
that only makes it more fucked up?

348
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:52,211
Sorry, could we just focus for a second?

349
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:53,813
It's just kind of important.

350
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:57,179
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

351
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,383
I still wouldn't help you.

352
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,019
'Cause I don't trust you.

353
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,762
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

354
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:10,662
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

355
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:13,098
I know. It's just not that simple, okay?

356
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,167
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

357
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:16,701
Group?

358
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,604
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

359
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,707
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

360
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:25,209
It's just... we got something going on.

361
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,178
Wait, is your boss, um...

362
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:32,017
is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

363
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:35,186
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriett person,

364
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:36,554
can... can you get her to help?

365
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:38,256
Uh, she doesn't exactly

366
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,890
- like me.
- Great.

367
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,427
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

368
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:45,129
So it makes perfect sense.

369
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:47,265
Some people are just so emotional.

370
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:50,901
Harriet does like Kady, though.

371
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:53,971
Okay, great, then let's talk to Kady.

372
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,405
Where is she?

373
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,950
Shit.

374
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,593
Kady.

375
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,981
All right, I can help you.

376
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,150
But you'll owe me a favor.

377
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,152
Uh, what's the favor?

378
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,229
To be determined.

379
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:23,324
- Trust her.
- What could go wrong?

380
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,592
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

381
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,160
It was buy the place

382
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,429
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

383
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,933
and turn this place into a...
an amusement park.

384
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:34,167
At least I care.

385
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,377
You care about something.

386
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,065
Do we have a deal?

387
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,298
Is that cocaine?

388
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,635
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

389
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,800
But yes, you will have to snort it.

390
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,605
I'm sorry, what creature?

391
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,907
I thought you had batteries.

392
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,641
Look, you asked me for my help.

393
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,718
This is what I have to offer.

394
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,480
Okay, Kady is in the High Risk Ward,

395
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,814
down the hallway over here.

396
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,183
The ward is locked. So is Kady's room.

397
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,019
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

398
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,854
Okay.

399
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,490
Those squiggles are guards?

400
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,190
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

401
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,792
Gotcha.

402
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,828
So, how are we gonna get in
past all the security?

403
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,664
We're not.
They are gonna bring her to us.

404
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,799
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

405
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,002
- for more than 15 days...
- They have to bring in

406
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,170
outside doctors to certify she's crazy.

407
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,473
Yeah, and, uh, we will be those doctors.

408
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:33,841
They'll buy that?

409
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:35,777
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

410
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,199
No, it's like a state hospital.

411
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,434
Yeah, their computer systems
are older than we are.

412
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:42,705
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

413
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,773
Good thinking.

414
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:46,375
Should I be concerned that you
both know so much about this?

415
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:50,253
Mm... There was a "crazy" time.

416
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:53,148
Okay, whatever, uh...

417
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:56,418
But it's not like you two can just
walk out of there with a patient.

418
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:59,088
No, but Kady can walk herself out

419
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:00,997
if she has a security badge.

420
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,627
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

421
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:07,436
No, I will.

422
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,175
Here we are.

423
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:23,677
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr....

424
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,013
Kline. Midtown Mental Health Clinic.

425
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,416
Which is where we work.

426
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:31,486
Yes. We're here to do an evaluation.

427
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:34,029
Great. Mind if I sit in?

428
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:40,035
No, not at all. Please do.

429
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:48,669
Okay, um, so, Kady, um...

430
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,873
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

431
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:58,011
from delusions, and that you've
been talking to someone

432
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:01,122
named, uh... Penny?

433
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,151
Oh, um, yeah.

434
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,853
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

435
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:08,188
We're breaking you out of here.

436
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,357
Kady, can you tell us about Penny?

437
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:14,635
Yeah, uh, yeah, he was a... my ex.

438
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,463
But I-I don't see him anymore.

439
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:19,331
Quentin's gonna hand you
a security badge.

440
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,900
It'll get you out of the ward.

441
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,635
When you're on break, in the day room,

442
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:25,646
use it to sneak out. We'll be waiting.

443
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:36,081
Oh, someone has lost their badge.

444
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,886
Great.

445
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:42,388
What now?

446
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,222
What if she doesn't take the deal?

447
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,991
Then what do we do? Or, no...

448
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,827
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

449
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,062
Stop it.

450
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,863
It's going to be fine.

451
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:52,826
We could cut our losses.

452
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:54,499
We could head back to Earth and regroup.

453
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,268
We could finish the quest,
restore magic,

454
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,004
and then maybe revisit this

455
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,672
when we stand a fighting chance.

456
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:04,709
You and I both sacrificed
a lot for Fillory.

457
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,212
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

458
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,355
to the albino supermodel?

459
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,283
Bitch took my eye.

460
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:15,286
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

461
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,796
But what if we're making things worse?

462
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:25,699
There wasn't a blood test to
tell me to be High Queen.

463
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,802
I chose it.

464
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:31,936
And I have had to fight for
every shred of authority.

465
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:33,604
And no offense,

466
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:37,274
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

467
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:40,777
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

468
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:44,114
Those fairy bitches wanna come
for my crown, well...

469
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:49,561
I'll shove it up their fucking eggholes.

470
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,158
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

471
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:57,093
I'm on board.

472
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:02,065
Maybe try the key.

473
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:03,209
- What?
- Well, I don't know.

474
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,567
Like, wave it around or something.

475
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,236
Maybe a keyhole will appear in the wall.

476
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,304
This is stupid.

477
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,973
And I feel sick.

478
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:12,475
Why are you here anyway?

479
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,443
We already stuck a fork in this, Penny.

480
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:16,812
- We're helping you.
- All of a sudden?

481
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:21,425
After I was such a ray
of sunshine to you last time.

482
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,187
We need you to talk to Harriet.

483
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:27,956
We need her help getting the next key,

484
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,699
so we can bring magic back.

485
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,796
All right. And where's the next key?

486
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,165
In the Underworld.

487
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:38,875
I'm the only one who can get it, Kady.

488
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,503
You're doing it again, aren't you?

489
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:44,747
Throwing your life
at a problem to solve it.

490
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:48,484
I'm tired, Penny.

491
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:53,315
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

492
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:56,017
I thought we weren't a couple.

493
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,885
That's not funny.

494
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:00,562
It's a little funny.

495
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,459
Hey, yell at me.

496
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:08,329
I don't want to. I am tired of yelling.

497
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:09,630
Yell at me.

498
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,633
I'm getting you out of this room.

499
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:13,867
Come on!

500
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:16,737
Aah!

501
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:18,747
Aah!

502
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:21,670
Aah!

503
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:28,415
Okay, Kady.

504
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,416
Hand over the contraband.

505
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:31,960
What's up?

506
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:38,252
Go, team.

507
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:54,039
Alice, what're you doing here?

508
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,708
What are you?

509
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,888
I thought you were in a psych ward.

510
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,111
I was.

511
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:00,613
Now I'm the sanest woman in America.

512
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:03,082
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

513
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,351
I actually can't really feel anything.

514
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:07,853
It's fantastic.

515
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,155
If I didn't know better, I would say

516
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:11,724
that you were just trying to cast

517
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:13,659
an intermediate unlocking charm.

518
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,661
That would mean that I have magic,

519
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,663
which we both know is impossible.

520
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,231
Right. Hmm.

521
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:22,167
Well, don't bother.
I already looted the place.

522
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:25,370
Brakebills may be closed.
Black market's not.

523
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,139
Gotta make a living.

524
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:29,841
You, uh, looking for something special?

525
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:33,579
Some Boswellia.

526
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:35,981
Bloodstone, steroids.

527
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:38,650
Fuck me.

528
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,085
So you do have magic.

529
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:42,186
What do you know about transplants?

530
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,755
I know you'd have to be desperate

531
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:46,032
to try something that stupid.

532
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:49,928
Well, who am I to judge?

533
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,338
I almost blew a werewolf
so he'd turn me.

534
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:54,432
Magical creatures...

535
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:57,876
they can hang on to their magic
just fine, so...

536
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,205
Please...

537
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:02,906
if you have anything that can help me...

538
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,576
Well, Boswellia and
Bloodstone are total bullshit.

539
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:09,046
But, uh, steroids might help a little.

540
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,517
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

541
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:16,353
It says take two. You should take eight.

542
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:18,722
- Thank you.
- We're all screwed anyway.

543
00:24:18,732 --> 00:24:20,999
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, hmm?

544
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:24,594
<i>- Dr. Bailey,</i>

545
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:26,596
<i>you're needed at nurse's station 204.</i>

546
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:29,974
<i>- Dr. Bailey...</i>
- Nurse coming. Shh!

547
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:38,749
I know you don't wanna talk right now.

548
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:42,245
- I sure don't.
- Yeah, yeah, hate me later.

549
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:45,222
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

550
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:48,250
You're the best thing in my life.

551
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,661
Short life, granted, but...

552
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:53,923
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

553
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,091
Well, you should.

554
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,927
It's crazy we lived this long.

555
00:24:57,937 --> 00:25:00,162
We met. We had great sex.

556
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:02,206
I got to know you.

557
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:05,133
I'm lucky.

558
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:06,768
What's your point?

559
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:09,771
Don't be mad too long.

560
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,173
I want you to be happy.

561
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:14,610
Jesus Christ.

562
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,845
I can't be.

563
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:19,622
Without you, you fucking idiot.

564
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:23,110
But isn't that just adult life?

565
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:26,454
Accepting your own misery.

566
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:28,423
<i>- Code Green,</i>

567
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:31,292
Shit. I guess they found my room.

568
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,793
Come on.

569
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,129
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

570
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,497
and the key locked up in there...

571
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,933
I know, I know. Quit being so twitchy.

572
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:40,201
You look suspicious.

573
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:42,136
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

574
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:45,607
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

575
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:47,709
<i>- Everyone stay in their room.</i>
- Oh, shit. Lockdown.

576
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,176
<i>And stay calm. We are on lockdown.</i>

577
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:51,511
We're gonna have to help her...

578
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:54,757
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

579
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:57,651
You sure this is gonna work?

580
00:25:57,661 --> 00:25:59,019
It's fire safety protocol.

581
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,189
How do you not know that?

582
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:07,193
<i>Attention, please proceed
to the nearest fire exit</i>

583
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:10,230
<i>and evacuate immediately.</i>
See? Works every time.

584
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,065
How many times have you done this?

585
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,467
<i>And evacuate immediately.</i>

586
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:16,002
Keep it moving!

587
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:21,141
I told you we'd figure it out.

588
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,653
Oh, shit.

589
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:40,334
Come on, let's go.

590
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,167
Well.

591
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,202
Alice is gone.

592
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:52,371
Might be time to use this.

593
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:55,048
To cast a locator spell.

594
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:01,379
Reminds me of the old days.

595
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:02,747
I don't wanna know.

596
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:12,757
This magic... it looks different.

597
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,392
It feels different.

598
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,895
If it's working, let's not split hairs.

599
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:20,632
Find her.

600
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:24,436
Wait a minute. What's Alice doing there?

601
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:28,080
I'm blind. Are you going to tell me?

602
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:32,301
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

603
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,245
She was upset and tried to take them.

604
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:36,814
I stopped her, but she ran away
and we can't find her.

605
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,216
This is not good.

606
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:40,752
And real bad timing, El.

607
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:46,657
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

608
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,656
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

609
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,187
we need to put a pin in it. There's
nothing we can do about it right now.

610
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:53,263
- Perhaps I can help.
- Oh, Fray.

611
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,932
We've been having quite a talk.

612
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:59,570
Eggs and portals and quests.

613
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,805
So much going on I didn't know about.

614
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,962
We really should discuss.

615
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,518
Crap.

616
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,137
Fray? How could you?

617
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:17,183
Like you said, family loyalty.

618
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:21,554
I've considered your offer.

619
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:26,217
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

620
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:28,352
I won't hurt yours.

621
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:30,622
Wait. What?

622
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:32,639
- No.
- Don't you touch her.

623
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,357
But my Queen...

624
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:38,546
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

625
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,898
- No one needs to get hurt.
- I agree.

626
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:45,430
I... I helped you. I...

627
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,004
Yes.

628
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:52,384
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

629
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:55,555
Betrayed your own parents.

630
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:58,648
Why would I ever trust you?

631
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:02,961
I just... found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

632
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:06,589
I just wanted all this to stop.

633
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,291
So let's stop this.

634
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:16,767
We gotta give her the eggs.

635
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:19,335
There's gotta be another way.
That's our only leverage.

636
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:22,605
I know, but she's my daughter.

637
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:24,640
We have a whole country to think about.

638
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,785
I can't be the dad that turns
his back on his kid.

639
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:30,946
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

640
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:35,292
- What're you saying?
- What?

641
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,637
Explain.

642
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:40,387
Now...

643
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:44,126
or it's poached eggs tonight.

644
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,637
Fray isn't yours.

645
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,469
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

646
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:57,926
She died?

647
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,597
Oh, gods, I...

648
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:05,675
Oh, no. Oh, no.

649
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,330
That is the sound
of your leverage dying.

650
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:19,417
You'd better shake on this deal
while you still can.

651
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:26,137
No, no way.

652
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:27,890
- Please.
- No.

653
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:29,793
I'm asking for this favor.

654
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:45,909
Okay, okay, look.

655
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,480
Look, I'm... I am grateful for
everything you did for me.

656
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,248
For Penny.

657
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,684
So how about this?

658
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:56,986
What if...

659
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:03,601
Then we both get what we want.

660
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,773
So we're gonna rob the Library?

661
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,975
- Oh, awesome.
- No, not awesome.

662
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:21,510
Stupid.

663
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,779
It is hard enough
to sneak one person in there.

664
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:25,815
How the hell are they gonna
get the whole group in?

665
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,283
It's the dumbest
fucking plan I've ever...

666
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:31,494
Uh, Penny's got some notes.

667
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:34,930
You said you wanted to do this.

668
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:37,233
You don't know
the defenses this place has.

669
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,136
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

670
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:42,346
Oh, are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

671
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,643
You've been waiting to say that.

672
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,768
I know what I'm doing.

673
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,805
My head's clear now.

674
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:52,940
You got me out. We'll get the key out.

675
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,943
You just... you have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

676
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:57,301
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

677
00:31:57,312 --> 00:31:59,546
Being on the astral plane's great.

678
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:01,856
Just a little over being stuck here.

679
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:06,953
Bringing magic back is
the only way I see out of this.

680
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:12,600
Wouldn't it be funny
if we made it out of this?

681
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:16,770
I'd laugh pretty hard.

682
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:20,934
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

683
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:24,403
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

684
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:27,173
Yeah, I heard that one before.

685
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:28,737
I love you.

686
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:32,586
I'm sorry we're cursed.

687
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:41,838
He's gone.

688
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:45,877
What, like, gone? Gone gone? Like...

689
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:49,261
Like, to the Library gone?

690
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:52,005
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

691
00:32:52,787 --> 00:32:55,555
So let's not fuck it up on our end.

692
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,810
Are you sure you wanna do this?

693
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,846
It's not exactly like everyone thinks...

694
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,781
Jonesing for blood.

695
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,816
Watching everyone you know die.

696
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:15,152
That is, if you
don't kill them yourself.

697
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,889
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

698
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,959
You seem... smart.
Too smart to want all this.

699
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,527
I don't want it.

700
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:26,397
- Then why...
- It's none of your business.

701
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:29,466
Well, then, no.

702
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:32,761
Becoming a creature...
no offense... is the only way

703
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:34,338
I can keep my magic.

704
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:35,949
Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

705
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,159
I'm not. But are you so sure

706
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,476
this'll do what you want it to?

707
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:41,144
No, but I'm out of options,

708
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,013
so will you take my money or not?

709
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:48,092
All right.

710
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,761
Alice, let's go.

711
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,164
Jesus, how did you find me?

712
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,866
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

713
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,002
All I found were shitty vampires.

714
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:07,537
Can we please go?

715
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,681
No, just leave. Continue.

716
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:15,745
Leave or I break it.

717
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:17,246
Ah! Get off me!

718
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,014
How did you do that?

719
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,050
Ah. Get out.

720
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,518
No, I gave you my money.

721
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:26,355
Not enough to deal with
hedgewitch Buffy. Good luck.

722
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,865
Out!

723
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,294
When we said we'd explore our options,

724
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,130
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

725
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,532
I researched. This is the only way.

726
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,734
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

727
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,047
Okay. I don't need your help,
you condescending bitch.

728
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,388
Aaaaaah!

729
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,454
Oh, no, Julia.

730
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:15,741
I transferred it all back.

731
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,137
I'm sorry.

732
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:23,708
All you did was try to help me,
and I almost killed you.

733
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:28,613
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

734
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:29,881
I guess we're even.

735
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:33,092
We're not,
but that's nice of you to say.

736
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:38,830
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

737
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,658
I mean, what do people in limbo do?

738
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,969
It's excruciating.

739
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:48,299
You know, and I just thought
maybe if I could just...

740
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:51,577
Fix it?

741
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,579
I know the feeling.

742
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:57,983
Really.

743
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:01,878
I still see Reynard.

744
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:03,283
You do?

745
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:08,026
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

746
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:11,187
Do you think maybe it's because...

747
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:14,532
I think it's because it happened.

748
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:19,203
And there's nothing magic
about it anymore.

749
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:23,032
When things happen, they leave a mark.

750
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:26,209
Figuring out how to deal
with it takes time.

751
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:32,074
I get what Quentin always saw in you.

752
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:34,051
You're brave.

753
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:36,112
Just stubborn.

754
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:39,081
I think that's why you can hold it.

755
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:42,217
All the pain, and all the shit
you didn't ask for,

756
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:44,853
that's what made you you.

757
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:47,856
And that's why this magic fits.

758
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:52,427
Maybe sometimes life is... random

759
00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:53,962
and unfair.

760
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:57,232
You know, it doesn't always
ask our permission.

761
00:36:57,242 --> 00:36:59,341
It just is.

762
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:02,979
Honestly...

763
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:07,583
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

764
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:13,222
Except that it's not his anymore, Julia.

765
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:18,186
I felt it. It... it's yours.

766
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:20,254
For whatever reason.

767
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,493
So what are you gonna do with it?

768
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,617
Fen.

769
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:43,695
Maybe you shouldn't be holding
sharp objects right now.

770
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:45,531
My father was a knife maker.

771
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,809
This is how I've always calmed down.

772
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,830
When our daughter was born,

773
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,632
they took her away.

774
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:10,778
They wouldn't let me hold her.
I never heard her cry.

775
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:14,540
I should have known.

776
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,675
How could I not know?

777
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,980
God, I was so ready to believe Fray.

778
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,650
I think deep down I thought...

779
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:32,124
If we just felt like a family,

780
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,694
if I just willed it hard enough,

781
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:37,328
then that would be real.

782
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:40,840
'Cause this...

783
00:38:41,743 --> 00:38:43,802
How am I supposed to live with it?

784
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:45,904
Oh, God.

785
00:38:45,914 --> 00:38:49,540
God, oh, Fen, I'm so sorry.

786
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,643
You would've been... um.

787
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:55,913
No, you were such a great mom.

788
00:38:56,508 --> 00:39:01,794
And... I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

789
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,051
You deserve so much better than this.

790
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,936
I'm gonna need some time.

791
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:13,764
I can't be in Fillory right now.

792
00:39:13,774 --> 00:39:16,233
Okay, okay.

793
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:37,607
Hey.

794
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:40,948
Okay, dude. Spill.

795
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:43,259
What's up?

796
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:47,226
What if... Penny doesn't find Benedict

797
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:50,800
or the Key? Or he gets caught
by a Librarian, or we do,

798
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,569
or any part
of this ridiculous plan fails?

799
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,039
It seems like you're worrying
about a lot of stuff

800
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:57,406
you can't control, here.

801
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:01,410
Everything that we're doing,
if we mess it up,

802
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,580
it's not just me who suffers.

803
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,782
It's not just us who suffers.

804
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,752
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

805
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:11,420
No, it's not the multiverse.

806
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,155
Magic doesn't exist in this universe.

807
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:15,157
It doesn't mean it's gone
in alternate realities.

808
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,335
- That is not the point.
- Oh, boy.

809
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,435
What're you doing?

810
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,204
Short-circuiting your panic attack.

811
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,349
It's getting tiresome.

812
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:29,911
Okay, I'm confused.

813
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:32,247
It's sweet how much you care
about your friends.

814
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,216
Even the ones that don't like you.

815
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,783
Let's just have some fun.

816
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:38,453
Seems like the chances of
everyone surviving

817
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:40,455
go up if we do that.

818
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:58,673
<i>Your eggs, I take it, are fine?</i>

819
00:40:58,683 --> 00:40:59,789
Yes.

820
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,031
What have you done with Fray?

821
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,354
She did not want to return with me.

822
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:05,954
Her fate is her own.

823
00:41:07,992 --> 00:41:09,516
Is the rest done?

824
00:41:09,526 --> 00:41:13,187
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

825
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:15,089
May they be clean forever.

826
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,959
I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift.

827
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:20,627
While we're at it.

828
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:23,129
What was your end game anyway?

829
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:27,501
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

830
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:30,937
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world

831
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,972
domination mega-villain" bullshit?

832
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,310
It's a sign of your human privilege

833
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,712
that you see things so simply.

834
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:42,782
Oh, but it is simple, Lady...
you made us look crazy.

835
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,684
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

836
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:47,520
But now everyone will understand

837
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,655
what was really happening to us.

838
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:52,992
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

839
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:55,194
Everyone can see you now.

840
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:58,697
True. And they can see you too.

841
00:41:58,707 --> 00:42:01,842
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

842
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:04,904
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

843
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:07,406
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

844
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:10,075
for some time.

845
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:12,010
I can no longer help you.

846
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,846
Help us with what?

847
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,751
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

848
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:22,821
a little too "Les Miz" for my liking.

849
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,057
- Okay, Bambi? They're armed.
- Ah!

850
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:29,226
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

851
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:33,197
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

852
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,733
Hold on! Hold on!

853
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:39,402
Aah! Aah!

854
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:42,647
I'm your Queen, you motherfuckers!
