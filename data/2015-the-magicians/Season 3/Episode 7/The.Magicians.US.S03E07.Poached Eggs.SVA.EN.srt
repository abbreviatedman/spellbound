00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,533
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,511
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:05,347
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,363
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,998
<i>I'll go to Fillory on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,134
That girl you saw in the
dungeon... we'll get her out.

7
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:12,812
Victoria.

8
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:13,890
You found me.

9
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:14,954
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:16,936
No, I have to put myself back together.

11
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:18,033
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:20,587
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:21,921
No.

14
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,623
The fairies aren't just terraforming,

15
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:25,285
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:26,850
We need a plan bigger than

17
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,357
just assassinating the Queen. We need...

18
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:30,196
Hostages, leverage. Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,299
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,533
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

21
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,538
They don't just make portals.
They are portals.

22
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:41,307
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:44,443
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

24
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,612
If I could give it to you, I would.

25
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:48,614
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

26
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,783
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,284
Ah... Alice!

28
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:55,387
Okay, someone's gotta hear this, please.

29
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:03,453
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,336
The little weirdo wouldn't go to sleep
until I read him a bedtime story.

31
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:08,800
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

32
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,702
Q's probably already at the tree.

33
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,170
Tick, how are we doing?

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,639
Five minutes till
the fairy guards change shifts,

35
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:15,974
Your Majesties.

36
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,211
Now, no one knows we're gone, okay?

37
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,814
If the Fairy Queen asks, we're
bedridden with something contagious.

38
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,148
Like chicken pox.

39
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:25,817
Certainly, Highness. But must you leave?

40
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:28,543
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat... difficult.

41
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:30,588
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

42
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,490
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

43
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,825
that this land is now theirs.

44
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:36,861
They've been, well, pillaging... a lot.

45
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,996
I-I thought perhaps a royal address...

46
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:40,497
You're thinking too small.

47
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,067
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

48
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:45,002
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

49
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:47,671
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

50
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:49,673
But we can't deal with the Floaters

51
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:53,618
until we deal with the Fairies, got it?

52
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:56,112
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

53
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,681
to send you to the Underworld.

54
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:58,849
That is so cool.

55
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,450
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

56
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,286
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

57
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:05,422
Ah, I hear she's kinda withholding.

58
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:06,777
And judge-y.

59
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:09,327
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able to help us?

60
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,175
There's no "us." I'm gonna
go talk to Penny alone,

61
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:13,737
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

62
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,512
you were willing to backstab me for.

63
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:18,916
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

64
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,250
Q!

65
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,951
Oh, good.

66
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:25,288
Hey, I don't know if it was just,
like, a super anxious rabbit,

67
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:27,506
but your message made
things seem kinda...

68
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:28,525
Dire? They are.

69
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,193
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

70
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,629
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Poppy.

71
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,197
I'm helping Quentin find the next key.

72
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:37,200
- No, she's not helping me. We're...
- Okay, can we hit pause on the recap

73
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,035
until we're back
where our pasty usurpers

74
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:41,037
won't kill us all?

75
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,739
<i>♪ I've got all my life to live ♪</i>

76
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,907
<i>♪ I've got all my love to give ♪</i>

77
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:48,711
<i>♪ And I'll survive I will survive ♪</i>

78
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,713
<i>♪ Hey hey ♪</i>

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,885
Oh, my God.

80
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:59,155
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

81
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:02,224
Alice, can you hear me?

82
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:11,562
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

83
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,903
I told you, I'm fine.

84
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:17,136
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

85
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:18,406
I expected this, okay?

86
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,676
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

87
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:23,779
There are occasional surges.

88
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,147
That's all this was.

89
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:27,448
I mean, was that all this was? A surge?

90
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,752
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

91
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:32,754
of organ transplant protection.

92
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,089
Attacking itself to get
rid of the invader.

93
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:38,092
Or maybe it's nothing at all. Who knows?

94
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,294
Who knows?

95
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:40,995
Well, we need a better answer than that.

96
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:44,165
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

97
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,934
I have no idea what's going to happen.

98
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:48,503
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

99
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,938
Energy-balancing spells, exercises...

100
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:52,639
I suppose that could work.

101
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,608
Your confidence is overwhelming.

102
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,310
What's the point of lying?

103
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,156
You people are just going to do
what you do, regardless...

104
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,992
Q.

105
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,124
Okay, you go get the key, I got this.

106
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,793
No, I'm gonna stay here and help.

107
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:17,163
I don't think more is merrier here.

108
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,633
I don't know... didn't you notice
your ex is a little...

109
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,135
Stubborn.

110
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,070
I noticed.

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,639
Alice and I got into this together.

112
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,541
I'll get us out, one way or another.

113
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:31,874
And I will make sure that she's okay.

114
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:32,912
Okay?

115
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:35,381
Go get the key while you still can.

116
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:38,159
We're all kinda counting on you
to bring back all of magic.

117
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,356
So you lost your key in the Underworld

118
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,325
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

119
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,994
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

120
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:52,498
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

121
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:53,932
I'm an astral projection.

122
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:57,502
No offense, but your corpse is ash,

123
00:04:57,512 --> 00:05:01,006
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

124
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,909
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

125
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,178
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

126
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:07,263
Yeah.

127
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,914
And I burned my body to avoid that.

128
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,049
Look, if we do not get to the Underworld

129
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:14,185
before Benedict moves on...
whatever that means...

130
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,788
then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

131
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:17,955
That's not my problem.

132
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,024
No magic is everyone's problem.

133
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,595
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

134
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,089
Especially to you?

135
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,140
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

136
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,534
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

137
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,869
is at stake.

138
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,713
Fine. I'll help.

139
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:37,875
But it's not like I can
just Travel to the Underworld.

140
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,543
So we need a gatekeeper.

141
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,113
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

142
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,648
What about the Library's dragon?

143
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,617
Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.

144
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,419
At least one side of the convo, anyway.

145
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,153
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:53,824
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

147
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:56,698
I read about it during dissertation
research. I assume it's real.

148
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,236
Ask your invisible friend.

149
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,231
Yeah, apparently.

150
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,666
I hear they use it to send

151
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,100
books to and from the Underworld.

152
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,501
'Cause dragons are portals, right?

153
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:08,738
Yeah, exact... ha...
the Bookwyrm's too small

154
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,773
to send a full-size person down there.

155
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:13,451
Well, what if the person was a book?

156
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:18,181
Well, you said you can project
into objects, right?

157
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:20,416
Yeah, I did... did say that, didn't I?

158
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:23,319
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

159
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:27,790
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

160
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,425
it's stuck in the Satellite Library,

161
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:31,160
which is on another planet, so...

162
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,297
So, we need another Traveler.

163
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,765
- Um.
- Oh.

164
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,133
I only know one.

165
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,202
And she got grabbed by
the Beast in Fillory.

166
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,137
Victoria, she was in my class.

167
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,839
Wait a minute, you know Victoria?

168
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,774
Of course you know her, you... um...

169
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,443
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

170
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:50,279
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

171
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,646
I have no idea where she is.

172
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:54,115
If she's on Earth, I can find her.

173
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,618
On one condition... I wanna come.

174
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:58,854
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

175
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:00,889
This could be my only shot.

176
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,858
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

177
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,868
This doesn't make us friends, you know.

178
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:12,533
Discover anything useful for Alice?

179
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:16,637
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

180
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:18,172
on combining immunosuppressants

181
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:20,808
with a crystal-based healing ritual.

182
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:25,246
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

183
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:28,348
Not long ago, you wanted magic so badly

184
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,250
you fought through a memory wipe.

185
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,593
And now...

186
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:34,154
It's complicated. Uh... and personal.

187
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,758
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled Millennial bullshit."

188
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,867
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

189
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,995
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

190
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:43,096
You don't know that.

191
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:44,597
I know a lot more than you.

192
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,333
You're drunk, and you're mean.

193
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,176
And I'm right.

194
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,872
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

195
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,841
It doesn't fit Alice.

196
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,343
If she keeps it, she'll die.

197
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:58,778
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

198
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,280
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

199
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,991
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

200
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,722
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

201
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:12,725
Alice has it all. She'll never do it.

202
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,293
Well, fine. Go get some.

203
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,595
Oh, sure, I'll just pop over
to the store.

204
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,298
Actually, I think I may know someone

205
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:21,200
who may be of assistance.

206
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,202
But given their naked opportunism,

207
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,404
I can't imagine it'll come free.

208
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:27,622
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

209
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,208
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

210
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,585
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

211
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,981
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

212
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,716
We had the most wonderful adventure.

213
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,586
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

214
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:41,753
And it's always light.

215
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,555
A man urinated next to me.

216
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,058
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broad Way.

217
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,160
You call it "Cats," but it's
just humans in cat greasepaint.

218
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,063
And we tried a delicacy called pizza

219
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,301
at an eatery that was "Family Style."

220
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:00,505
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

221
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:01,739
Hi, Todd.

222
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,174
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

223
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:05,977
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy anything at all?

224
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:09,680
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

225
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,516
I do want you to like things, you know.

226
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:16,487
I can tell you want to be a good father.

227
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:19,090
It's sort of sweet.

228
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,092
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

229
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,528
With time.

230
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,963
Let's go with that.

231
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,465
Not to interrupt this Hallmark moment,

232
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:30,542
but Todd, you got a sec?

233
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,445
Yeah.

234
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:37,674
Wait, fairies are real?

235
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:40,777
I thought Fray was just nuts.

236
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,612
I mean, she is, but yeah,

237
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:44,213
they're real and they're raging dicks,

238
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,149
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,953
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

240
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,600
Just make sure Fray doesn't see 'em,

241
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:54,124
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

242
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,567
I've got another job for you.

243
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,296
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

244
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,331
What's with the feathers?

245
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:05,034
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

246
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:06,802
- to the Fairy Queen.
- Mmm...

247
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,372
Okay. As long as she bought it.

248
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:10,873
Everyone in the castle did.

249
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:13,341
Even Prince Fomar
and the Stone Queen headed back

250
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,744
to their mountain/island.

251
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,147
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

252
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:21,650
Well, that's good news, right?

253
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,986
So what's with the face?

254
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,475
Well, this just took a dark turn.

255
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:44,640
In exchange for my babies,
you want... my bathtub?

256
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,942
You collect toes and eyeballs,

257
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,677
and you think that's weird?

258
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:51,281
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

259
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,816
curious act of extortion.

260
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:57,854
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

261
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,455
on the side of the road.

262
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:02,525
We thought you'd be alarmed by that too,

263
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:06,295
given you forced us into that alliance.

264
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:09,031
So what's it gonna be? Your bathtub?

265
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,467
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

266
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:15,104
It's a strange deal.

267
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:16,423
Even for me.

268
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:17,592
Right.

269
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:20,609
I should be more specific.

270
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,044
You're giving your bathtub

271
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:24,546
to the entire population of Fillory.

272
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:27,215
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

273
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,650
It'll be fun.

274
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,854
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

275
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,157
everyone will then be able to see us.

276
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,826
I suppose you're right.

277
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:39,461
No more shadow-puppeting.

278
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,363
Just straight-up puppeting, from now on.

279
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:44,698
Or hey, you could leave.

280
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,135
There is another option, you know.

281
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:50,004
I find my children, and then...

282
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:51,505
You have till tomorrow.

283
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:53,641
So have fun on the little egg hunt,

284
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,143
'cause if you don't make this deal,

285
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:56,477
we're about to boil and dye 'em

286
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,746
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

287
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:01,690
I don't know what that means.

288
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,485
So, if I understand you correctly,

289
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:08,021
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

290
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:12,025
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

291
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,527
Because I need your help.

292
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:15,195
Well, why should I trust you now?

293
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,529
You've already lied to me once.

294
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,365
She's lied to me several times too.

295
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,500
So at least you know it's not personal.

296
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,901
Like it wasn't personal

297
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,371
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

298
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:26,706
without so much as texting me first.

299
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:29,376
Henry, trust me, better me than them.

300
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:30,710
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

301
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:35,515
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

302
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,917
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

303
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:39,619
Limited reserves.

304
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,955
I just need a little bit.

305
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:43,389
I gave what I had to a friend.

306
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,392
- Why the hell would you do that?
- But it is killing her.

307
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:49,736
So without your help, she will
die and so will the magic.

308
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,572
All right.

309
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:57,911
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

310
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:01,407
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

311
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,142
You knew about this?

312
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:04,476
I thought I was very clear

313
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,612
about not looking in the cubbyhole.

314
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,914
You were. That's why I looked.

315
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,281
Fray, what are those?

316
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,618
Fairy eggs. That Father and Margo took.

317
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,586
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

318
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:18,456
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

319
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,958
The Fairy Queen stole you from us.

320
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,561
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

321
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:28,166
It was a fair deal.
This... is kidnapping.

322
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:32,570
Unlike you, we have honor.

323
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,606
You're not a fairy, Fray.

324
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:39,143
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

325
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,412
as anything but a human?

326
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,914
Because she won't.

327
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,448
That's not true.

328
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,586
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

329
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,454
That's pretty cold.

330
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:51,956
Humans are complicated.

331
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,425
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

332
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,760
Yeah, like, I once donated a kidney

333
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,495
to this girl I really liked.

334
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,030
Only, it turned out she didn't actually

335
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,665
need it for a transplant.

336
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,977
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

337
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,314
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

338
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:15,653
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

339
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,323
Family is about loyalty, my love.

340
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,966
Fuck you!

341
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,498
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

342
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,300
<i>She slept with Josh.</i>

343
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,801
On our Fillorian spring break.

344
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,336
While he and I were still dating.

345
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,205
Are you really still upset about Josh?

346
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,007
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

347
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,174
Yeah, do you not get that

348
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,542
that only makes it more fucked up?

349
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,211
Sorry, could we just focus for a second?

350
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,813
It's just kind of important.

351
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,179
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

352
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,383
I still wouldn't help you.

353
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,019
'Cause I don't trust you.

354
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,762
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

355
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,662
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

356
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:10,098
I know. It's just not that simple, okay?

357
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,167
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

358
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,701
Group?

359
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:16,604
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

360
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:19,707
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

361
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:22,209
It's just... we got something going on.

362
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,178
Wait, is your boss, um...

363
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:29,017
is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

364
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:32,186
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriett person,

365
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:33,554
can... can you get her to help?

366
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,256
Uh, she doesn't exactly

367
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,890
- like me.
- Great.

368
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,427
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

369
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,129
So it makes perfect sense.

370
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,265
Some people are just so emotional.

371
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,901
Harriet does like Kady, though.

372
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:50,971
Okay, great, then let's talk to Kady.

373
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,405
Where is she?

374
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,950
Shit.

375
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,593
Kady.

376
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,481
All right, I can help you.

377
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:11,650
But you'll owe me a favor.

378
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,652
Uh, what's the favor?

379
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,729
To be determined.

380
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,824
- Trust her.
- What could go wrong?

381
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,092
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

382
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:22,660
It was buy the place

383
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,929
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

384
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,433
and turn this place into a...
an amusement park.

385
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:29,667
At least I care.

386
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:31,877
You care about something.

387
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:36,115
Do we have a deal?

388
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:44,348
Is that cocaine?

389
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:47,685
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

390
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,386
But yes, you will have to snort it.

391
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:50,855
I'm sorry, what creature?

392
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,957
I thought you had batteries.

393
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,691
Look, you asked me for my help.

394
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,768
This is what I have to offer.

395
00:16:57,804 --> 00:16:59,530
Okay, Kady is in the High Risk Ward,

396
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,864
down the hallway over here.

397
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:03,233
The ward is locked. So is Kady's room.

398
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:06,069
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

399
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,904
Okay.

400
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:09,540
Those squiggles are guards?

401
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

402
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,842
Gotcha.

403
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:14,878
So, how are we gonna get in
past all the security?

404
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:17,714
We're not.
They are gonna bring her to us.

405
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:19,849
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

406
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,052
- for more than 15 days...
- They have to bring in

407
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,220
outside doctors to certify she's crazy.

408
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,523
Yeah, and, uh, we will be those doctors.

409
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,891
They'll buy that?

410
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,827
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

411
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:32,249
No, it's like a state hospital.

412
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,484
Yeah, their computer systems
are older than we are.

413
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:37,755
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

414
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,823
Good thinking.

415
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,425
Should I be concerned that you
both know so much about this?

416
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,303
Mm... There was a "crazy" time.

417
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:48,198
Okay, whatever, uh...

418
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,468
But it's not like you two can just
walk out of there with a patient.

419
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,138
No, but Kady can walk herself out

420
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:56,047
if she has a security badge.

421
00:17:56,716 --> 00:18:00,677
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

422
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:02,486
No, I will.

423
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,225
Here we are.

424
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:18,727
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr....

425
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:21,063
Kline. Midtown Mental Health Clinic.

426
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,466
Which is where we work.

427
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:26,536
Yes. We're here to do an evaluation.

428
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:29,079
Great. Mind if I sit in?

429
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:35,085
No, not at all. Please do.

430
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:43,719
Okay, um, so, Kady, um...

431
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:47,923
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

432
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:53,061
from delusions, and that you've
been talking to someone

433
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:56,172
named, uh... Penny?

434
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,201
Oh, um, yeah.

435
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,903
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

436
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:03,238
We're breaking you out of here.

437
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:05,407
Kady, can you tell us about Penny?

438
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:09,685
Yeah, uh, yeah, he was a... my ex.

439
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,513
But I-I don't see him anymore.

440
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:14,381
Quentin's gonna hand you
a security badge.

441
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:15,950
It'll get you out of the ward.

442
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,685
When you're on break, in the day room,

443
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:20,696
use it to sneak out. We'll be waiting.

444
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:31,131
Oh, someone has lost their badge.

445
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,936
Great.

446
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:37,438
What now?

447
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:39,272
What if she doesn't take the deal?

448
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:41,041
Then what do we do? Or, no...

449
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:43,877
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

450
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,112
Stop it.

451
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:46,913
It's going to be fine.

452
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:47,876
We could cut our losses.

453
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,549
We could head back to Earth and regroup.

454
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,318
We could finish the quest,
restore magic,

455
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:54,054
and then maybe revisit this

456
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:55,722
when we stand a fighting chance.

457
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:59,759
You and I both sacrificed
a lot for Fillory.

458
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,262
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

459
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,405
to the albino supermodel?

460
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,333
Bitch took my eye.

461
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:10,336
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

462
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,846
But what if we're making things worse?

463
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:20,749
There wasn't a blood test to
tell me to be High Queen.

464
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,852
I chose it.

465
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:26,986
And I have had to fight for
every shred of authority.

466
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:28,654
And no offense,

467
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:32,324
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

468
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:35,827
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

469
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:39,164
Those fairy bitches wanna come
for my crown, well...

470
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:44,611
I'll shove it up their fucking eggholes.

471
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,208
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

472
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:52,143
I'm on board.

473
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,115
Maybe try the key.

474
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,259
- What?
- Well, I don't know.

475
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,617
Like, wave it around or something.

476
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,286
Maybe a keyhole will appear in the wall.

477
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,354
This is stupid.

478
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:06,023
And I feel sick.

479
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,525
Why are you here anyway?

480
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,493
We already stuck a fork in this, Penny.

481
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,862
- We're helping you.
- All of a sudden?

482
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:16,475
After I was such a ray
of sunshine to you last time.

483
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:20,237
We need you to talk to Harriet.

484
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,006
We need her help getting the next key,

485
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:24,749
so we can bring magic back.

486
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:28,846
All right. And where's the next key?

487
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:31,215
In the Underworld.

488
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,925
I'm the only one who can get it, Kady.

489
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,553
You're doing it again, aren't you?

490
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,797
Throwing your life
at a problem to solve it.

491
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,534
I'm tired, Penny.

492
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:48,365
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

493
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,067
I thought we weren't a couple.

494
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,935
That's not funny.

495
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,612
It's a little funny.

496
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,509
Hey, yell at me.

497
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,379
I don't want to. I am tired of yelling.

498
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,680
Yell at me.

499
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,683
I'm getting you out of this room.

500
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,917
Come on!

501
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,787
Aah!

502
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,797
Aah!

503
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:16,720
Aah!

504
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,465
Okay, Kady.

505
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,466
Hand over the contraband.

506
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:27,010
What's up?

507
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,302
Go, team.

508
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,976
Alice, what're you doing here?

509
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,645
What are you?

510
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,825
I thought you were in a psych ward.

511
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,048
I was.

512
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,550
Now I'm the sanest woman in America.

513
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,019
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

514
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:00,288
I actually can't really feel anything.

515
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:01,790
It's fantastic.

516
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,092
If I didn't know better, I would say

517
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:05,661
that you were just trying to cast

518
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,596
an intermediate unlocking charm.

519
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:09,598
That would mean that I have magic,

520
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:11,600
which we both know is impossible.

521
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,168
Right. Hmm.

522
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:16,104
Well, don't bother.
I already looted the place.

523
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:19,307
Brakebills may be closed.
Black market's not.

524
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:21,076
Gotta make a living.

525
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,778
You, uh, looking for something special?

526
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:27,516
Some Boswellia.

527
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:29,918
Bloodstone, steroids.

528
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:32,587
Fuck me.

529
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:34,022
So you do have magic.

530
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:36,123
What do you know about transplants?

531
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,692
I know you'd have to be desperate

532
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:39,969
to try something that stupid.

533
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:43,865
Well, who am I to judge?

534
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,275
I almost blew a werewolf
so he'd turn me.

535
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:48,369
Magical creatures...

536
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,813
they can hang on to their magic
just fine, so...

537
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:55,142
Please...

538
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:56,843
if you have anything that can help me...

539
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,513
Well, Boswellia and
Bloodstone are total bullshit.

540
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,983
But, uh, steroids might help a little.

541
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,454
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

542
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:10,290
It says take two. You should take eight.

543
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,659
- Thank you.
- We're all screwed anyway.

544
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:14,936
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, hmm?

545
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,531
<i>- Dr. Bailey,</i>

546
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,533
<i>you're needed at nurse's station 204.</i>

547
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,911
<i>- Dr. Bailey...</i>
- Nurse coming. Shh!

548
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,686
I know you don't wanna talk right now.

549
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:36,182
- I sure don't.
- Yeah, yeah, hate me later.

550
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:39,159
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

551
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,187
You're the best thing in my life.

552
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:44,598
Short life, granted, but...

553
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,860
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

554
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,028
Well, you should.

555
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,864
It's crazy we lived this long.

556
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:54,099
We met. We had great sex.

557
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:56,143
I got to know you.

558
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,070
I'm lucky.

559
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,705
What's your point?

560
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:03,708
Don't be mad too long.

561
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,110
I want you to be happy.

562
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,547
Jesus Christ.

563
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:10,782
I can't be.

564
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,559
Without you, you fucking idiot.

565
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,047
But isn't that just adult life?

566
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,391
Accepting your own misery.

567
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:22,360
<i>- Code Green,</i>

568
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,229
Shit. I guess they found my room.

569
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,730
Come on.

570
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,066
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

571
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:30,434
and the key locked up in there...

572
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,870
I know, I know. Quit being so twitchy.

573
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,138
You look suspicious.

574
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:36,073
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

575
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,544
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

576
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:41,646
<i>- Everyone stay in their room.</i>
- Oh, shit. Lockdown.

577
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:43,113
<i>And stay calm. We are on lockdown.</i>

578
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,448
We're gonna have to help her...

579
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,694
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

580
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,588
You sure this is gonna work?

581
00:25:51,598 --> 00:25:52,956
It's fire safety protocol.

582
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:56,126
How do you not know that?

583
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:01,130
<i>Attention, please proceed
to the nearest fire exit</i>

584
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,167
<i>and evacuate immediately.</i>
See? Works every time.

585
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:06,002
How many times have you done this?

586
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:07,404
<i>And evacuate immediately.</i>

587
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:09,939
Keep it moving!

588
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,078
I told you we'd figure it out.

589
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:19,590
Oh, shit.

590
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,271
Come on, let's go.

591
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,104
Well.

592
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,139
Alice is gone.

593
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,308
Might be time to use this.

594
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:48,985
To cast a locator spell.

595
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,316
Reminds me of the old days.

596
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,684
I don't wanna know.

597
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,694
This magic... it looks different.

598
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:08,329
It feels different.

599
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:11,832
If it's working, let's not split hairs.

600
00:27:11,842 --> 00:27:14,569
Find her.

601
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:18,373
Wait a minute. What's Alice doing there?

602
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:22,017
I'm blind. Are you going to tell me?

603
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,238
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

604
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:28,182
She was upset and tried to take them.

605
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:30,751
I stopped her, but she ran away
and we can't find her.

606
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,153
This is not good.

607
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:34,689
And real bad timing, El.

608
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:40,594
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

609
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:42,593
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

610
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:45,124
we need to put a pin in it. There's
nothing we can do about it right now.

611
00:27:45,135 --> 00:27:47,200
- Perhaps I can help.
- Oh, Fray.

612
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,869
We've been having quite a talk.

613
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,507
Eggs and portals and quests.

614
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:56,742
So much going on I didn't know about.

615
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:58,899
We really should discuss.

616
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:01,455
Crap.

617
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,374
Fray? How could you?

618
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:09,120
Like you said, family loyalty.

619
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,491
I've considered your offer.

620
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:18,154
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

621
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,289
I won't hurt yours.

622
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,559
Wait. What?

623
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,576
- No.
- Don't you touch her.

624
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:26,294
But my Queen...

625
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:30,533
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

626
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,635
- No one needs to get hurt.
- I agree.

627
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:37,167
I... I helped you. I...

628
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:38,741
Yes.

629
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:44,121
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

630
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:47,292
Betrayed your own parents.

631
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,385
Why would I ever trust you?

632
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,698
I just... found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

633
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:58,326
I just wanted all this to stop.

634
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,028
So let's stop this.

635
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,504
We gotta give her the eggs.

636
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:11,072
There's gotta be another way.
That's our only leverage.

637
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,342
I know, but she's my daughter.

638
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,377
We have a whole country to think about.

639
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,522
I can't be the dad that turns
his back on his kid.

640
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,683
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

641
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:27,029
- What're you saying?
- What?

642
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:29,374
Explain.

643
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,124
Now...

644
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:35,863
or it's poached eggs tonight.

645
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:42,374
Fray isn't yours.

646
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:46,206
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

647
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,663
She died?

648
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,334
Oh, gods, I...

649
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:57,412
Oh, no. Oh, no.

650
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:06,067
That is the sound
of your leverage dying.

651
00:30:07,303 --> 00:30:11,154
You'd better shake on this deal
while you still can.

652
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,874
No, no way.

653
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,627
- Please.
- No.

654
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:21,530
I'm asking for this favor.

655
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:37,646
Okay, okay, look.

656
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:42,217
Look, I'm... I am grateful for
everything you did for me.

657
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,985
For Penny.

658
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,421
So how about this?

659
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,723
What if...

660
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:55,338
Then we both get what we want.

661
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:09,510
So we're gonna rob the Library?

662
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,712
- Oh, awesome.
- No, not awesome.

663
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,247
Stupid.

664
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:15,516
It is hard enough
to sneak one person in there.

665
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:17,552
How the hell are they gonna
get the whole group in?

666
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:19,020
It's the dumbest plan I've ever...

667
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:23,231
Uh, Penny's got some notes.

668
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:26,667
You said you wanted to do this.

669
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,970
You don't know
the defenses this place has.

670
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,873
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

671
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:34,083
Oh, are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

672
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,380
You've been waiting to say that.

673
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,505
I know what I'm doing.

674
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:42,542
My head's clear now.

675
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,677
You got me out. We'll get the key out.

676
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:47,680
You just... you have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

677
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,038
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

678
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,283
Being on the astral plane's great.

679
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:53,593
Just a little over being stuck here.

680
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:58,690
Bringing magic back is
the only way I see out of this.

681
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:04,337
Wouldn't it be funny
if we made it out of this?

682
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,507
I'd laugh pretty hard.

683
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,671
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

684
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,140
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

685
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,910
Yeah, I heard that one before.

686
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,474
I love you.

687
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:24,323
I'm sorry we're cursed.

688
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,575
He's gone.

689
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:37,614
What, like, gone? Gone gone? Like...

690
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,998
Like, to the Library gone?

691
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,742
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

692
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:47,292
So let's not fuck it up on our end.

693
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,547
Are you sure you wanna do this?

694
00:32:57,557 --> 00:32:59,583
It's not exactly like everyone thinks...

695
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:01,518
Jonesing for blood.

696
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:03,553
Watching everyone you know die.

697
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:06,889
That is, if you
don't kill them yourself.

698
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,626
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

699
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:13,696
You seem... smart.
Too smart to want all this.

700
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:15,264
I don't want it.

701
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:18,134
- Then why...
- It's none of your business.

702
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:21,203
Well, then, no.

703
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:24,498
Becoming a creature...
no offense... is the only way

704
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,075
I can keep my magic.

705
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,686
Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

706
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:29,896
I'm not. But are you so sure

707
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,213
this'll do what you want it to?

708
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:32,881
No, but I'm out of options,

709
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,750
so will you take my money or not?

710
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,829
All right.

711
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:50,498
Alice, let's go.

712
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:52,901
Jesus, how did you find me?

713
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,603
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

714
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,739
All I found were shitty vampires.

715
00:33:57,749 --> 00:33:59,274
Can we please go?

716
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:02,418
No, just leave. Continue.

717
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,482
Leave or I break it.

718
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:08,983
Ah! Get off me!

719
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:10,751
How did you do that?

720
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,787
Ah. Get out.

721
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,255
No, I gave you my money.

722
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:18,092
Not enough to deal with
hedgewitch Buffy. Good luck.

723
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:19,602
Out!

724
00:34:21,772 --> 00:34:24,031
When we said we'd explore our options,

725
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,867
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

726
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:29,269
I researched. This is the only way.

727
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:31,471
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

728
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:35,784
Okay. I don't need your help,
you condescending bitch.

729
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:44,125
Aaaaaah!

730
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:51,191
Oh, no, Julia.

731
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,078
I transferred it all back.

732
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:09,474
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:13,045
All you did was try to help me,
and I almost killed you.

734
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:17,950
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

735
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,218
I guess we're even.

736
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:22,429
We're not,
but that's nice of you to say.

737
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:28,167
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

738
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:30,995
I mean, what do people in limbo do?

739
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:33,306
It's excruciating.

740
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:37,636
You know, and I just thought
maybe if I could just...

741
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:40,914
Fix it?

742
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,916
I know the feeling.

743
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:47,320
Really.

744
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:51,215
I still see Reynard.

745
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:52,620
You do?

746
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:57,363
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

747
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:00,524
Do you think maybe it's because...

748
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,869
I think it's because it happened.

749
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:08,540
And there's nothing magic
about it anymore.

750
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:12,369
When things happen, they leave a mark.

751
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,546
Figuring out how to deal
with it takes time.

752
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:21,411
I get what Quentin always saw in you.

753
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:23,388
You're brave.

754
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,449
Just stubborn.

755
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:28,418
I think that's why you can hold it.

756
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:31,554
All the pain, and all the shit
you didn't ask for,

757
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,190
that's what made you you.

758
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,193
And that's why this magic fits.

759
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:41,764
Maybe sometimes life is... random

760
00:36:41,774 --> 00:36:43,299
and unfair.

761
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,569
You know, it doesn't always
ask our permission.

762
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,678
It just is.

763
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:52,316
Honestly...

764
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,920
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

765
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,559
Except that it's not his anymore, Julia.

766
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,523
I felt it. It... it's yours.

767
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,591
For whatever reason.

768
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:14,830
So what are you gonna do with it?

769
00:37:26,817 --> 00:37:29,954
Fen.

770
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:33,032
Maybe you shouldn't be holding
sharp objects right now.

771
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,868
My father was a knife maker.

772
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,146
This is how I've always calmed down.

773
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,167
When our daughter was born,

774
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,969
they took her away.

775
00:37:56,684 --> 00:38:00,115
They wouldn't let me hold her.
I never heard her cry.

776
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,877
I should have known.

777
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:06,012
How could I not know?

778
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:11,317
God, I was so ready to believe Fray.

779
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,987
I think deep down I thought...

780
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:21,461
If we just felt like a family,

781
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:25,031
if I just willed it hard enough,

782
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,665
then that would be real.

783
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:30,177
'Cause this...

784
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,139
How am I supposed to live with it?

785
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:35,241
Oh, God.

786
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:38,877
God, oh, Fen, I'm so sorry.

787
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:40,980
You would've been... um.

788
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,250
No, you were such a great mom.

789
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:51,131
And... I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

790
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,388
You deserve so much better than this.

791
00:38:57,048 --> 00:39:00,273
I'm gonna need some time.

792
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:03,101
I can't be in Fillory right now.

793
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:05,570
Okay, okay.

794
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:26,944
Hey.

795
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:30,285
Okay, dude. Spill.

796
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:32,596
What's up?

797
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:36,563
What if... Penny doesn't find Benedict

798
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,137
or the Key? Or he gets caught
by a Librarian, or we do,

799
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,906
or any part
of this ridiculous plan fails?

800
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,376
It seems like you're worrying
about a lot of stuff

801
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:46,743
you can't control, here.

802
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:50,747
Everything that we're doing,
if we mess it up,

803
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:53,917
it's not just me who suffers.

804
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,119
It's not just us who suffers.

805
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:59,089
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

806
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,757
No, it's not the multiverse.

807
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,492
Magic doesn't exist in this universe.

808
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:04,494
It doesn't mean it's gone
in alternate realities.

809
00:40:04,504 --> 00:40:07,672
- That is not the point.
- Oh, boy.

810
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,772
What're you doing?

811
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,541
Short-circuiting your panic attack.

812
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:14,686
It's getting tiresome.

813
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,248
Okay, I'm confused.

814
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:21,584
It's sweet how much you care
about your friends.

815
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:23,553
Even the ones that don't like you.

816
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:25,120
Let's just have some fun.

817
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,790
Seems like the chances of
everyone surviving

818
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,792
go up if we do that.

819
00:40:46,118 --> 00:40:48,010
<i>Your eggs, I take it, are fine?</i>

820
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,126
Yes.

821
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,368
What have you done with Fray?

822
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:52,691
She did not want to return with me.

823
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,291
Her fate is her own.

824
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,853
Is the rest done?

825
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:02,524
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

826
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,426
May they be clean forever.

827
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:08,296
I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift.

828
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:09,964
While we're at it.

829
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:12,466
What was your end game anyway?

830
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:16,838
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

831
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:20,274
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world

832
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:22,309
domination mega-villain" bullshit?

833
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:26,647
It's a sign of your human privilege

834
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:29,049
that you see things so simply.

835
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:32,119
Oh, but it is simple, Lady...
you made us look crazy.

836
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:35,021
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

837
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:36,857
But now everyone will understand

838
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,992
what was really happening to us.

839
00:41:39,002 --> 00:41:42,329
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

840
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:44,531
Everyone can see you now.

841
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:48,034
True. And they can see you too.

842
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:51,179
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

843
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:54,241
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

844
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:56,743
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

845
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:59,412
for some time.

846
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:01,347
I can no longer help you.

847
00:42:01,357 --> 00:42:04,183
Help us with what?

848
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:09,088
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

849
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:12,158
a little too "Les Miz" for my liking.

850
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:14,394
- Okay, Bambi? They're armed.
- Ah!

851
00:42:16,238 --> 00:42:18,563
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

852
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:22,534
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

853
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,070
Hold on! Hold on!

854
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,739
Aah! Aah!

855
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:31,984
I'm your Queen, you motherfuckers!
