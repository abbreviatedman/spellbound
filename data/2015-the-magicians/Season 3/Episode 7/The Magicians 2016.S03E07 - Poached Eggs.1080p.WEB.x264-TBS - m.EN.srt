Poppy Kline.
Dragonologist.

Post-graduate fellow

00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,301
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:15,919
<i>I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,245
That girl you saw in the dungeon...
we'll get her out.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,534
Victoria.

8
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:20,690
You found me.

9
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:21,823
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,940
No, I have to put myself
back together.

11
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:24,959
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,359
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,657
No.

14
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,821
The fairies aren't just
terraforming,

15
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,148
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,657
We need a plan bigger than

17
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,160
just assassinating the Queen.
We need...

18
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,901
Hostages, leverage.
Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,054
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:42,100
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

21
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,229
They don't just make portals.
They are portals.

22
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,917
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,134
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

24
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:53,341
If I could give it to you,
I would.

25
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,251
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:57,563

Alice.

Tick, how are we doing?

36
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,245
Five minutes till
the fairy guards change shifts,

Your Majesties.

we're gone, okay?

41
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,503
Certainly, Highness.
But must you leave?

42
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:35,531
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat... difficult.

43
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,268
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

44
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:39,018
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

45
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:40,542
that this land is now theirs.

46
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:43,420
They've been, well,
pillaging... a lot.

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,655
I-I thought perhaps
a royal address...

48
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,257
You're thinking too small.

49
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,851
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

50
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,690
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

51
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:54,425
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

52
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,284
But we can't deal with
the Floaters

53
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:59,550
until we deal with
the Fairies, got it?

54
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,839
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

55
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,198
to send you to the Underworld.

56
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,534
That is so cool.

57
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,205
Yeah, well,
it was a one-off.

58
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:10,057
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

59
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,097
Ah, I hear she's kinda
withholding.

60
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,347
And judge-y.

61
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,904
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able to help us?

62
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,065
There's no "us.

63
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,979

go talk to Penny alone,

00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,495
you were willing to
backstab me for.

66
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,714

some hostility here,

00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,002
- Q!
- And...

Oh, good.

like, a super anxious rabbit,

70

but your message made
things seem kinda...

71
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,435
Dire? They are.

00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,378
I expected this,
okay?

92
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:28,228
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

93
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,837
There are occasional
surges.

94

I mean,
was that all this was? A surge?

96
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:37,542
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

97
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,368
of organ transplant protection.

98
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:42,337
Attacking itself
to get rid of the invader.

99
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:44,923
Or maybe it's nothing at all. Who knows?

100
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,080
Who knows?

101
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,011
Well, we need a better answer
than that.

102
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,118
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

103
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,368
I have no idea what's going to happen.

104
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,269
Look, I prepared for this,
okay?

105
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:57,806
Energy-balancing spells,
exercises...

106
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:59,306
I suppose that could work.

107
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,345
Your confidence is
overwhelming.

108
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,038
What's the point of lying?

109
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:08,009
You people are just going to do
what you do, regardless...

110
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:10,587
Q.

111
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:18,222
Okay, you go get the key,
I got this.

112
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,743
No, I'm gonna stay here
and help.

113
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:23,579
I don't think
more is merrier here.

114
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,511
I don't know... didn't you notice
your ex is a little...

115
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:27,884
Stubborn.

116
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,478
I noticed.

117
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:33,212
Alice and I got into this together.

118
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:35,239
I'll get us out, one way or another.

119
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:38,329
And I will make sure that
she's okay.

120
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,651
Okay?

121
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,931
Go get the key while you still can.

122
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:45,048
We're all kinda counting on you
to bring back all of magic.

123
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,267
So you lost your key
in the Underworld

124
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:53,324
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

125
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,798
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

126
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:59,256
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

127
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:00,718
I'm an astral projection.

128
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,462
No offense,
but your corpse is ash,

129
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,790
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

130
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,647
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

131
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,056
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

132
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,199
Yeah.

133
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,837
And I burned my body
to avoid that.

134
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:17,927
Look, if we do not get to
the Underworld

135
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:21,149
before Benedict moves on...
whatever that means...

136
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,821
then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

137
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,964
That's not my problem.

138
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,017
No magic is everyone's
problem.

139
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,321
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

140
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,665
Especially to you?

141
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,790
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

142
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,421
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

143
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:37,985
is at stake.

144
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:40,017
Fine.

145
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,021
I'll help.

146
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,837
But it's not like I can
just Travel to the Underworld.

147
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,241
So we need a gatekeeper.

148
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:49,001
A dragon,
like Jules and I used.

149
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,196
What about the Library's
dragon?

150
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,313
Sorry, couldn't help
but overhear.

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,173
At least one side of the convo,
anyway.

152
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:57,031
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,517
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

154
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,438
I read about it during dissertation
research. I assume it's real.

155
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:04,978
Ask your invisible friend.

156
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:07,970
Yeah, apparently.

157
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:09,532
I hear they use it to send

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,970
books to and from
the Underworld.

159
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,581
'Cause dragons are portals,
right?

160
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,579
Yeah, exact... ha...
the Bookwyrm's too small

161
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,470
to send a full-size person
down there.

162
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,360
Well, what if the person
was a book?

163
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,022
Well, you said you can project
into objects, right?

164
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:27,524
Yeah, I did...
did say that, didn't I?

165
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:30,134
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

166
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,704
Except, say, I get the key

167
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,423
and send it back up...

168
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,256
it's stuck
in the Satellite Library,

169
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:38,103
which is on another planet,
so...

170
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:42,048
So, we need
another Traveler.

171
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:43,470
- Um.
- Oh.

172
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,829
I only know one.

173
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,969
And she got grabbed by
the Beast in Fillory.

174
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,165
Victoria, she was in my class.

175
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,717
Wait a minute, you know Victoria?

176
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,652
Of course you know her, you... um...

177
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,321
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

178
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:57,196
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

179
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:58,438
I have no idea where she is.

180
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:00,485
If she's on Earth, I can find her.

181
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:03,321
On one condition...
I wanna come.

182
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,784
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

183
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,305
This could be my only shot.

184
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:09,538
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

185
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,600
This doesn't make us friends,
you know.

186
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,350
Discover anything
useful for Alice?

187
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:23,428
Um, yeah, actually,
there's some pretty interesting stuff

188
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:25,110
on combining
immunosuppressants

189
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,249
with a crystal-based
healing ritual.

190
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:31,819
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

191
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:35,280
Not long ago,
you wanted magic so badly

192
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:37,069
you fought through a memory wipe.

193
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,435
And now...

194
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,995
It's complicated. Uh...
and personal.

195
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:44,358
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled Millennial bullshit."

196
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,422
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

197
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,874
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

198
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,079
You don't know that.

199
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,610
I know a lot more than you.

200
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,038
You're drunk, and you're mean.

201
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,475
And I'm right.

202
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,663
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

203
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,256
It doesn't fit Alice.

204
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,158
If she keeps it, she'll die.

205
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,538
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

206
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,158
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

207
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:10,663
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

208
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,600
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

209
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:19,311
Alice has it all. She'll never do it.

210
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,163
Well, fine. Go get some.

211
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,602
Oh, sure, I'll just pop over
to the store.

212
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,176
Actually, I think
I may know someone

213
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,772
who may be of assistance.

214
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:30,053
But given their naked opportunism,

215
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,139
I can't imagine it'll come free.

216
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,428
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

217
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:36,095
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

218
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,264
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

219
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:42,319
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

220
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,523
We had the most wonderful adventure.

221
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:47,372
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

222
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:48,640
And it's always light.

223
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,556
A man urinated next to
me.

224
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:53,063
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broad Way.

225
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:56,116
You call it "Cats," but it's
just humans in cat greasepaint.

226
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,941
And we tried a delicacy
called pizza

227
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:03,142
at an eatery that was
"Family Style."

228
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:07,249
Well, I am so glad that
you two had some bonding time.

229
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,553
Hi, Todd.

230
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:09,928
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

231
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,776
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy anything at all?

232
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:16,170
Earth?
Or the Square of Time?

233
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:19,354
I do want you to like things,
you know.

234
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:23,061
I can tell
you want to be a good father.

235
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,288
It's sort of sweet.

236
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:28,569
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

237
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,960
- With time.
- Oh.

238
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,030
Let's go with that.

239
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,915
Not to interrupt this
Hallmark moment,

240
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,670
but Todd, you got a sec?

241
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,056
Yeah.

242
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,350
Wait, fairies are real?

243
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:47,618
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought Fray was just nuts.

244
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,445
I mean, she is, but yeah,

245
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,092
they're real and they're raging dicks,

246
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,028
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

247
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:56,827
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

248
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,479
Just make sure
Fray doesn't see 'em,

249
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,624
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

250
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:03,156
I've got another job
for you.

251
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:07,260
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

252
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,914
What's with the feathers?

253
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:11,997
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

254
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,680
- to the Fairy Queen.
- Mmm...

255
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:16,652
Okay. As long as she bought it.

256
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,022
Everyone in the castle did.

257
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,219
Even Prince Fomar
and the Stone Queen headed back

258
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:22,806
to their mountain/island.

259
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,025
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

260
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:27,862
Well, that's good news, right?

261
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,357
So what's with the face?

262
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:33,647
♪♪

263
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:37,316
♪♪

264
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,706
♪♪

265
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,716
Well, this just took a dark turn.

266
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,393
In exchange for my babies,
you want... my bathtub?

267
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,367
You collect toes and eyeballs,

268
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:57,523
and you think that's weird?

269
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,883
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

270
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,997
curious act of extortion.

271
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:07,565
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

272
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,194
on the side of the road.

273
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:11,959
We thought
you'd be alarmed by that too,

274
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:15,509
given you forced us into that alliance.

275
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:18,934
So what's it gonna be? Your bathtub?

276
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:22,231
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

277
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,519
It's a strange deal.

278
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,186
Even for me.

279
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:27,404
Right.

280
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:29,763
I should be more specific.

281
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,849
You're giving your bathtub

282
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,305
to the entire
population of Fillory.

283
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,977
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

284
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:38,430
It'll be fun.

285
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:42,554
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

286
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,566
everyone will then be able
to see us.

287
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,474
I suppose you're right.

288
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,137
No more shadow-
puppeting.

289
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:51,857
Just straight-up puppeting, from now on.

290
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:54,416
Or hey,
you could leave.

291
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,720
There is another option,
you know.

292
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,000
I find my children, and then...

293
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:01,386
You have till tomorrow.

294
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,437
So have fun on the little
egg hunt,

295
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,930
'cause if you don't make
this deal,

296
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,307
we're about to boil and
dye 'em

297
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,638
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

298
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,014
I don't know what
that means.

299
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,295
So, if I understand you correctly,

300
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:18,030
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

301
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:21,668
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

302
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,374
Because I need your help.

303
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,064
Well, why should I trust
you now?

304
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,431
You've already lied to me
once.

305
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:28,048
She's lied to me
several times too.

306
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:30,174
So at least you know
it's not personal.

307
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,790
Like it wasn't personal

308
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,347
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

309
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,566
without so much as
texting me first.

310
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:39,190
Henry, trust me,
better me than them.

311
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,244
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

312
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,081
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

313
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:47,590
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

314
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:49,246
Limited reserves.

315
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,388
I just need a little bit.

316
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,106
I gave what I had
to a friend.

317
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:55,814
- Why the hell would you do that?
- But it is killing her.

318
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,283
So without your help,
she will die and so will the magic.

319
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:02,088
All right.

320
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:07,880
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

321
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,186
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

322
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,608
You knew about this?

323
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,399
I thought I was very clear

324
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,303
about not looking in the
cubbyhole.

325
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,877
You were.
That's why I looked.

326
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,716
Fray,
what are those?

327
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,988
Fairy eggs.
That Father and Margo took.

328
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,932
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

329
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,259
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

330
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,861
The Fairy Queen stole you
from us.

331
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,122
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

332
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,491
It was a fair deal.
This... is kidnapping.

333
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:41,416
Unlike you,
we have honor.

334
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:44,196
You're not a fairy, Fray.

335
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:49,010
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

336
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,719
as anything but a human?

337
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,610
Because she won't.

338
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:53,770
That's not true.

339
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:57,806
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

340
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,077
That's pretty cold.

341
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,786
Humans are complicated.

342
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:04,292
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

343
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,877
Yeah, like,
I once donated a kidney

344
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,325
to this girl I really liked.

345
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:09,907
Only, it turned out
she didn't actually

346
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,369

was your best friend.

<i>She slept with Josh.</i>

354
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,832
On our Fillorian spring break.

355
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,117
While he and I were
still dating.

356
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:52,023
Are you really still upset
about Josh?

357
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,973
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

358
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,110
Yeah, do you not get that

359
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,509
that only makes it more
fucked up?

360
00:14:57,576 --> 00:14:59,088
Sorry, could we just focus
for a second?

361
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,333
It's just kind of important.

362
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,754
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

363
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:05,358
I still wouldn't help you.

364
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,709
'Cause I don't trust you.

365
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:09,730
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

366
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,212
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

367
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:20,263
I know. It's just not that simple, okay?

368
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:22,044
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

369

Group?

370
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,444
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

371
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,574
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

Okay, so, if you know

378

- like me.
- Great.

379
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,970
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

380
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,959
So it makes perfect sense.

381
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,132

emotional.

Okay.

00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:41,535
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world

881
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:43,915
domination
mega-villain" bullshit?

882
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:47,761
It's a sign of your human privilege

883
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:50,199
that you see things so simply.

884
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:53,348
Oh, but it is simple, Lady...
you made us look crazy.

885
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:56,420
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

886
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,051
But now everyone will understand

887
00:41:58,231 --> 00:41:59,994
what was really happening to us.

888
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,077
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

889
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:05,556
Everyone can see you now.

890
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:09,308
True.
And they can see you too.

891
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,105
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

892
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:15,296
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

893
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:17,951
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

894
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,817
for some time.

895
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,177
I can no longer help you.

896
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,489
Help us with what?

897
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,547
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

898
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:32,823
a little too "Les Miz" for my liking.

899
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:36,112
- Okay, Bambi? They're armed.
- Ah!

900
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,712
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

901
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:43,104
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

902
00:42:44,171 --> 00:42:45,464
Ohh...

903
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:47,264
Hold on! Hold on!

904
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:49,397
Aah! Aah!

905
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:53,225
I'm your Queen,
you motherfuckers!
