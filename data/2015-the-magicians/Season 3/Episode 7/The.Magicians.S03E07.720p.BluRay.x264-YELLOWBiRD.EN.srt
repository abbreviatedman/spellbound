00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,704
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,751
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,579
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,414
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,111
<i>I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,175
That girl you saw in the
dungeon, we'll get her out.

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,423
Victoria.

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,630
You found me.

9
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,839
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,410
No, I have to put myself
back together.

11
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,845
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,178
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,512
No.

14
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,222
The fairies aren't
just terraforming,

15
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,148
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,521
<i>We need a plan bigger than</i>

17
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,193
just assassinating the Queen.
We need...

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,839
Hostages, leverage.
Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,898
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,153
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

21
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,155
<i>They don't just make portals.
They are portals.</i>

22
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,911
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,038
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

24
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,211
If I could give it to you,
I would.

25
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,209
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

26
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,382
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,879
God! Alice!

28
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,886
Okay, someone's gotta
hear this, please.

29
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,269
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,792
The little weirdo
wouldn't go to sleep

31
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,182
until I read him
a bedtime story.

32
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,393
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

33
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,318
Q's probably already
at the tree.

34
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,771
Tick, how are we doing?

35
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,231
Five minutes till the fairy guards
change shifts,

36
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,566
Your Majesties.

37
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,824
Now, no one knows
we're gone, okay?

38
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,074
If the Fairy Queen asks,

39
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,406
we're bedridden
with something contagious.

40
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,741
Like chicken pox.

41
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,417
Certainly, Highness.
But must you leave?

42
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,041
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat difficult.

43
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,214
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

44
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,087
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

45
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,417
that this land is now theirs.

46
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,470
They've been, well,
pillaging a lot.

47
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,593
I thought perhaps
a royal address...

48
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,094
You're thinking too small.

49
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,676
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,602
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

51
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,272
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

52
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,270
But we can't deal
with the Floaters

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,148
until we deal
with the Fairies, got it?

54
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,739
I can't believe you
paid the Hudson River dragon

55
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,282
to send you to the Underworld.

56
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,449
That is so cool.

57
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,072
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

58
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,906
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

59
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,036
I hear she's kinda withholding.

60
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,537
And judge-y.

61
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,105
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able

62
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,166
- to help us?
- There's no "us."

63
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,963
I'm gonna go talk
to Penny alone,

64
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,527
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

65
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,292
you were willing
to backstab me for.

66
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,720
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

67
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,047
Q!

68
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,757
Oh, good.

69
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,094
Hey, I don't know if it was just, like,
a super anxious rabbit,

70
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,020
but your message made
things seem kinda...

71
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,313
Dire? They are.

72
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,981
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

73
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,401
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Poppy.

74
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,008
I'm helping Quentin
find the next key.

75
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,688
No, she's not helping me.
We're...

76
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,051
Okay, can we hit pause
on the recap

77
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,816
until we're back
where our pasty usurpers

78
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,822
won't kill us all?

79
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,528
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

80
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,705
<i>I've got all my love to give.</i>

81
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,501
<i>And I'll survive I will survive.</i>

82
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,498
<i>Hey hey.</i>

83
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,666
Oh, my God.

84
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,969
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

85
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,887
Alice, can you hear me?

86
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,693
I told you, I'm fine.

87
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,757
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

88
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,192
I expected this, okay?

89
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,990
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

90
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,569
There are occasional surges.

91
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,949
That's all this was.

92
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,247
I mean, was that all
this was? A surge?

93
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,542
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

94
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,540
of organ transplant projection.

95
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,714
Attacking itself to get
rid of the invader.

96
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,882
Or maybe it's nothing at all.
Who knows?

97
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:39,969
Who knows?

98
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,794
Well, we need
a better answer than that.

99
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,972
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

100
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,725
I have no idea
what's going to happen.

101
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,302
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

102
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,729
Energy-balancing spells,
exercises...

103
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,431
I suppose that could work.

104
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,391
Your confidence is overwhelming.

105
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,109
What's the point of lying?

106
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,906
You people are just going to
do what you do, regardless...

107
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,408
Q.

108
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,916
Okay, you go get the key,
I got this.

109
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,580
No, I'm gonna
stay here and help.

110
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,539
I don't think
more is merrier here.

111
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,416
I don't know...
Didn't you notice your ex is a little...

112
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,085
Stubborn.

113
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,299
I noticed.

114
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,089
Alice and I
got into this together.

115
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,258
I'll get us out,
one way or another.

116
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,349
And I will make sure
that she's okay.

117
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,937
Okay?

118
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,731
Go get the key
while you still can.

119
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,516
We're all kinda counting on you

120
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,776
to bring back all of magic.

121
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,232
Yeah.

122
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,152
So you lost your key in the Underworld

123
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,280
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

124
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,787
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

125
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,287
For the millionth time,
dumb-ass, I'm not dead.

126
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,742
I'm an astral projection.

127
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,295
No offense,
but your corpse is ash,

128
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,791
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

129
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,719
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

130
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,967
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

131
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,173
Yeah.

132
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,723
And I burned my body
to avoid that.

133
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,847
Look, if we do not get
to the Underworld

134
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,975
before Benedict moves on...
Whatever that means...

135
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,599
Then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

136
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,773
That's not my problem.

137
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,817
No magic is everyone's problem.

138
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,401
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

139
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,982
Especially to you?

140
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,762
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

141
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,324
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

142
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,995
is at stake.

143
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,583
Fine. I'll help.

144
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,666
But it's not like I can
just travel to the Underworld.

145
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,337
So we need a gatekeeper.

146
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,915
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

147
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,463
What about the Library's dragon?

148
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,420
Sorry, couldn't help but
overhear.

149
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,221
At least one side
of the convo, anyway.

150
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,969
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mmm-hmm.

151
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,348
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

152
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,207
I read about it during
dissertation research.

153
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,099
I assume it's real.
Ask your invisible friend.

154
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,021
Yeah, apparently.

155
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,478
I hear they use it to send

156
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,904
books to and from
the Underworld.

157
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,322
'Cause dragons are portals,
right?

158
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,526
Yeah, except...
The Bookwyrm's too small

159
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,576
to send a full-size person
down there.

160
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,326
Well, what if
the person was a book?

161
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,994
Well, you said you can
project into objects, right?

162
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,204
Yeah, I did...
Did say that, didn't I?

163
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,132
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

164
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,336
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

165
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,220
It's stuck in
the Satellite Library,

166
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,969
which is on another planet,
so...

167
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,972
So, we need another Traveler.

168
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,934
Oh, I only know one.

169
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,186
And she got grabbed by
The Beast in Fillory.

170
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,809
Victoria, she was in my class.

171
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,644
Wait a minute,
you know Victoria?

172
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,570
Of course you know her, you...

173
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,238
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

174
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,068
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

175
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,447
I have no idea where she is.

176
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,369
If she's on Earth,
I can find her.

177
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,206
On one condition. I wanna come.

178
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,659
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

179
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,119
This could be my only shot.

180
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,708
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,627
This doesn't make us friends,
you know.

182
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,340
Discover anything useful for Alice?

183
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,434
Um, yeah, actually, there's some
pretty interesting stuff

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,182
on combining immunosuppressants

185
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,605
with a crystal-based
healing ritual.

186
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,939
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

187
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,151
Not long ago,
you wanted magic so badly

188
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,072
you fought through
a memory wipe.

189
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,159
And now...

190
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,153
It's complicated and personal.

191
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,580
Fine, I'll file it under "entitled
millennial bullshit."

192
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,499
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

193
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,855
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

194
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,915
You don't know that.

195
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,416
I know a lot more than you.

196
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,123
You're drunk, and you're mean.

197
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,549
And I'm right.

198
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,676
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

199
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,222
It doesn't fit Alice.

200
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,136
If she keeps it, she'll die.

201
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,594
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

202
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,187
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

203
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,481
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

204
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,529
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

205
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,532
Alice has it all.
She'll never do it.

206
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,109
Well, fine. Go get some.

207
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,407
Oh, sure, I'll just
pop over to the store.

208
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,114
Actually, I think
I may know someone

209
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,995
who may be of assistance.

210
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,997
But given
their naked opportunism,

211
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,204
I can't imagine it'll come free.

212
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,275
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

213
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,006
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

214
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,460
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

215
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,555
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

216
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,803
We had the most wonderful
adventure.

217
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,385
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

218
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,560
And it's always light.

219
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,639
A man urinated next to me.

220
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,271
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broadway.

221
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,148
You call it <i>Cats,</i> but
it's just humans in cat greasepaint.

222
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,863
And we tried a delicacy
called pizza

223
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,284
at an eatery that was
"Family Style."

224
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,330
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

225
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,532
Hi, Todd.

226
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,991
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

227
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,793
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy
anything at all?

228
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,297
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

229
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,338
I do want you
to like things, you know.

230
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,172
I can tell you want
to be a good father.

231
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,215
It's sort of sweet.

232
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,598
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

233
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,891
- With time.
- Oh!

234
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,897
Let's go with that.

235
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,021
Not to interrupt
this Hallmark moment,

236
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,148
but Todd, you got a sec?

237
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,320
Yeah.

238
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,484
Wait, fairies are real?

239
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,578
- Mmm-hmm.
- I thought Fray was just nuts.

240
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,405
I mean, she is, but, yeah,

241
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,036
they're real
and they're raging dicks,

242
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,812
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

243
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,750
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

244
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,234
Just make sure
Fray doesn't see 'em,

245
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,921
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

246
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,219
I've got another job for you.

247
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,098
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

248
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,974
What's with the feathers?

249
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,852
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

250
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,146
to the Fairy Queen.

251
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,433
Okay. As long as she bought it.

252
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,938
Everyone in the castle did.

253
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,145
Even Prince Fomar and
the Stone Queen headed back

254
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,902
to their mountain/island.

255
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,948
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

256
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,736
Well, that's good news, right?

257
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,121
So what's with the face?

258
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,220
Well, this
just took a dark turn.

259
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,557
In exchange for my babies,
you want my bathtub?

260
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,394
You collect toes and eyeballs,
and you think that's weird?

261
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,981
You'll pardon me, but I'm a bit
taken aback by this sudden

262
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,778
curious act of extortion.

263
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,566
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

264
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,821
on the side of the road.

265
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,532
We thought you'd be alarmed by that too,

266
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,119
given you forced us
into that alliance.

267
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,123
So what's it gonna be?
Your bathtub?

268
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,956
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

269
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,340
It's a strange deal.

270
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,219
- Even for me.
- Right.

271
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,630
I should be more specific.

272
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,757
You're giving your bathtub

273
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,264
to the entire population
of Fillory.

274
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,807
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

275
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,355
It'll be fun.

276
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,275
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

277
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,612
everyone will then
be able to see us.

278
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,530
I suppose you're right.

279
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,153
No more shadow-puppeting.

280
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,077
Just straight-up puppeting,
from now on.

281
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,405
Or hey, you could leave.

282
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,330
There is another option, you know.

283
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,706
I find my children, and then...

284
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,206
You have till tomorrow.

285
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,330
So have fun
on the little egg hunt,

286
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,835
'cause if you don't
make this deal,

287
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,167
we're about to boil and dye 'em

288
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,718
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

289
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,880
I don't know what that means.

290
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,178
So, if I understand you
correctly,

291
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,057
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

292
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,731
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

293
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,233
Because I need your help.

294
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,901
Well, why should I
trust you now?

295
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,228
You've already lied to me once.

296
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,063
She's lied to me
several times too.

297
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,198
So at least you know
it's not personal.

298
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,609
Like it wasn't personal

299
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,069
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

300
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,405
without so much
as texting me first.

301
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,082
Henry, trust me,
better me than them.

302
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,000
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

303
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,834
And don't think the rest of the board
wasn't considering it.

304
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,632
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

305
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,459
Limited reserves.

306
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,257
I just need a little bit.

307
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,096
I gave what I had to a friend.

308
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,326
Why the hell would you do that?

309
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,091
But it is killing her.

310
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,098
So without your help,
she will die and so will the magic.

311
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,972
All right.

312
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,695
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

313
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,107
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

314
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,691
You knew about this?

315
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,196
I thought I was very clear

316
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,324
about not looking
in the cubbyhole.

317
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,827
You were. That's why I looked.

318
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,077
Fray, what are those?

319
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,001
Fairy eggs. That Father
and Margo took.

320
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,481
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

321
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,169
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

322
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,672
The Fairy Queen
stole you from us.

323
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,253
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

324
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,887
It was a fair deal.
This is kidnapping.

325
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,311
Unlike you, we have honor.

326
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,097
You're not a fairy, Fray.

327
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,852
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

328
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,733
as anything but human?

329
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,610
Because she won't.

330
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,032
That's not true.

331
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,778
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

332
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,159
That's pretty cold.

333
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,660
Humans are complicated.

334
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,118
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

335
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,453
Yeah, like, I once
donated a kidney

336
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,209
to this girl I really liked.

337
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,383
Only, it turned out she didn't
actually need it for a transplant.

338
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,679
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

339
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,092
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

340
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,185
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

341
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,768
Family is about loyalty,
my love.

342
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,118
Fuck you!

343
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,204
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

344
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,001
She slept with Josh.

345
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,499
On our Fillorian spring break.

346
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,046
While he and I
were still dating.

347
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,919
Are you really still upset
about Josh?

348
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,093
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

349
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,588
Yeah, do you not get that that
only makes it more fucked up?

350
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,992
Sorry, could we just focus
for a second?

351
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,507
It's just kind of important.

352
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,685
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

353
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,103
I still wouldn't help you.

354
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,725
'Cause I don't trust you.

355
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,274
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

356
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,358
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

357
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,818
I know. It's just
not that simple, okay?

358
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,869
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

359
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,117
Group?

360
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,332
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

361
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,412
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

362
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,918
It's just...
we got something going on.

363
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,873
Wait, is your boss...

364
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:31,258
Is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

365
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,890
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriet person,

366
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,262
can you get her to help?

367
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,972
She doesn't exactly

368
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,598
- like me.
- Great.

369
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,894
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

370
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,854
So it makes perfect sense.

371
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,981
Some people are just
so emotional.

372
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,610
Harriet does like Kady, though.

373
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,233
Okay, great, then
let's talk to Kady.

374
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,819
Where is she?

375
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,122
Shit.

376
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,964
Kady.

377
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,056
All right, I can help you.
But you'll owe me a favor.

378
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,595
What's the favor?

379
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,268
To be determined.

380
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,476
Trust her. What could go wrong?

381
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,770
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

382
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,317
It was buy the place

383
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,607
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

384
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,111
and turn this place into a...
An amusement park.

385
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,317
At least I care.

386
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,614
You care about something.

387
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,664
Do we have a deal?

388
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,043
Is that cocaine?

389
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,376
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

390
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,086
But, yes, you will
have to snort it.

391
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,546
I'm sorry, what creature?

392
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,256
I thought you had batteries.

393
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,387
Look, you asked me for my help.

394
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,139
This is what I have to offer.

395
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,225
Okay, Kady is
in the High-Risk Ward,

396
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,556
down the hallway over here.

397
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,017
The ward is locked.
So is Kady's room.

398
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,769
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

399
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,070
Okay.

400
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,234
Those squiggles are guards?

401
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,362
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

402
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,533
Gotcha.

403
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,580
So, how are we gonna get in
past all the security?

404
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,407
We're not. They
are gonna bring her to us.

405
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,537
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

406
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,744
- for more than 15 days...
- They have to bring in

407
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,045
outside doctors
to certify she's crazy.

408
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,208
Yeah, and we will be
those doctors.

409
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,337
They'll buy that?

410
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,155
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

411
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,636
No, it's like a state hospital.

412
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,759
Yeah, their computer systems
are older than we are.

413
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,013
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

414
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,103
Good thinking.

415
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,394
Should I be concerned

416
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,832
that you both know
so much about this?

417
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,313
Mmm...

418
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,395
There was a "crazy" time.

419
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,485
Okay, whatever, uh...

420
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,508
But it's not like you two
can just walk out of there

421
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,739
with a patient.

422
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,408
No, but Kady
can walk herself out

423
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,360
if she has a security badge.

424
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,949
And what, she's supposed to steal
one of those off a guard?

425
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,283
No, I will.

426
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,543
Here we are.

427
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,183
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr...

428
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,348
Kline. Midtown
Mental Health Clinic.

429
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,471
Which is where we work.

430
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,808
Yes. We're here to do
an evaluation.

431
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,977
Great. Mind if I sit in?

432
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,407
No, not at all. Please do.

433
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:47,245
Okay, um, so, Kady,

434
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,204
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

435
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:57,339
from delusions, and that you've
been talking to someone

436
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,136
named Penny?

437
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,468
Oh, um, yeah.

438
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,888
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

439
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,511
We're breaking you out of here.

440
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,767
Kady, can you tell us
about Penny?

441
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:14,021
Yeah, yeah, he was a... My ex.

442
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,774
But I don't see him anymore.

443
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,651
Quentin's gonna hand you
a security badge.

444
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,232
It'll get you out of the ward.

445
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,158
When you're on break,
in the day room,

446
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,702
use it to sneak out.
We'll be waiting.

447
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,705
Oh. Someone
has lost their badge.

448
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,210
Great.

449
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,545
What now?

450
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,843
What if she doesn't
take the deal?

451
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,720
Then what do we do? Or, no...

452
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,143
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

453
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,390
Stop it.

454
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,187
It's going to be fine.

455
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,434
We could cut our losses.

456
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,877
We could head
back to Earth and regroup.

457
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,609
We could finish the quest,
restore magic,

458
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,312
and then maybe revisit this

459
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,147
when we stand a fighting chance.

460
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,822
You and I both sacrificed
a lot for Fillory.

461
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,577
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

462
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,454
to the albino supermodel?

463
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,624
Bitch took my eye.

464
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,124
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

465
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,872
But what if
we're making things worse?

466
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,512
There wasn't a blood test
to tell me to be High Queen.

467
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,840
I chose it.

468
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,262
And I have had to fight for
every shred of authority.

469
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,937
And no offense,

470
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,107
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

471
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,812
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

472
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,440
Those fairy bitches wanna
come for my crown, well...

473
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,453
I'll shove it up
their fucking eggholes.

474
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,916
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

475
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,953
I'm on board.

476
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,211
Maybe try the key.

477
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,676
- What?
- Well, I don't know.

478
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,947
Like, wave it around or
something.

479
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,553
Maybe a keyhole
will appear in the wall.

480
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,846
This is stupid.

481
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,137
And I feel sick.

482
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,930
Why are you here anyway?

483
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,766
We already stuck
a fork in this, Penny.

484
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,727
- We're helping you.
- All of a sudden?

485
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,440
After I was such a ray
of sunshine to you last time.

486
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,313
We need you to talk to Harriet.

487
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,280
We need her help
getting the next key,

488
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,735
so we can bring magic back.

489
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,664
All right.
And where's the next key?

490
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,495
In the Underworld.

491
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,999
I'm the only one
who can get it, Kady.

492
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,838
You're doing it again,
aren't you?

493
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,884
Throwing your life
at a problem to solve it.

494
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,470
I'm tired, Penny.

495
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,058
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

496
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,553
I thought we weren't a couple.

497
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,097
That's not funny.

498
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,565
It's a little funny.

499
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,775
Hey, yell at me.

500
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,657
I don't want to.
I am tired of yelling.

501
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,950
Yell at me.

502
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,902
I'm getting you
out of this room.

503
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,200
Come on!

504
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,048
Okay, Kady.

505
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,179
Hand over the contraband.

506
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,340
What's up?

507
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,562
Go, team.

508
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,779
Alice, what're you doing here?

509
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,280
What are you?

510
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,578
I thought you were
in a psych ward.

511
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:58,871
I was.

512
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,623
Now I'm the sanest woman
in America.

513
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,750
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

514
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,132
I actually
can't really feel anything.

515
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,629
It's fantastic.

516
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,920
If I didn't know better,
I would say

517
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,505
that you were
just trying to cast

518
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,431
an intermediate unlocking charm.

519
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,429
That would mean
that I have magic,

520
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,431
which we both know is
impossible.

521
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,012
Right.

522
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,019
Well, don't bother.
I already looted the place.

523
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,935
Brakebills may be closed.
Black market's not.

524
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,569
Gotta make a living.

525
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,821
You looking for something
special?

526
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,317
Some Boswellia.

527
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,195
Bloodstone, steroids.

528
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,739
Fuck me.

529
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,866
So you do have magic.

530
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,952
What do you know about
transplants?

531
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,537
I know you'd have to be
desperate

532
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,543
to try something that stupid.

533
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,209
Well, who am I to judge?

534
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,840
I almost blew a werewolf
so he'd turn me.

535
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,214
Magical creatures...

536
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,800
They can hang on to
their magic just fine, so...

537
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,770
Please...

538
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,625
If you have anything
that can help me...

539
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,358
Well, Boswellia and Bloodstone
are total bullshit.

540
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,562
But steroids
might help a little.

541
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,487
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

542
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,990
It says take two.
You should take eight.

543
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,492
- Thank you.
- We're all screwed anyway.

544
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,073
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

545
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,375
<i>Dr. Bailey,
you're needed at nurse's station 204.</i>

546
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,502
<i>- Dr. Bailey...</i>
- Nurse coming.

547
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,387
I know you don't
wanna talk right now.

548
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,019
- I sure don't.
- Yeah, yeah, hate me later.

549
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,726
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

550
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,772
You're the best thing
in my life.

551
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,270
Short life, granted, but...

552
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,699
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

553
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,865
Well, you should.

554
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,695
It's crazy we lived this long.

555
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,950
We met. We had great sex.

556
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,781
I got to know you.

557
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,534
I'm lucky.

558
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,540
What's your point?

559
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,667
Don't be mad too long.

560
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,965
I want you to be happy.

561
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,800
Jesus Christ.

562
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,007
I can't be.

563
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,057
Without you, you fucking idiot.

564
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,677
But isn't that just adult life?

565
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,014
Accepting your own misery.

566
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,020
<i>Code Green...</i>

567
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,068
Shit. I guess
they found my room.

568
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,566
Come on.

569
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,918
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

570
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,574
and the key
locked up in there...

571
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,697
I know, I know.
Quit being so twitchy.

572
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,994
You look suspicious.

573
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,912
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

574
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,374
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

575
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,498
<i>- Everyone stay in their room.</i>
- Shit. Lockdown.

576
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,954
<i>And stay calm.
We are on lockdown.</i>

577
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,539
We're gonna have to help her...

578
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,425
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

579
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,428
You sure this is gonna work?

580
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,800
It's fire safety protocol.

581
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
How do you not know that?

582
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,348
<i>Attention, please proceed</i>

583
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,975
<i>to the nearest fire exit</i>

584
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,025
<i>- and evacuate immediately.</i>
- See? Works every time.

585
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,851
How many times
have you done this?

586
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,231
<i>And evacuate immediately.</i>

587
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,439
Keep it moving!

588
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,988
I told you we'd figure it out.

589
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,206
- Shit.
- Damn it.

590
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,510
Whoa!

591
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,379
Come on, let's go.

592
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,849
Well.

593
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,480
Alice is gone.

594
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,649
Might be time to use this.

595
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,189
To cast a locator spell.

596
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,110
Ugh.

597
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,567
Reminds me of the old days.

598
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,406
I don't wanna know.

599
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,545
This magic...
It looks different.

600
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,167
It feels different.

601
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,672
If it's working,
let's not split hairs.

602
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,172
Find her.

603
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,224
Wait a minute.
What's Alice doing there?

604
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,639
I'm blind. Are you
going to tell me?

605
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,432
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

606
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,392
She was upset
and tried to take them.

607
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,606
I stopped her,
but she ran away and we can't find her.

608
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,983
This is not good.

609
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,531
And real bad timing, El.

610
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:46,454
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

611
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,017
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

612
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,407
we need to put a pin in it.

613
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,979
There's nothing we
can do about it right now.

614
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,960
- Perhaps I can help.
- Fray.

615
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,292
We've been having quite a talk.

616
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,042
Eggs and portals and quests.

617
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,383
So much going on
I didn't know about.

618
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,677
We really should discuss.

619
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,134
Crap.

620
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:16,477
- Fray? How could you?
- Like you said, family loyalty.

621
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,147
I've considered your offer.

622
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:26,111
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

623
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,158
I won't hurt yours.

624
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,540
Wait. What?

625
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,618
- No.
- Don't you touch her.

626
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,918
But my Queen...

627
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:38,499
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

628
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,459
- No one needs to get hurt.
- I agree.

629
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,762
I... I helped you. I...

630
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,798
Yes.

631
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,352
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

632
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,106
Betrayed your own parents.

633
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,351
Why would I ever trust you?

634
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,731
I just found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

635
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,029
I just wanted all this to stop.

636
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,986
So let's stop this.

637
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,035
We gotta give her the eggs.

638
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,043
There's gotta be another way.
That's our only leverage.

639
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,004
I know, but she's my daughter.

640
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,343
We have a whole country
to think about.

641
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,217
I can't be the dad that turns
his back on his kid.

642
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,637
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

643
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,642
- What're you saying?
- What?

644
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,023
Explain.

645
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,984
Now...

646
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,150
Or it's poached eggs tonight.

647
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,028
Fray isn't yours.

648
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,165
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

649
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,125
She died?

650
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,795
Oh, gods, I...

651
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,967
Oh, no. Oh, no.

652
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,601
That is the sound
of your leverage dying.

653
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,973
You'd better shake
on this deal while you still can.

654
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,734
No, no way.

655
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,857
- Please.
- No.

656
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,533
I'm asking for this favor.

657
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,378
Okay, okay, look.

658
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,838
Look, I'm... I am grateful for
everything you did for me.

659
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,969
For Penny.

660
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,720
So how about this?

661
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,472
What if...

662
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,442
Then we both get what we want.

663
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,494
So we're gonna rob the Library?

664
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,951
- Oh, awesome.
- No, not awesome.

665
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,502
Stupid.

666
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,750
It is hard enough
to sneak one person in there.

667
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
How the hell are they gonna
get the whole group in?

668
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,524
It's the dumbest fucking plan
I've ever...

669
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,178
Penny's got some notes.

670
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,469
You said you wanted to do this.

671
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,142
You don't know the defenses
this place has.

672
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,686
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

673
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,644
Are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

674
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,189
You've been waiting to say that.

675
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,941
I know what I'm doing.

676
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,148
My head's clear now.

677
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,863
You got me out.
We'll get the key out.

678
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,737
You just... You have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

679
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,117
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

680
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,823
Being on the Astral Plane's
great.

681
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,621
Just a little over
being stuck here.

682
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,000
Bringing magic back is
the only way I see out of this.

683
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,252
Wouldn't it be funny
if we made it out of this?

684
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,349
I'd laugh pretty hard.

685
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,853
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

686
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,307
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

687
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,142
Yeah, I heard that one before.

688
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,402
I love you.

689
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,235
I'm sorry we're cursed.

690
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,241
He's gone.

691
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,666
What, like, gone?
Gone-gone? Like...

692
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,247
Like, to the Library gone?

693
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,672
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

694
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,674
So let's not fuck it up
on our end.

695
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,731
Are you sure you wanna do this?

696
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,774
It's not exactly
like everyone thinks...

697
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,443
Jonesing for blood.

698
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,736
Watching everyone you know die.

699
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,107
That is, if you
don't kill them yourself.

700
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,823
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

701
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:21,748
You seem smart.
Too smart to want all this.

702
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,324
I don't want it.

703
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,331
- Then why...
- It's none of your business.

704
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,289
Well, then, no.

705
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,466
Becoming a creature...
No offense... Is the only way

706
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,838
I can keep my magic.

707
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,781
Why are you trying
to talk me out of it?

708
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,389
I'm not. But are you so sure this'll
do what you want it to?

709
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,058
No, but I'm out of options,

710
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,885
so will you take my money
or not?

711
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,848
All right.

712
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,693
Alice, let's go.

713
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,074
Jesus, how did you find me?

714
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,781
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

715
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,741
All I found
were shitty vampires.

716
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,243
Can we please go?

717
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,664
No, just leave. Continue.

718
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,668
Leave or I break it.

719
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,173
Ah! Get off me!

720
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,471
How did you do that?

721
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,972
Get out.

722
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,425
No, I gave you my money.

723
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,121
Not enough to deal
with hedge witch Buffy.

724
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,181
Good luck.

725
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,688
Out!

726
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,234
When we said we'd explore
our options,

727
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,063
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

728
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,440
I researched.
This is the only way.

729
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,651
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

730
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,412
Okay. I don't need your help,
you condescending bitch.

731
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,294
No, Julia.

732
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,398
I transferred it all back.

733
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,982
I'm sorry.

734
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,319
All you did was try to help me,
and I almost killed you.

735
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,907
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

736
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,750
I guess we're even.

737
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,670
We're not, but that's nice
of you to say.

738
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,542
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

739
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,508
I mean, what do people
in limbo do?

740
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,180
It's excruciating.

741
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,139
You know, and I just thought
maybe if I could just...

742
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,390
Fix it?

743
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,895
I know the feeling.

744
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,569
Really.

745
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,440
I still see Reynard.

746
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,743
You do?

747
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:07,162
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

748
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,041
Do you think maybe it's
because...

749
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,329
I think it's because
it happened.

750
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,587
And there's nothing magic
about it anymore.

751
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,302
When things happen,
they leave a mark.

752
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,339
Figuring out how to deal
with it takes time.

753
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,723
I get what Quentin
always saw in you.

754
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,184
You're brave.

755
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:35,984
Just stubborn.

756
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,652
I think that's why
you can hold it.

757
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,072
All the pain, and all the shit
you didn't ask for,

758
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,774
that's what made you you.

759
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,743
And that's why this magic fits.

760
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,284
Maybe sometimes life is random

761
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,834
and unfair.

762
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,412
You know, it doesn't always
ask our permission.

763
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,539
It just is.

764
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,085
Honestly...

765
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,555
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

766
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,186
Except that it's not
his anymore, Julia.

767
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,558
I felt it. It... It's yours.

768
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,188
For whatever reason.

769
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,406
So what are you gonna
do with it?

770
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,788
Fen.

771
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,292
Maybe you shouldn't be holding
sharp objects right now.

772
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,718
My father was a knife maker.

773
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,670
This is how I've
always calmed down.

774
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,187
When our daughter was born,

775
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:05,655
they took her away.

776
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,160
They wouldn't let me hold her.
I never heard her cry.

777
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,622
I should have known.

778
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,333
How could I not know?

779
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,962
God, I was so ready
to believe Fray.

780
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,917
I think deep down I thought...

781
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:31,596
If we just felt like a family,

782
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,677
if I just willed it hard enough,

783
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,933
then that would be real.

784
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,308
'Cause this...

785
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,651
How am I supposed
to live with it?

786
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,438
Oh, God.

787
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,198
God, Fen, I'm so sorry.

788
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,027
You would've been...

789
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,118
No, you were such a great mom.

790
00:38:55,875 --> 00:39:01,416
And I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

791
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,499
You deserve so much
better than this.

792
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,044
I'm gonna need some time.

793
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,636
I can't be in Fillory right now.

794
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,388
Okay, okay.

795
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,365
Hey.

796
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,034
Okay, dude. Spill.

797
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,459
What's up?

798
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,544
What if...
Penny doesn't find Benedict

799
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,875
or the key?

800
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,677
Or he gets caught
by a Librarian, or we do,

801
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,426
or any part of this
ridiculous plan fails?

802
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,883
It seems like you're worrying
about a lot of stuff

803
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,263
you can't control, here.

804
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,267
Everything that we're doing,
if we mess it up,

805
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,441
it's not just me who suffers.

806
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,644
It's not just us who suffers.

807
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,606
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

808
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,281
No, it's not the multiverse.

809
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,029
Magic doesn't exist
in this universe.

810
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,039
It doesn't mean it's gone
in alternate realities.

811
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,659
- That is not the point.
- Oh, boy.

812
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,825
What're you doing?

813
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,581
Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

814
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,332
It's getting tiresome.

815
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,295
Okay, I'm confused.

816
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,627
It's sweet how much you care
about your friends.

817
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,337
Even the ones
that don't like you.

818
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,172
Let's just have some fun.

819
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,850
Seems like the chances of
everyone surviving

820
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,552
go up if we do that.

821
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,976
Hmm?

822
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,077
Your eggs, I take it, are fine?

823
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,164
Yes.

824
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,408
What have you done with Fray?

825
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,624
She did not
want to return with me.

826
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,001
Her fate is her own.

827
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,922
Is the rest done?

828
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,297
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

829
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,466
May they be clean forever.

830
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,844
I'm sure they'll
appreciate the gift.

831
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,016
While we're at it.

832
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,220
What was your end game anyway?

833
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,895
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

834
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,319
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world domination

835
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,362
"mega-villain" bullshit?

836
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,696
It's a sign
of your human privilege

837
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,119
that you see things so simply.

838
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,164
But it is simple, Lady...
You made us look crazy.

839
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,084
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

840
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,910
But now everyone will understand

841
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,871
what was really happening to us.

842
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,840
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

843
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,460
Everyone can see you now.

844
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,097
True. And they can see you too.

845
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,890
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

846
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,307
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

847
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,810
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

848
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,481
for some time.

849
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,401
I can no longer help you.

850
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,194
Help us with what?

851
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,156
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

852
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,328
a little too <i>Les Mis</i>
for my liking.

853
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,448
Okay, Bambi? They're armed.

854
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,243
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

855
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,872
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

856
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,126
Hold on! Hold on!

857
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,890
I'm your Queen,
you motherfuckers!
