00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,727
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,772
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,602
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,403
At your service.
You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,119
<i>I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,183
That girl you saw in the
dungeon, we'll get her out.

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,441
Victoria.

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,641
You found me.

9
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:15,876
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,393
No, I have to put
myself back together.

11
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,885
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,183
You are a danger to
yourself and to others.

13
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,518
No.

14
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,251
The fairies aren't
just terraforming,

15
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,156
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,524
<i>We need a plan bigger than</i>

17
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,187
just assassinating
the Queen. We need...

18
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,823
Hostages, leverage.
Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,924
Did you get the key?
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,162
I'm a terrible
failure. Benedict, no!

21
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,167
<i>They don't just make
portals. They are portals.</i>

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,936
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,070
It's magic. I'd do
anything to get it back.

24
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,205
If I could give it
to you, I would.

25
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

26
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,377
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,885
God! Alice!

28
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,889
Okay, someone's
gotta hear this, please.

29
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,295
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,808
The little weirdo
wouldn't go to sleep

31
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,198
until I read him
a bedtime story.

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,395
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

33
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,335
Q's probably
already at the tree.

34
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,805
Tick, how are we doing?

35
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,240
Five minutes till the
fairy guards change shifts,

36
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,572
Your Majesties.

37
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,841
Now, no one knows
we're gone, okay?

38
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,108
If the Fairy Queen asks,

39
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,412
we're bedridden with
something contagious.

40
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,781
Like chicken pox.

41
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,411
Certainly, Highness.
But must you leave?

42
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,046
Prince Fomar's people
have been somewhat difficult.

43
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,216
What do you mean?
It seems your union

44
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,123
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

45
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,422
that this land is now theirs.

46
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,487
They've been,
well, pillaging a lot.

47
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,590
I thought perhaps
a royal address...

48
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,134
You're thinking too small.

49
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,693
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,602
Extortion. Exactly!

51
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,267
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

52
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,277
But we can't deal
with the Floaters

53
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,143
until we deal with
the Fairies, got it?

54
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,793
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

55
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,285
to send you to the Underworld.

56
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,445
That is so cool.

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,078
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

58
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,919
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

59
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,051
I hear she's kinda withholding.

60
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,560
And judge-y.

61
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,105
Anyway, you think your
ghost friend's gonna be able

62
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,189
to help us? There's no "us."

63
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,994
I'm gonna go talk
to Penny alone,

64
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,510
and you're gonna go
back to whatever life

65
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,298
you were willing
to backstab me for.

66
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,738
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

67
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,069
Q!

68
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,769
Oh, good.

69
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,109
Hey, I don't know if it was
just, like, a super anxious rabbit,

70
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,045
but your message
made things seem kinda...

71
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,310
Dire? They are.

72
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,011
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

73
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,383
Who the fuck are you? I'm Poppy.

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,011
I'm helping Quentin
find the next key.

75
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,716
No, she's not
helping me. We're...

76
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,067
Okay, can we hit
pause on the recap

77
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,855
until we're back where
our pasty usurpers

78
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,827
won't kill us all?

79
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,557
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

80
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,724
<i>I've got all my love to give</i>

81
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,497
<i>And I'll survive I will survive</i>

82
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,504
<i>Hey hey</i>

83
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,671
Oh, my God.

84
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,975
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

85
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,879
Alice, can you hear me?

86
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,686
I told you, I'm fine.

87
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,740
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

88
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,232
I expected this, okay?

89
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,996
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

90
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,595
There are occasional surges.

91
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,969
That's all this was.

92
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,270
I mean, was that all
this was? A surge?

93
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,539
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

94
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,546
of organ transplant projection.

95
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,708
Attacking itself to
get rid of the invader.

96
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,880
Or maybe it's nothing
at all. Who knows?

97
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,976
Who knows?

98
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,817
Well, we need a
better answer than that.

99
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,949
You wanted to do the
spell. It's all an experiment.

100
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,727
I have no idea what's
going to happen.

101
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,319
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

102
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,729
Energy-balancing
spells, exercises...

103
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,460
I suppose that could work.

104
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,399
Your confidence is overwhelming.

105
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,128
What's the point of lying?

106
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:01,904
You people are just going to
do what you do, regardless...

107
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,405
Q.

108
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,918
Okay, you go get
the key, I got this.

109
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,585
No, I'm gonna
stay here and help.

110
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,554
I don't think more
is merrier here.

111
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,425
I don't know... Didn't you
notice your ex is a little...

112
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,085
Stubborn.

113
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,294
I noticed.

114
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,095
Alice and I got
into this together.

115
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,264
I'll get us out, one
way or another.

116
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,372
And I will make
sure that she's okay.

117
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,932
Okay?

118
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,737
Go get the key
while you still can.

119
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,516
We're all kinda counting on you

120
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,772
to bring back all of magic.

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,241
Yeah.

122
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,181
So you lost your
key in the Underworld

123
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,278
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

124
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,787
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

125
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,315
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

126
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,759
I'm an astral projection.

127
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,287
No offense, but
your corpse is ash,

128
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,794
so I think maybe you might
be in a little bit of denial.

129
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,736
I mean, look, weren't
you supposed to report

130
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,967
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

131
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,201
Yeah.

132
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,709
And I burned my
body to avoid that.

133
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,878
Look, if we do not
get to the Underworld

134
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,972
before Benedict moves
on... Whatever that means...

135
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,615
Then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

136
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,777
That's not my problem.

137
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,821
No magic is everyone's problem.

138
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,424
Do you think that I
like begging for help?

139
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,982
Especially to you?

140
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,770
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

141
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,354
occasionally stop being a
dick when the fate of the world

142
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,989
is at stake.

143
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,600
Fine. I'll help.

144
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,705
But it's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

145
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,365
So we need a gatekeeper.

146
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,909
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

147
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,475
What about the Library's dragon?

148
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,446
Sorry, couldn't
help but overhear.

149
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,244
At least one side of
the convo, anyway.

150
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,978
The Library has a
dragon? Mmm-hmm.

151
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,351
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

152
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,199
I read about it during
dissertation research.

153
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,091
I assume it's real. Ask
your invisible friend.

154
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,027
Yeah, apparently.

155
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,495
I hear they use it to send

156
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,929
books to and from
the Underworld.

157
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,330
'Cause dragons
are portals, right?

158
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,568
Yeah, except... The
Bookwyrm's too small

159
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,605
to send a full-size
person down there.

160
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,334
Well, what if the
person was a book?

161
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,002
Well, you said you can
project into objects, right?

162
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,207
Yeah, I did... Did
say that, didn't I?

163
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,149
Jesus Christ. Okay,
so this might work.

164
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,348
Except, say, I get the
key and send it back up...

165
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,217
It's stuck in the
Satellite Library,

166
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,986
which is on
another planet, so...

167
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,961
So, we need another Traveler.

168
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,957
Oh, I only know one.

169
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,194
And she got grabbed
by The Beast in Fillory.

170
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,826
Victoria, she was in my class.

171
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,664
Wait a minute,
you know Victoria?

172
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,604
Of course you know her, you...

173
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,232
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

174
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,073
No, I mean, we saved
her and she sorta took off.

175
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,476
I have no idea where she is.

176
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,377
If she's on Earth,
I can find her.

177
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,212
On one condition. I wanna come.

178
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,676
I've never seen an Albanian
pygmy dragon before.

179
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,119
This could be my only shot.

180
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,723
All right, fine. Oh, yes!

181
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,621
This doesn't make
us friends, you know.

182
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,323
Discover anything
useful for Alice?

183
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,463
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

184
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,199
on combining immunosuppressants

185
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,639
with a crystal-based
healing ritual.

186
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,942
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

187
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,180
Not long ago, you
wanted magic so badly

188
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,081
you fought through
a memory wipe.

189
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,151
And now...

190
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,178
It's complicated and personal.

191
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,589
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled millennial bullshit."

192
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,490
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

193
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,872
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

194
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,920
You don't know that.

195
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,431
I know a lot more than you.

196
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,126
You're drunk, and you're mean.

197
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,566
And I'm right.

198
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,704
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

199
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,207
It doesn't fit Alice.

200
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,142
If she keeps it, she'll die.

201
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,611
So what do I do? Take it back.

202
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,215
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

203
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,478
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

204
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,518
You need magic to
initiate the transfer of magic.

205
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,555
Alice has it all.
She'll never do it.

206
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,117
Well, fine. Go get some.

207
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,422
Oh, sure, I'll just
pop over to the store.

208
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,126
Actually, I think I
may know someone

209
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,032
who may be of assistance.

210
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,037
But given their
naked opportunism,

211
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,232
I can't imagine it'll come free.

212
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,284
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

213
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,038
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

214
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,477
He's got us covered. Okay.

215
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,544
Eliot. Hey, guys.

216
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,818
We had the most
wonderful adventure.

217
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,411
We went to the Square of
Time, where no one sleeps.

218
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,581
And it's always light.

219
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,647
A man urinated next to me.

220
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,284
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broadway.

221
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,159
You call it <i>Cats,</i> but it's just
humans in cat greasepaint.

222
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,892
And we tried a
delicacy called pizza

223
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:57,301
at an eatery that
was "Family Style."

224
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,330
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

225
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,535
Hi, Todd.

226
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,009
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

227
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,805
Uh, Fray, did you
enjoy anything at all?

228
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,280
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

229
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,343
I do want you to
like things, you know.

230
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,187
I can tell you want
to be a good father.

231
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,215
It's sort of sweet.

232
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,594
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

233
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,891
With time. Oh!

234
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,900
Let's go with that.

235
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,029
Not to interrupt this
Hallmark moment,

236
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,163
but Todd, you got a sec?

237
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,298
Yeah.

238
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,473
Wait, fairies are real?

239
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,575
Mmm-hmm. I thought
Fray was just nuts.

240
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,412
I mean, she is, but, yeah,

241
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,042
they're real and
they're raging dicks,

242
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,829
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

243
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,790
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

244
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,234
Just make sure
Fray doesn't see 'em,

245
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,955
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

246
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,224
I've got another job for you.

247
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

248
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,960
What's with the feathers?

249
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,872
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

250
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,134
to the Fairy Queen.

251
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,439
Okay. As long as she bought it.

252
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,978
Everyone in the castle did.

253
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,173
Even Prince Fomar and the
Stone Queen headed back

254
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,910
to their mountain/island.

255
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,952
The Fairy Queen has
no idea you were gone.

256
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,748
Well, that's good news, right?

257
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,115
So what's with the face?

258
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,231
Well, this just
took a dark turn.

259
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,546
In exchange for my babies,
you want my bathtub?

260
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,382
You collect toes and eyeballs,
and you think that's weird?

261
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,017
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

262
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,784
curious act of extortion.

263
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,592
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

264
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,821
on the side of the road.

265
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,527
We thought you'd be
alarmed by that too,

266
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,130
given you forced
us into that alliance.

267
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,129
So what's it gonna
be? Your bathtub?

268
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,970
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

269
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,344
It's a strange deal.

270
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,210
Even for me. MARGO: Right.

271
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,641
I should be more specific.

272
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,783
You're giving your bathtub

273
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,286
to the entire
population of Fillory.

274
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,819
We're gonna make a
fondue fountain out of it.

275
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,351
It'll be fun.

276
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,287
And since I'll have a
deal with all Fillorians,

277
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,592
everyone will then
be able to see us.

278
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,525
I suppose you're right.

279
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,159
No more shadow-puppeting.

280
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,103
Just straight-up
puppeting, from now on.

281
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,436
Or hey, you could leave.

282
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,347
There is another
option, you know.

283
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,708
I find my children, and then...

284
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,213
You have till tomorrow.

285
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,345
So have fun on
the little egg hunt,

286
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,850
'cause if you don't
make this deal,

287
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,180
we're about to boil and dye 'em

288
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,721
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

289
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,880
I don't know what that means.

290
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,184
So, if I understand
you correctly,

291
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,095
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

292
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,726
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

293
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,263
Because I need your help.

294
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,895
Well, why should
I trust you now?

295
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,269
You've already lied to me once.

296
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,069
She's lied to me
several times too.

297
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,210
So at least you
know it's not personal.

298
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,636
Like it wasn't personal

299
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,112
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

300
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,445
without so much
as texting me first.

301
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,110
Henry, trust me,
better me than them.

302
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,983
Them. IRENE: Anyone but me.

303
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,819
And don't think the rest of
the board wasn't considering it.

304
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,658
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

305
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,457
Limited reserves.

306
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,257
I just need a little bit.

307
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,130
I gave what I had to a friend.

308
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,343
Why the hell would you do that?

309
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,131
But it is killing her.

310
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,104
So without your help, she
will die and so will the magic.

311
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,967
All right.

312
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,674
Tell me about this Voltaic
Transfer you performed.

313
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,141
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

314
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,708
You knew about this?

315
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,219
I thought I was very clear

316
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,347
about not looking
in the cubbyhole.

317
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,857
You were. That's why I looked.

318
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,085
Fray, what are those?

319
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,027
Fairy eggs. That
Father and Margo took.

320
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,473
You don't know that.
Just when I was starting

321
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,195
to think humans aren't
all bad, they steal babies?

322
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,702
The Fairy Queen
stole you from us.

323
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,262
No, you bargained me
away. I did no such thing.

324
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,902
It was a fair deal.
This is kidnapping.

325
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,311
Unlike you, we have honor.

326
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,112
You're not a fairy, Fray.

327
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,884
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

328
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,718
as anything but human?

329
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,614
Because she won't.

330
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,024
That's not true.

331
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,789
Um, didn't you say she
named you Frail Human?

332
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,162
That's pretty cold.

333
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,700
Humans are complicated.

334
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,134
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

335
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,468
Yeah, like, I once
donated a kidney

336
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,235
to this girl I really liked.

337
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,402
Only, it turned out she didn't
actually need it for a transplant.

338
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,676
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

339
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,080
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

340
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:18,190
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

341
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,790
Family is about
loyalty, my love.

342
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,100
Fuck you!

343
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,201
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

344
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,007
She slept with Josh.

345
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,513
On our Fillorian spring break.

346
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,049
While he and I
were still dating.

347
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,948
Are you really still
upset about Josh?

348
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,078
Can't we move past that? I
mean, we were like sisters.

349
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,622
Yeah, do you not get that that
only makes it more fucked up?

350
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,000
Sorry, could we just
focus for a second?

351
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,515
It's just kind of important.

352
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,688
Look, even if magic was
back, and these tattoos worked,

353
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,095
I still wouldn't help you.

354
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,763
'Cause I don't trust you.

355
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,267
Okay, will you just hold
on to this for a second?

356
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,375
Victoria, be real with
me. You owe me that.

357
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,844
I know. It's just not
that simple, okay?

358
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,881
I work with this group
now, and I can't just...

359
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,108
Group?

360
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,313
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

361
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,450
So believe me, we have no
problem dicking over the Library.

362
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,923
It's just... we got
something going on.

363
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,892
Wait, is your boss...

364
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,260
Is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

365
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,893
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriet person,

366
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,265
can you get her to help?

367
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,998
She doesn't exactly

368
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,595
like me. QUENTIN: Great.

369
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,903
So Victoria hates
Poppy. Harriet hates you.

370
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,874
So it makes perfect sense.

371
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,004
Some people are
just so emotional.

372
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,607
Harriet does like Kady, though.

373
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,242
Okay, great, then
let's talk to Kady.

374
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,812
Where is she?

375
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,126
Shit.

376
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:07,961
Kady.

377
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:16,040
All right, I can help you.
But you'll owe me a favor.

378
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,603
What's the favor?

379
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,276
To be determined.

380
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,479
Trust her. What could go wrong?

381
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,778
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

382
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,320
It was buy the place

383
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,615
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

384
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,126
and turn this place into
a... An amusement park.

385
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,319
At least I care.

386
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,622
You care about something.

387
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,664
Do we have a deal?

388
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,066
Is that cocaine?

389
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,407
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

390
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,106
But, yes, you will
have to snort it.

391
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,580
I'm sorry, what creature?

392
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,241
I thought you had batteries.

393
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,413
Look, you asked me for my help.

394
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,147
This is what I have to offer.

395
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,251
Okay, Kady is in
the High-Risk Ward,

396
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,552
down the hallway over here.

397
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,022
The ward is locked.
So is Kady's room.

398
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,789
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

399
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,058
Okay.

400
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,257
Those squiggles are guards?

401
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,359
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

402
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,528
Gotcha.

403
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,595
So, how are we gonna
get in past all the security?

404
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,437
We're not. They are
gonna bring her to us.

405
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,534
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

406
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,772
for more than 15 days...
They have to bring in

407
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,042
outside doctors to
certify she's crazy.

408
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,208
Yeah, and we will
be those doctors.

409
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,344
They'll buy that?

410
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,163
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

411
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,655
No, it's like a state hospital.

412
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,782
Yeah, their computer
systems are older than we are.

413
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,022
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

414
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,118
Good thinking.

415
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,390
Should I be concerned

416
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,841
that you both know
so much about this?

417
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,299
Mmm...

418
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,395
There was a "crazy" time.

419
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,505
Okay, whatever, uh...

420
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,516
But it's not like you two
can just walk out of there

421
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,769
with a patient.

422
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,401
No, but Kady can
walk herself out

423
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,378
if she has a security badge.

424
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,983
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

425
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,280
No, I will.

426
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,549
Here we are.

427
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,202
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr...

428
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,328
Kline. Midtown
Mental Health Clinic.

429
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,471
Which is where we work.

430
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,805
Yes. We're here
to do an evaluation.

431
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,969
Great. Mind if I sit in?

432
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,418
No, not at all. Please do.

433
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:47,250
Okay, um, so, Kady,

434
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:52,225
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

435
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:57,362
from delusions, and that
you've been talking to someone

436
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,133
named Penny?

437
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,466
Oh, um, yeah.

438
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,905
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

439
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,541
We're breaking you out of here.

440
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,775
Kady, can you tell
us about Penny?

441
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:14,019
Yeah, yeah, he was a... My ex.

442
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,783
But I don't see him anymore.

443
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,654
Quentin's gonna hand
you a security badge.

444
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,249
It'll get you out of the ward.

445
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,192
When you're on
break, in the day room,

446
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,696
use it to sneak
out. We'll be waiting.

447
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,696
Oh. Someone has
lost their badge.

448
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,203
Great.

449
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,541
What now?

450
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,849
What if she doesn't
take the deal?

451
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,748
Then what do we do? Or, no...

452
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,151
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

453
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,415
Stop it.

454
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,218
It's going to be fine.

455
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,501
We could cut our losses.

456
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,869
We could head back
to Earth and regroup.

457
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,624
We could finish the
quest, restore magic,

458
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,324
and then maybe revisit this

459
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,161
when we stand a fighting chance.

460
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,836
You and I both
sacrificed a lot for Fillory.

461
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,577
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

462
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,471
to the albino supermodel?

463
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,644
Bitch took my eye.

464
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,146
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

465
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,872
But what if we're
making things worse?

466
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,518
There wasn't a blood test
to tell me to be High Queen.

467
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,848
I chose it.

468
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,290
And I have had to fight
for every shred of authority.

469
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,956
And no offense,

470
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,093
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

471
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,797
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

472
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,438
Those fairy bitches wanna
come for my crown, well...

473
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,442
I'll shove it up their
fucking eggholes.

474
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,911
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

475
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,953
I'm on board.

476
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,220
Maybe try the key.

477
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,689
What? Well, I don't know.

478
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,939
Like, wave it
around or something.

479
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,556
Maybe a keyhole
will appear in the wall.

480
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,826
This is stupid.

481
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,131
And I feel sick.

482
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,927
Why are you here anyway?

483
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,766
We already stuck
a fork in this, Penny.

484
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,738
We're helping you.
All of a sudden?

485
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,437
After I was such a ray of
sunshine to you last time.

486
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,305
We need you to talk to Harriet.

487
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,314
We need her help
getting the next key,

488
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,752
so we can bring magic back.

489
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,649
All right. And
where's the next key?

490
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,488
In the Underworld.

491
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,995
I'm the only one
who can get it, Kady.

492
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,858
You're doing it
again, aren't you?

493
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,869
Throwing your life at
a problem to solve it.

494
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,470
I'm tired, Penny.

495
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,044
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

496
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,570
I thought we weren't a couple.

497
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,111
That's not funny.

498
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,585
It's a little funny.

499
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,781
Hey, yell at me.

500
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,688
I don't want to. I
am tired of yelling.

501
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,955
Yell at me.

502
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,894
I'm getting you
out of this room.

503
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,226
Come on!

504
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,039
Okay, Kady.

505
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,179
Hand over the contraband.

506
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,340
What's up?

507
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,554
Go, team.

508
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,801
Alice, what're you doing here?

509
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,268
What are you?

510
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,572
I thought you were
in a psych ward.

511
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,867
I was.

512
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,640
Now I'm the sanest
woman in America.

513
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,739
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

514
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,149
I actually can't
really feel anything.

515
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,652
It's fantastic.

516
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,948
If I didn't know
better, I would say

517
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,513
that you were
just trying to cast

518
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,456
an intermediate unlocking charm.

519
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,460
That would mean
that I have magic,

520
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,462
which we both
know is impossible.

521
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,020
Right.

522
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,034
Well, don't bother. I
already looted the place.

523
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,932
Brakebills may be
closed. Black market's not.

524
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,569
Gotta make a living.

525
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,838
You looking for
something special?

526
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,303
Some Boswellia.

527
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,209
Bloodstone, steroids.

528
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,739
Fuck me.

529
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,883
So you do have magic.

530
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,978
What do you know
about transplants?

531
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,545
I know you'd have
to be desperate

532
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,557
to try something that stupid.

533
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,217
Well, who am I to judge?

534
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,855
I almost blew a
werewolf so he'd turn me.

535
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,231
Magical creatures...

536
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,792
They can hang on to
their magic just fine, so...

537
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,764
Please...

538
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,633
If you have anything
that can help me...

539
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,377
Well, Boswellia and
Bloodstone are total bullshit.

540
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,573
But steroids
might help a little.

541
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,510
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

542
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,986
It says take two.
You should take eight.

543
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,521
Thank you. We're
all screwed anyway.

544
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,081
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

545
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,392
<i>Dr. Bailey, you're needed
at nurse's station 204.</i>

546
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,491
<i>Dr. Bailey...</i> Nurse coming.

547
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,373
I know you don't
wanna talk right now.

548
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,005
I sure don't. Yeah,
yeah, hate me later.

549
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,747
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

550
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,780
You're the best
thing in my life.

551
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,284
Short life, granted, but...

552
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,716
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

553
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:54,885
Well, you should.

554
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,725
It's crazy we lived this long.

555
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,958
We met. We had great sex.

556
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,796
I got to know you.

557
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,531
I'm lucky.

558
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,563
What's your point?

559
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,664
Don't be mad too long.

560
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,973
I want you to be happy.

561
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,803
Jesus Christ.

562
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,005
I can't be.

563
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,048
Without you, you fucking idiot.

564
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,683
But isn't that just adult life?

565
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,014
Accepting your own misery.

566
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,104
MALE NURSE OVER
PA: <i>Code Green...</i>

567
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,097
Shit. I guess they
found my room.

568
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,563
Come on.

569
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,928
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

570
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,593
and the key
locked up in there...

571
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,728
I know, I know.
Quit being so twitchy.

572
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:39,999
You look suspicious.

573
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,904
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

574
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,382
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

575
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,504
<i>Everyone stay in their
room.</i> Shit. Lockdown.

576
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,979
<i>And stay calm. We
are on lockdown.</i>

577
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,539
We're gonna have to help her...

578
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,417
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

579
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,447
You sure this is gonna work?

580
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:58,821
It's fire safety protocol.

581
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,350
How do you not know that?

582
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,407
NURSE OVER PA:
<i>Attention, please proceed</i>

583
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,990
<i>to the nearest fire exit</i>

584
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,036
<i>- and evacuate immediately.</i>
- See? Works every time.

585
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,866
How many times
have you done this?

586
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,235
<i>And evacuate immediately.</i>

587
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,431
Keep it moving!

588
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,003
I told you we'd figure it out.

589
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,208
Shit. PENNY: Damn it.

590
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,493
Whoa!

591
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,387
Come on, let's go.

592
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,864
Well.

593
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,474
Alice is gone.

594
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,634
Might be time to use this.

595
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,209
To cast a locator spell.

596
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,141
Ugh.

597
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,584
Reminds me of the old days.

598
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,414
I don't wanna know.

599
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,556
This magic... It
looks different.

600
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,190
It feels different.

601
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,703
If it's working,
let's not split hairs.

602
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,169
Find her.

603
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,238
Wait a minute. What's
Alice doing there?

604
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,646
I'm blind. Are you
going to tell me?

605
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,450
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

606
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,419
She was upset and
tried to take them.

607
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,614
I stopped her, but she ran
away and we can't find her.

608
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,020
This is not good.

609
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,525
And real bad timing, El.

610
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:46,454
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

611
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,009
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

612
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,433
we need to put a pin in it.

613
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,979
There's nothing we
can do about it right now.

614
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,972
Perhaps I can help. Fray.

615
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,307
We've been having quite a talk.

616
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,039
Eggs and portals and quests.

617
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,379
So much going on
I didn't know about.

618
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,679
We really should discuss.

619
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,147
Crap.

620
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:16,484
Fray? How could you?
Like you said, family loyalty.

621
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,162
I've considered your offer.

622
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:26,131
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

623
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,169
I won't hurt yours.

624
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,536
Wait. What?

625
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,635
No. Don't you touch her.

626
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,940
But my Queen...

627
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:38,507
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

628
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,479
No one needs to
get hurt. I agree.

629
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,757
I... I helped you. I...

630
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,792
Yes.

631
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,352
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

632
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,091
Betrayed your own parents.

633
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,366
Why would I ever trust you?

634
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,731
I just found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

635
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,037
I just wanted all this to stop.

636
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,971
So let's stop this.

637
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,047
We gotta give her the eggs.

638
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,047
There's gotta be another
way. That's our only leverage.

639
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,987
I know, but she's my daughter.

640
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,363
We have a whole
country to think about.

641
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,228
I can't be the dad that
turns his back on his kid.

642
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,635
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

643
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,638
What're you saying? What?

644
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,002
Explain.

645
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,972
Now...

646
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,141
Or it's poached eggs tonight.

647
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,016
Fray isn't yours.

648
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,159
Your real daughter
died during childbirth.

649
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,121
She died?

650
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,795
Oh, gods, I...

651
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,967
Oh, no. Oh, no.

652
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,601
That is the sound of
your leverage dying.

653
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,982
You'd better shake on
this deal while you still can.

654
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,715
No, no way.

655
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,888
Please. No.

656
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,518
I'm asking for this favor.

657
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,367
Okay, okay, look.

658
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,846
Look, I'm... I am grateful
for everything you did for me.

659
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,977
For Penny.

660
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,717
So how about this?

661
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,479
What if...

662
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,461
Then we both get what we want.

663
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,502
So we're gonna rob the Library?

664
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,971
Oh, awesome. No, not awesome.

665
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,513
Stupid.

666
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,776
It is hard enough to
sneak one person in there.

667
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,849
How the hell are they
gonna get the whole group in?

668
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,524
It's the dumbest
fucking plan I've ever...

669
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,186
Penny's got some notes.

670
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,489
You said you wanted to do this.

671
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,154
You don't know the
defenses this place has.

672
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,697
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

673
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,657
Are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

674
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,204
You've been waiting to say that.

675
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,938
I know what I'm doing.

676
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,141
My head's clear now.

677
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,868
You got me out.
We'll get the key out.

678
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,740
You just... You have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

679
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,191
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

680
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,843
Being on the
Astral Plane's great.

681
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,613
Just a little over
being stuck here.

682
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,987
Bringing magic back is the
only way I see out of this.

683
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,256
Wouldn't it be funny if
we made it out of this?

684
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,326
I'd laugh pretty hard.

685
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,864
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

686
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,341
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

687
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,139
Yeah, I heard that one before.

688
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,408
I love you.

689
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,243
I'm sorry we're cursed.

690
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,254
He's gone.

691
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,662
What, like, gone?
Gone-gone? Like...

692
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,265
Like, to the Library gone?

693
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,668
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

694
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,666
So let's not fuck
it up on our end.

695
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,742
Are you sure you wanna do this?

696
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,786
It's not exactly like
everyone thinks...

697
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,446
Jonesing for blood.

698
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,757
Watching everyone you know die.

699
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,115
That is, if you don't
kill them yourself.

700
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,857
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

701
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,764
You seem smart. Too
smart to want all this.

702
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,333
I don't want it.

703
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,334
Then why... It's none
of your business.

704
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,306
Well, then, no.

705
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,470
Becoming a creature...
No offense... Is the only way

706
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,842
I can keep my magic.

707
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,790
Why are you trying
to talk me out of it?

708
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,410
I'm not. But are you so sure
this'll do what you want it to?

709
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,077
No, but I'm out of options,

710
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,882
so will you take
my money or not?

711
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,848
All right.

712
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,730
Alice, let's go.

713
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,068
Jesus, how did you find me?

714
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,807
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

715
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,741
All I found were
shitty vampires.

716
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,240
Can we please go?

717
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,675
No, just leave. Continue.

718
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,676
Leave or I break it.

719
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,188
Ah! Get off me!

720
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,450
How did you do that?

721
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,993
Get out.

722
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,459
No, I gave you my money.

723
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,138
Not enough to deal
with hedge witch Buffy.

724
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,186
Good luck.

725
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,696
Out!

726
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,231
When we said we'd
explore our options,

727
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,069
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

728
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,475
I researched. This
is the only way.

729
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,636
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

730
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,412
Okay. I don't need your
help, you condescending bitch.

731
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,294
No, Julia.

732
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,409
I transferred it all back.

733
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,008
I'm sorry.

734
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:23,317
All you did was try to help
me, and I almost killed you.

735
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,922
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

736
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,755
I guess we're even.

737
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,662
We're not, but that's
nice of you to say.

738
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,534
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

739
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,536
I mean, what do
people in limbo do?

740
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,165
It's excruciating.

741
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,173
You know, and I just
thought maybe if I could just...

742
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,373
Fix it?

743
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,915
I know the feeling.

744
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,548
Really.

745
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,453
I still see Reynard.

746
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,750
You do?

747
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:07,162
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

748
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,029
Do you think
maybe it's because...

749
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,334
I think it's because
it happened.

750
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,576
And there's nothing
magic about it anymore.

751
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,308
When things happen,
they leave a mark.

752
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,348
Figuring out how to
deal with it takes time.

753
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,715
I get what Quentin
always saw in you.

754
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,184
You're brave.

755
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:35,993
Just stubborn.

756
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,656
I think that's why
you can hold it.

757
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,095
All the pain, and all the
shit you didn't ask for,

758
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,760
that's what made you you.

759
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,738
And that's why this magic fits.

760
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:52,301
Maybe sometimes life is random

761
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,845
and unfair.

762
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,404
You know, it doesn't
always ask our permission.

763
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,548
It just is.

764
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,081
Honestly...

765
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,558
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

766
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,197
Except that it's not
his anymore, Julia.

767
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,564
I felt it. It... It's yours.

768
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,194
For whatever reason.

769
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,400
So what are you
gonna do with it?

770
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,788
Fen.

771
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,324
Maybe you shouldn't be
holding sharp objects right now.

772
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,726
My father was a knife maker.

773
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,662
This is how I've
always calmed down.

774
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,213
When our daughter was born,

775
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,641
they took her away.

776
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:10,152
They wouldn't let me hold
her. I never heard her cry.

777
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,625
I should have known.

778
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,324
How could I not know?

779
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,960
God, I was so
ready to believe Fray.

780
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,925
I think deep down I thought...

781
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:31,607
If we just felt like a family,

782
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,669
if I just willed it hard enough,

783
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,945
then that would be real.

784
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,314
'Cause this...

785
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,655
How am I supposed
to live with it?

786
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,455
Oh, God.

787
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,190
God, Fen, I'm so sorry.

788
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,023
You would've been...

789
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:55,124
No, you were such a great mom.

790
00:38:55,867 --> 00:39:01,431
And I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

791
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,499
You deserve so
much better than this.

792
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,044
I'm gonna need some time.

793
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,651
I can't be in Fillory right now.

794
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,380
Okay, okay.

795
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,368
Hey.

796
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,040
Okay, dude. Spill.

797
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,471
What's up?

798
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,575
What if... Penny
doesn't find Benedict

799
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,880
or the key?

800
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,683
Or he gets caught by
a Librarian, or we do,

801
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,452
or any part of this
ridiculous plan fails?

802
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,891
It seems like you're
worrying about a lot of stuff

803
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,292
you can't control, here.

804
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:01,299
Everything that we're
doing, if we mess it up,

805
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:04,461
it's not just me who suffers.

806
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,663
It's not just us who suffers.

807
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,640
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

808
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,300
No, it's not the multiverse.

809
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,038
Magic doesn't exist
in this universe.

810
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,046
It doesn't mean it's
gone in alternate realities.

811
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,673
That is not the point. Oh, boy.

812
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,847
What're you doing?

813
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,615
Short-circuiting
your panic attack.

814
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,315
It's getting tiresome.

815
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,318
Okay, I'm confused.

816
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,659
It's sweet how much you
care about your friends.

817
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,322
Even the ones
that don't like you.

818
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,166
Let's just have some fun.

819
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,864
Seems like the chances
of everyone surviving

820
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,564
go up if we do that.

821
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,964
Hmm?

822
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,086
Your eggs, I take it, are fine?

823
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,180
Yes.

824
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,417
What have you done with Fray?

825
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,618
She did not want
to return with me.

826
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,990
Her fate is her own.

827
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,933
Is the rest done?

828
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,300
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

829
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,468
May they be clean forever.

830
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,841
I'm sure they'll
appreciate the gift.

831
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,036
While we're at it.

832
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,205
What was your end game anyway?

833
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,918
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

834
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,319
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world domination

835
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,380
"mega-villain" bullshit?

836
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,722
It's a sign of your
human privilege

837
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,127
that you see things so simply.

838
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,167
But it is simple, Lady...
You made us look crazy.

839
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,101
And aligning with the
Floaters made us look stupid.

840
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,933
But now everyone will understand

841
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,871
what was really happening to us.

842
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,837
Will they? You made the deal.

843
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,469
Everyone can see you now.

844
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,114
True. And they can see you too.

845
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,879
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

846
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,319
Why are we
stopping? I don't know.

847
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,824
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

848
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,484
for some time.

849
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,426
I can no longer help you.

850
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:13,192
Help us with what?

851
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,163
Eliot... This is sounding

852
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,331
a little too <i>Les
Mis</i> for my liking.

853
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,442
Okay, Bambi? They're armed.

854
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,243
Where the hell is she? Oh, shit.

855
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:31,915
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

856
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,147
Hold on! Hold on!

857
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,887
I'm your Queen,
you motherfuckers!
