00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,772
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,602
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,403
At your service.
You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,119
PENNY: <i>I'll go to
Fillory on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,183
That girl you saw in the
dungeon, we'll get her out.

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,441
Victoria.

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,641
You found me.

9
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:15,876
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,393
No, I have to put
myself back together.

11
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,885
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,183
You are a danger to
yourself and to others.

13
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,518
No.

14
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,251
The fairies aren't
just terraforming,

15
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,156
they're growing an army.

ELIOT: <i>We need
a plan bigger than</i>

17
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,187
just assassinating
the Queen. We need...

18
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,823
Hostages, leverage.
Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,924
Did you get the key?
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,162
I'm a terrible
failure. Benedict, no!

21
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,167
POPPY: <i>They don't just
make portals. They are portals.</i>

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,936
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,070
It's magic. I'd do
anything to get it back.

24
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,205
If I could give it
to you, I would.

25
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,216
DEAN: <i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

26
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,377
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,885
God! Alice!

28
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,889
Okay, someone's
gotta hear this, please.

29
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,295
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,808
The little weirdo
wouldn't go to sleep

31
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,198
until I read him
a bedtime story.

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,395
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

33
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,335
Q's probably
already at the tree.

34
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,805
Tick, how are we doing?

35
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,240
Five minutes till the
fairy guards change shifts,

36
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,572
Your Majesties.

37
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,841
Now, no one knows
we're gone, okay?

38
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,108
If the Fairy Queen asks,

39
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,412
we're bedridden with
something contagious.

40
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,781
Like chicken pox.

41
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,411
Certainly, Highness.
But must you leave?

42
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,046
Prince Fomar's people
have been somewhat difficult.

43
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,216
What do you mean?
It seems your union

44
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,123
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

45
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,422
that this land is now theirs.

46
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,487
They've been,
well, pillaging a lot.

47
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,590
I thought perhaps
a royal address...

48
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,134
MARGO: You're
thinking too small.

49
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,693
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,602
Extortion. Exactly!

51
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,267
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

52
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,277
But we can't deal
with the Floaters

53
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,143
until we deal with
the Fairies, got it?

54
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,793
POPPY: I can't believe you
paid the Hudson River dragon

55
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,285
to send you to the Underworld.

56
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,445
That is so cool.

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,078
QUENTIN: Yeah,
well, it was a one-off.

58
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,919
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

59
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,051
I hear she's kinda withholding.

60
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,560
And judge-y.

61
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,105
Anyway, you think your
ghost friend's gonna be able

62
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,189
to help us? There's no "us."

63
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,994
I'm gonna go talk
to Penny alone,

64
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,510
and you're gonna go
back to whatever life

65
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,298
you were willing
to backstab me for.

66
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,738
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

67
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,069
ELIOT: Q!

68
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,769
QUENTIN: Oh, good.

69
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,109
Hey, I don't know if it was
just, like, a super anxious rabbit,

70
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,045
but your message
made things seem kinda...

71
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,310
Dire? They are.

72
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,011
Are those supplies?
MARGO: Hostages.

73
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,383
Who the fuck are you? I'm Poppy.

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,011
I'm helping Quentin
find the next key.

75
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,716
No, she's not
helping me. We're...

76
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,067
Okay, can we hit
pause on the recap

77
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,855
until we're back where
our pasty usurpers

78
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,827
won't kill us all?

00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,975

85
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,879
Alice, can you hear me?

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

87
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,686
I told you, I'm fine.

88
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,740
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

89
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,232
I expected this, okay?

90
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,996
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

91
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,595
There are occasional surges.

92
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,969
That's all this was.

93
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,270
I mean, was that all
this was? A surge?

94
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,539
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

95
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,546
of organ transplant projection.

96
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,708
Attacking itself to
get rid of the invader.

97
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,880
Or maybe it's nothing
at all. Who knows?

98
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,976
Who knows?

99
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,817
Well, we need a
better answer than that.

100
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,949
You wanted to do the
spell. It's all an experiment.

101
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,727
I have no idea what's
going to happen.

102
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,319
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

103
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,729
Energy-balancing
spells, exercises...

104
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,460
I suppose that could work.

105
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,399
Your confidence is overwhelming.

106
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,128
What's the point of lying?

do what you do, regardless...

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,918
Okay, you go get
the key, I got this.

110
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,585
No, I'm gonna
stay here and help.

111
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,554
I don't think more
is merrier here.

00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,425
I don't know... Didn't you
notice your ex is a little...

113
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,085
Stubborn.

114
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,294
I noticed.

115
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,095
Alice and I got
into this together.

116
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,264
I'll get us out, one
way or another.

117
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,372
And I will make
sure that she's okay.

118
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,932
Okay?

119
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,737
Go get the key
while you still can.

120
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,516
We're all kinda counting on you

121
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,772
to bring back all of magic.

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,241
Yeah.

123
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,181
PENNY: So you lost
your key in the Underworld

124
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,278
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

125
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,787
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

126
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,315
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

127
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,759
I'm an astral projection.

128
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,287
No offense, but
your corpse is ash,

129
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,794
so I think maybe you might
be in a little bit of denial.

130
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,736
I mean, look, weren't
you supposed to report

131
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,967
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

132
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,201
Yeah.

133
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,709
And I burned my
body to avoid that.

134
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,878
Look, if we do not
get to the Underworld

135
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,972
before Benedict moves
on... Whatever that means...

136
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,615
Then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

137
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,777
That's not my problem.

138
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,821
No magic is everyone's problem.

139
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,424
Do you think that I
like begging for help?

140
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,982
Especially to you?

141
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,770
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

142
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,354
occasionally stop being a
dick when the fate of the world

143
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,989
is at stake.

144
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,600
Fine. I'll help.

145
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,705
But it's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

146
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,365
So we need a gatekeeper.

147
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,909
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

148
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,475
What about the Library's dragon?

149
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,446
Sorry, couldn't
help but overhear.

150
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,244
At least one side of
the convo, anyway.

151
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,978
The Library has a
dragon? Mmm-hmm.

152
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,351
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

153
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,199
I read about it during
dissertation research.

154
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,091
I assume it's real. Ask
your invisible friend.

155
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,027
Yeah, apparently.

156
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,495
I hear they use it to send

157
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,929
books to and from
the Underworld.

158
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,330
'Cause dragons
are portals, right?

159
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,568
Yeah, except... The
Bookwyrm's too small

160
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,605
to send a full-size
person down there.

161
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,334
Well, what if the
person was a book?

162
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,002
Well, you said you can
project into objects, right?

163
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,207
Yeah, I did... Did
say that, didn't I?

164
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,149
Jesus Christ. Okay,
so this might work.

165
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,348
Except, say, I get the
key and send it back up...

166
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,217
It's stuck in the
Satellite Library,

167
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,986
which is on
another planet, so...

168
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,961
So, we need another Traveler.

169
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,957
Oh, I only know one.

170
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,194
And she got grabbed
by The Beast in Fillory.

171
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,826
(SIGHS) Victoria,
she was in my class.

172
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,664
Wait a minute,
you know Victoria?

173
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,604
Of course you know her, you...

174
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,232
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

175
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,073
No, I mean, we saved
her and she sorta took off.

176
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,476
I have no idea where she is.

177
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,377
If she's on Earth,
I can find her.

178
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,212
On one condition. I wanna come.

179
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,676
I've never seen an Albanian
pygmy dragon before.

180
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,119
This could be my only shot.

181
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,723
All right, fine.
(WHISPERS) Oh, yes!

182
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,621
This doesn't make
us friends, you know.

183
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,323
DEAN: Discover
anything useful for Alice?

184
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,463
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

185
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,199
on combining immunosuppressants

186
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,639
with a crystal-based
healing ritual.

187
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,540
(LAUGHS)

188
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,942
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

189
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,180
Not long ago, you
wanted magic so badly

190
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,081
you fought through
a memory wipe.

191
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,151
And now...

192
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,178
It's complicated and personal.

193
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,589
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled millennial bullshit."

194
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,490
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

195
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,872
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

196
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,920
You don't know that.

197
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,431
I know a lot more than you.

198
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,126
You're drunk, and you're mean.

199
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,566
And I'm right.

200
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,297
(SIGHS)

201
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,704
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

202
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,207
It doesn't fit Alice.

203
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,142
If she keeps it, she'll die.

204
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,611
So what do I do? Take it back.

205
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,215
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

206
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,478
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

207
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,518
You need magic to
initiate the transfer of magic.

208
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,555
Alice has it all.
She'll never do it.

209
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,117
Well, fine. Go get some.

210
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,422
Oh, sure, I'll just
pop over to the store.

211
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,126
Actually, I think I
may know someone

212
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,032
who may be of assistance.

213
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,037
But given their
naked opportunism,

214
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,232
I can't imagine it'll come free.

215
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,284
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

216
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,038
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

217
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,477
He's got us covered. Okay.

218
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,544
Eliot. Hey, guys.

219
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,818
We had the most
wonderful adventure.

220
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,411
We went to the Square of
Time, where no one sleeps.

221
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,581
And it's always light.

222
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,647
A man urinated next to me.

223
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,284
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broadway.

224
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,159
You call it <i>Cats,</i> but it's just
humans in cat greasepaint.

225
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,892
And we tried a
delicacy called pizza

226
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:57,301
at an eatery that
was "Family Style."

227
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,330
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

228
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,535
Hi, Todd.

229
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,009
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

230
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,805
Uh, Fray, did you
enjoy anything at all?

231
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,280
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

232
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,343
I do want you to
like things, you know.

233
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,187
I can tell you want
to be a good father.

234
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,215
It's sort of sweet.

235
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,594
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

236
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,891
With time. Oh!

237
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,900
Let's go with that.

238
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,029
Not to interrupt this
Hallmark moment,

239
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,163
but Todd, you got a sec?

240
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,298
Yeah.

241
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,473
Wait, fairies are real?

242
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,575
Mmm-hmm. I thought
Fray was just nuts.

243
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,412
I mean, she is, but, yeah,

244
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,042
they're real and
they're raging dicks,

245
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,829
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

246
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,790
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

247
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,234
Just make sure
Fray doesn't see 'em,

248
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,955
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

249
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,224
I've got another job for you.

250
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

251
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,960
ELIOT: What's with the feathers?

252
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,872
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

253
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,134
to the Fairy Queen.

254
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,439
Okay. As long as she bought it.

255
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,978
Everyone in the castle did.

256
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,173
Even Prince Fomar and the
Stone Queen headed back

257
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,910
to their mountain/island.

258
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,952
The Fairy Queen has
no idea you were gone.

259
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,748
Well, that's good news, right?

260
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,115
So what's with the face?

261
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,525
(FLIES BUZZING)

262
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,231
Well, this just
took a dark turn.

263
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,546
In exchange for my babies,
you want my bathtub?

264
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,382
You collect toes and eyeballs,
and you think that's weird?

265
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,017
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

266
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,784
curious act of extortion.

267
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,592
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

268
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,821
on the side of the road.

269
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,527
MARGO: We thought
you'd be alarmed by that too,

270
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,130
given you forced
us into that alliance.

271
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,129
So what's it gonna
be? Your bathtub?

272
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,970
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

273
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,344
It's a strange deal.

274
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,210
Even for me. MARGO: Right.

275
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,641
I should be more specific.

276
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,783
You're giving your bathtub

277
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,286
to the entire
population of Fillory.

278
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,819
We're gonna make a
fondue fountain out of it.

279
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,351
It'll be fun.

280
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,287
And since I'll have a
deal with all Fillorians,

281
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,592
everyone will then
be able to see us.

282
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,525
I suppose you're right.

283
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,159
ELIOT: No more shadow-puppeting.

284
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,103
Just straight-up
puppeting, from now on.

285
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,436
Or hey, you could leave.

286
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,347
FAIRY QUEEN: There is
another option, you know.

287
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,708
I find my children, and then...

288
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,213
You have till tomorrow.

289
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,345
So have fun on
the little egg hunt,

290
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,850
'cause if you don't
make this deal,

291
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,180
we're about to boil and dye 'em

292
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,721
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

293
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,880
I don't know what that means.

294
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,184
So, if I understand
you correctly,

295
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,095
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

296
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,726
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

297
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,263
Because I need your help.

298
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,895
Well, why should
I trust you now?

299
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,269
You've already lied to me once.

300
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,069
She's lied to me
several times too.

301
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,210
So at least you
know it's not personal.

302
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,636
Like it wasn't personal

303
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,112
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

304
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,445
without so much
as texting me first.

305
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,110
Henry, trust me,
better me than them.

306
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,983
Them. IRENE: Anyone but me.

307
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,819
And don't think the rest of
the board wasn't considering it.

308
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,658
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

309
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,457
Limited reserves.

310
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,257
I just need a little bit.

311
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,130
I gave what I had to a friend.

312
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,343
Why the hell would you do that?

313
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,131
But it is killing her.

314
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,104
So without your help, she
will die and so will the magic.

315
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,967
All right.

316
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,674
Tell me about this Voltaic
Transfer you performed.

317
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,141
TODD: Oh, shit.
Margo's gonna kill me.

318
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,708
You knew about this?

319
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,219
I thought I was very clear

320
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,347
about not looking
in the cubbyhole.

321
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,857
You were. That's why I looked.

322
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,085
Fray, what are those?

323
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,027
Fairy eggs. That
Father and Margo took.

324
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,473
You don't know that.
Just when I was starting

325
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,195
to think humans aren't
all bad, they steal babies?

326
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,702
The Fairy Queen
stole you from us.

327
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,262
No, you bargained me
away. I did no such thing.

328
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,902
It was a fair deal.
This is kidnapping.

329
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,311
Unlike you, we have honor.

330
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,112
You're not a fairy, Fray.

331
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,884
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

332
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,718
as anything but human?

333
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,614
Because she won't.

334
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,024
That's not true.

335
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,789
Um, didn't you say she
named you Frail Human?

336
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,162
That's pretty cold.

337
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,700
FEN: Humans are complicated.

338
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,134
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

339
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,468
Yeah, like, I once
donated a kidney

340
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,235
to this girl I really liked.

341
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,402
Only, it turned out she didn't
actually need it for a transplant.

342
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,676
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

343
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,080
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

344
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:18,190
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

345
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,790
Family is about
loyalty, my love.

Fuck you!

348
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,603
(SIGHS)

349
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,201
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

350
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,007
VICTORIA: She slept with Josh.

351
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,513
On our Fillorian spring break.

352
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,049
While he and I
were still dating.

353
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,948
Are you really still
upset about Josh?

354
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,078
Can't we move past that? I
mean, we were like sisters.

355
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,622
Yeah, do you not get that that
only makes it more fucked up?

356
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,000
Sorry, could we just
focus for a second?

357
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,515
It's just kind of important.

358
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,688
Look, even if magic was
back, and these tattoos worked,

359
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,095
I still wouldn't help you.

360
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,763
'Cause I don't trust you.

361
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,267
Okay, will you just hold
on to this for a second?

362
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,375
Victoria, be real with
me. You owe me that.

363
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,844
I know. It's just not
that simple, okay?

364
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,881
I work with this group
now, and I can't just...

365
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,108
Group?

366
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,313
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

367
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,450
So believe me, we have no
problem dicking over the Library.

368
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,923
It's just... we got
something going on.

369
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,892
Wait, is your boss...

370
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,260
Is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

371
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,893
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriet person,

372
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,265
can you get her to help?

373
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,998
PENNY: She doesn't exactly

374
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,595
like me. QUENTIN: Great.

375
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,903
So Victoria hates
Poppy. Harriet hates you.

376
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,874
So it makes perfect sense.

377
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,004
Some people are
just so emotional.

378
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,607
Harriet does like Kady, though.

379
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,242
Okay, great, then
let's talk to Kady.

380
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,812
Where is she?

381
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,126
Shit.

382
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:07,961
Kady.

383
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:16,040
All right, I can help you.
But you'll owe me a favor.

384
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,603
What's the favor?

385
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,276
To be determined. (SCOFFS)

386
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,479
Trust her. What could go wrong?

387
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,778
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

388
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,320
It was buy the place

389
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,615
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

390
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,126
and turn this place into
a... An amusement park.

391
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,319
At least I care.

392
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,622
You care about something.

393
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,664
Do we have a deal?

394
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,066
Is that cocaine?

395
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,407
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

396
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,106
But, yes, you will
have to snort it.

397
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,580
I'm sorry, what creature?

398
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,241
I thought you had batteries.

399
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,413
Look, you asked me for my help.

400
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,147
This is what I have to offer.

401
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,251
Okay, Kady is in
the High-Risk Ward,

402
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,552
down the hallway over here.

403
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,022
The ward is locked.
So is Kady's room.

404
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,789
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

405
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,058
QUENTIN: Okay.

406
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,257
Those squiggles are guards?

407
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,359
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

408
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,528
POPPY: Gotcha.

409
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,595
So, how are we gonna
get in past all the security?

410
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,437
We're not. They are
gonna bring her to us.

411
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,534
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

412
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,772
for more than 15 days...
They have to bring in

413
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,042
outside doctors to
certify she's crazy.

414
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,208
Yeah, and we will
be those doctors.

415
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,344
PENNY: They'll buy that?

416
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,163
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

417
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,655
No, it's like a state hospital.

418
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,782
Yeah, their computer
systems are older than we are.

419
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,022
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

420
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,118
Good thinking.

421
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,390
Should I be concerned

422
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,841
that you both know
so much about this?

423
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,299
Mmm...

424
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,395
There was a "crazy" time.

425
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,505
Okay, whatever, uh...

426
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,516
But it's not like you two
can just walk out of there

427
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,769
with a patient.

428
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,401
No, but Kady can
walk herself out

429
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,378
if she has a security badge.

430
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,983
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

431
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,280
No, I will.

432
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,549
Here we are.

433
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,202
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr...

434
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,328
Kline. Midtown
Mental Health Clinic.

435
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,471
Which is where we work.

436
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,805
Yes. We're here
to do an evaluation.

437
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,969
Great. Mind if I sit in?

438
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,418
No, not at all. Please do.

439
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:47,250
Okay, um, so, Kady,

440
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:52,225
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

441
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:57,362
from delusions, and that
you've been talking to someone

442
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,133
named Penny?

443
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,466
Oh, um, yeah.

444
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,905
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

445
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,541
We're breaking you out of here.

446
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,775
Kady, can you tell
us about Penny?

447
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:14,019
Yeah, yeah, he was a... My ex.

448
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,783
But I don't see him anymore.

449
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,654
Quentin's gonna hand
you a security badge.

450
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,249
It'll get you out of the ward.

451
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,192
When you're on
break, in the day room,

452
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,696
use it to sneak
out. We'll be waiting.

lost their badge.

455

PENNY: Great.

456
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,541
What now?

457
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,849
What if she doesn't
take the deal?

458
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,748
Then what do we do? Or, no...

459
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,151
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

460
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,415

461
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,218
It's going to be fine.

462
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,501
ELIOT: We could cut our losses.

463
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,869
We could head back
to Earth and regroup.

464
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,624
We could finish the
quest, restore magic,

465
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,324
and then maybe revisit this

466
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,161
when we stand a fighting chance.

467
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,836
You and I both
sacrificed a lot for Fillory.

468
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,577
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

469

Hey, I don't wanna leave.

472
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,872
But what if we're
making things worse?

473
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,518
There wasn't a blood test
to tell me to be High Queen.

474
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,848
I chose it.

475
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,290
And I have had to fight
for every shred of authority.

476
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,956
And no offense,

477
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,093
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

478
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,797
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

come for my crown, well...

480

a fork in this, Penny.

We need her help
getting the next key,

so we can bring magic back.

again, aren't you?

better, I would say

just trying to cast

532
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,460

that I have magic,

know is impossible.

700
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,613
Just a little over
being stuck here.

Wouldn't it be funny if
we made it out of this?

704
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,326
I'd laugh pretty hard.

705
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,864
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

706

I mean, what do
people in limbo do?

765

thought maybe if I could just...

Do you think
maybe it's because...

I think it's because
it happened.

775
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,576
And there's nothing
magic about it anymore.

they leave a mark.

deal with it takes time.

always saw in you.

You're brave.

780
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:35,993
Just stubborn.

781
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,656
I think that's why
you can hold it.

All the pain, and all the
shit you didn't ask for,

783

that's what made you you.

784
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,738
And that's why this magic fits.

Maybe sometimes life is random

786

always ask our permission.

Honestly...

790
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,558
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

791
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,197
Except that it's not
his anymore, Julia.

792
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,564
I felt it. It... It's yours.

793

For whatever reason.

794
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,400

gonna do with it?

Maybe you shouldn't be
holding sharp objects right now.

always calmed down.

800
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,641
they took her away.

They wouldn't let me hold
her. I never heard her cry.

802
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,625
I should have known.

803
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,324
How could I not know?

804
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,960
God, I was so
ready to believe Fray.

805
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,925

If we just felt like a family,

807
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,669
if I just willed it hard enough,

808
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,945
then that would be real.

and an even shittier husband.

much better than this.
