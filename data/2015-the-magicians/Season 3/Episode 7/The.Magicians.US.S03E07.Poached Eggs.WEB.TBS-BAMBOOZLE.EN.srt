1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,530
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,510
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,340
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,360
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,990
I'll go to Fillory on one condition.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,130
That girl you saw in the
dungeon... we'll get her out.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,810
Victoria.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,890
You found me.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,950
Look, I'm here.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,930
No, I have to put myself back together.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,030
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,580
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,920
No.

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,620
The fairies aren't just terraforming,

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,280
they're growing an army.

16
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,850
We need a plan bigger than

17
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,350
just assassinating the Queen. We need...

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,190
Hostages, leverage. Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,290
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,530
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,280
They don't just make portals.
They are portals.

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,300
The key way to the Underworld.

23
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,280
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,510
If I could give it to you, I would.

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,510
I see the transfer worked.

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,180
Ah... Alice!

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,280
Okay, someone's gotta hear this, please.

29
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,250
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,130
The little weirdo wouldn't go to sleep
until I read him a bedtime story.

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,600
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,500
Q's probably already at the tree.

33
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,970
Tick, how are we doing?

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,430
Five minutes till
the fairy guards change shifts,

35
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,770
Your Majesties.

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,010
Now, no one knows we're gone, okay?

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,610
If the Fairy Queen asks, we're
bedridden with something contagious.

38
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,940
Like chicken pox.

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,610
Certainly, Highness. But must you leave?

40
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,340
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat... difficult.

41
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,380
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

42
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,290
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

43
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,620
that this land is now theirs.

44
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,660
They've been, well, pillaging... a lot.

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,790
I-I thought perhaps a royal address...

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,290
You're thinking too small.

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,860
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

48
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,800
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

49
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,470
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,470
But we can't deal with the Floaters

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,410
until we deal with the Fairies, got it?

52
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,860
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

53
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,430
to send you to the Underworld.

54
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,590
That is so cool.

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

56
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,030
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

57
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,170
Ah, I hear she's kinda withholding.

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,520
And judge-y.

59
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,120
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able to help us?

60
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,970
There's no "us." I'm gonna
go talk to Penny alone,

61
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,530
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

62
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,310
you were willing to backstab me for.

63
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,710
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

64
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,050
Q!

65
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,750
Oh, good.

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,080
Hey, I don't know if it was just,
like, a super anxious rabbit,

67
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,300
but your message made
things seem kinda...

68
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,320
Dire? They are.

69
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,990
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,420
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Poppy.

71
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,990
I'm helping Quentin find the next key.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,280
- No, she's not helping me. We're...
- Okay, can we hit pause on the recap

73
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,219
until we're back
where our pasty usurpers

74
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,830
won't kill us all?

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,680
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,950
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

77
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,020
Alice, can you hear me?

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,360
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,700
I told you, I'm fine.

80
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,030
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,300
I expected this, okay?

82
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,570
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

83
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,670
There are occasional surges.

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,040
That's all this was.

85
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,340
I mean, was that all this was? A surge?

86
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,650
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

87
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,650
of organ transplant protection.

88
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,980
Attacking itself to get
rid of the invader.

89
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,990
Or maybe it's nothing at all. Who knows?

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,190
Who knows?

91
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,940
Well, we need a better answer than that.

92
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,110
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,880
I have no idea what's going to happen.

94
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,450
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

95
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,880
Energy-balancing spells, exercises...

96
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,580
I suppose that could work.

97
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,550
Your confidence is overwhelming.

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,260
What's the point of lying?

99
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,100
You people are just going to do
what you do, regardless...

100
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,890
Q.

101
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,070
Okay, you go get the key, I got this.

102
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,740
No, I'm gonna stay here and help.

103
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,110
I don't think more is merrier here.

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,580
I don't know... didn't you notice
your ex is a little...

105
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,080
Stubborn.

106
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,020
I noticed.

107
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,580
Alice and I got into this together.

108
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,490
I'll get us out, one way or another.

109
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,820
And I will make sure that she's okay.

110
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,860
Okay?

111
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,330
Go get the key while you still can.

112
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,100
We're all kinda counting on you
to bring back all of magic.

113
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,300
So you lost your key in the Underworld

114
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,270
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,940
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

116
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,440
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

117
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm an astral projection.

118
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,450
No offense, but your corpse is ash,

119
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,950
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

120
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,850
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

121
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,120
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

122
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,210
Yeah.

123
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,860
And I burned my body to avoid that.

124
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,990
Look, if we do not get to the Underworld

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,130
before Benedict moves on...
whatever that means...

126
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,730
then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

127
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,900
That's not my problem.

128
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,970
No magic is everyone's problem.

129
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,540
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

130
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,030
Especially to you?

131
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,090
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

132
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,480
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

133
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,810
is at stake.

134
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,660
Fine. I'll help.

135
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,820
But it's not like I can
just Travel to the Underworld.

136
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,490
So we need a gatekeeper.

137
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,060
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

138
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,590
What about the Library's dragon?

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.

140
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,360
At least one side of the convo, anyway.

141
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,100
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,770
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

143
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,640
I read about it during dissertation
research. I assume it's real.

144
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,180
Ask your invisible friend.

145
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,180
Yeah, apparently.

146
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,460
I hear they use it to send

147
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,050
books to and from the Underworld.

148
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,450
'Cause dragons are portals, right?

149
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,680
Yeah, exact... ha...
the Bookwyrm's too small

150
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,720
to send a full-size person down there.

151
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,400
Well, what if the person was a book?

152
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,130
Well, you said you can project
into objects, right?

153
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,360
Yeah, I did... did say that, didn't I?

154
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,260
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

155
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,740
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

156
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,370
it's stuck in the Satellite Library,

157
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,110
which is on another planet, so...

158
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,240
So, we need another Traveler.

159
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,710
- Um.
- Oh.

160
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,080
I only know one.

161
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,150
And she got grabbed by
the Beast in Fillory.

162
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,080
Victoria, she was in my class.

163
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,780
Wait a minute, you know Victoria?

164
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,720
Of course you know her, you... um...

165
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,390
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

166
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,220
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

167
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,590
I have no idea where she is.

168
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,060
If she's on Earth, I can find her.

169
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,560
On one condition... I wanna come.

170
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,800
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

171
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,830
This could be my only shot.

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,800
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

173
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,810
This doesn't make us friends, you know.

174
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,480
Discover anything useful for Alice?

175
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,580
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

176
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,120
on combining immunosuppressants

177
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,750
with a crystal-based healing ritual.

178
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,190
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

179
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,290
Not long ago, you wanted magic so badly

180
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,200
you fought through a memory wipe.

181
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,540
And now...

182
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,100
It's complicated. Uh... and personal.

183
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,700
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled Millennial bullshit."

184
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,810
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

185
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,940
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

186
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,040
You don't know that.

187
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,540
I know a lot more than you.

188
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,280
You're drunk, and you're mean.

189
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,120
And I'm right.

190
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,820
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

191
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,790
It doesn't fit Alice.

192
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,290
If she keeps it, she'll die.

193
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,720
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

194
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,230
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,940
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

196
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,670
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

197
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,670
Alice has it all. She'll never do it.

198
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,290
Well, fine. Go get some.

199
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,590
Oh, sure, I'll just pop over
to the store.

200
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,290
Actually, I think I may know someone

201
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,200
who may be of assistance.

202
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,200
But given their naked opportunism,

203
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,400
I can't imagine it'll come free.

204
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,620
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

205
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,200
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

206
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,580
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

207
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,930
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

208
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,660
We had the most wonderful adventure.

209
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,530
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

210
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,700
And it's always light.

211
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,500
A man urinated next to me.

212
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,000
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broad Way.

213
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,110
You call it "Cats," but it's
just humans in cat greasepaint.

214
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,010
And we tried a delicacy called pizza

215
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,250
at an eatery that was "Family Style."

216
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,450
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

217
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,680
Hi, Todd.

218
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,120
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

219
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,920
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy anything at all?

220
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,630
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

221
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,460
I do want you to like things, you know.

222
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,430
I can tell you want to be a good father.

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,040
It's sort of sweet.

224
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,040
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

225
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,470
- With time.
- Oh.

226
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,910
Let's go with that.

227
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
Not to interrupt this Hallmark moment,

228
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,490
but Todd, you got a sec?

229
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,390
Yeah.

230
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,620
Wait, fairies are real?

231
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,720
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought Fray was just nuts.

232
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,560
I mean, she is, but yeah,

233
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,160
they're real and they're raging dicks,

234
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,090
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

235
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,900
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

236
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,550
Just make sure Fray doesn't see 'em,

237
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,070
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

238
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,510
I've got another job for you.

239
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

240
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,280
What's with the feathers?

241
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,980
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

242
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,750
- to the Fairy Queen.
- Mmm...

243
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,740
Okay. As long as she bought it.

244
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,040
Everyone in the castle did.

245
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,290
Even Prince Fomar
and the Stone Queen headed back

246
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,690
to their mountain/island.

247
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,090
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

248
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,600
Well, that's good news, right?

249
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,930
So what's with the face?

250
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,420
Well, this just took a dark turn.

251
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,940
In exchange for my babies,
you want... my bathtub?

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,290
You collect toes and eyeballs,

253
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,600
and you think that's weird?

254
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,230
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

255
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,760
curious act of extortion.

256
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,700
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

257
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,300
on the side of the road.

258
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,370
We thought you'd be alarmed by that too,

259
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,140
given you forced us into that alliance.

260
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,880
So what's it gonna be? Your bathtub?

261
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,310
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

262
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,950
It's a strange deal.

263
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,270
Even for me.

264
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
Right.

265
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,450
I should be more specific.

266
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,890
You're giving your bathtub

267
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,390
to the entire population of Fillory.

268
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,060
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

269
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,500
It'll be fun.

270
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,700
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

271
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,000
everyone will then be able to see us.

272
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,670
I suppose you're right.

273
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,310
No more shadow-puppeting.

274
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,210
Just straight-up puppeting, from now on.

275
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,540
Or hey, you could leave.

276
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,980
There is another option, you know.

277
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,850
I find my children, and then...

278
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,350
You have till tomorrow.

279
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,490
So have fun on the little egg hunt,

280
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,990
'cause if you don't make this deal,

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
we're about to boil and dye 'em

282
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,590
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

283
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,540
I don't know what that means.

284
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,330
So, if I understand you correctly,

285
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,100
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

286
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,870
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

287
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,370
Because I need your help.

288
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,040
Well, why should I trust you now?

289
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,370
You've already lied to me once.

290
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,210
She's lied to me several times too.

291
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,350
So at least you know it's not personal.

292
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,750
Like it wasn't personal

293
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,220
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

294
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,550
without so much as texting me first.

295
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,220
Henry, trust me, better me than them.

296
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,880
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

297
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,360
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

298
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,760
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

299
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,460
Limited reserves.

300
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,800
I just need a little bit.

301
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,230
I gave what I had to a friend.

302
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,240
- Why the hell would you do that?
- But it is killing her.

303
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,580
So without your help, she will
die and so will the magic.

304
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,420
All right.

305
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,760
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

306
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,250
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

307
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,990
You knew about this?

308
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,320
I thought I was very clear

309
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,460
about not looking in the cubbyhole.

310
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,760
You were. That's why I looked.

311
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,780
Fray, what are those?

312
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,040
Fairy eggs. That Father and Margo took.

313
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,810
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

314
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,300
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

315
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,800
The Fairy Queen stole you from us.

316
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,410
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

317
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,010
It was a fair deal.
This... is kidnapping.

318
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,420
Unlike you, we have honor.

319
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,450
You're not a fairy, Fray.

320
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,990
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

321
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,260
as anything but a human?

322
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,760
Because she won't.

323
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,290
That's not true.

324
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,430
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

325
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,300
That's pretty cold.

326
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,800
Humans are complicated.

327
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,270
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

328
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,970
Yeah, like, I once donated a kidney

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,340
to this girl I really liked.

330
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,880
Only, it turned out she didn't actually

331
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,510
need it for a transplant.

332
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,820
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

333
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,160
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

334
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,500
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

335
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,170
Family is about loyalty, my love.

336
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,810
Fuck you!

337
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,340
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

338
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,150
She slept with Josh.

339
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,940
On our Fillorian spring break.

340
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,180
While he and I were still dating.

341
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,050
Are you really still upset about Josh?

342
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,080
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

343
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,020
Yeah, do you not get that

344
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,390
that only makes it more fucked up?

345
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,060
Sorry, could we just focus for a second?

346
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,660
It's just kind of important.

347
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,020
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

348
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,230
I still wouldn't help you.

349
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,860
'Cause I don't trust you.

350
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,610
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

351
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,510
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

352
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,800
I know. It's just not that simple, okay?

353
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,300
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

354
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,550
Group?

355
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,450
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

356
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,550
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

357
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,050
It's just... we got something going on.

358
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,020
Wait, is your boss, um...

359
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,860
is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

360
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,030
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriett person,

361
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,400
can... can you get her to help?

362
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,100
Uh, she doesn't exactly

363
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,740
- like me.
- Great.

364
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,270
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

365
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,970
So it makes perfect sense.

366
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,110
Some people are just so emotional.

367
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,750
Harriet does like Kady, though.

368
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,820
Okay, great, then let's talk to Kady.

369
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,250
Where is she?

370
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,800
Shit.

371
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,440
Kady.

372
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,730
All right, I can help you.

373
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,100
But you'll owe me a favor.

374
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,100
Uh, what's the favor?

375
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,270
To be determined.

376
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,570
- Trust her.
- What could go wrong?

377
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,840
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

378
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,410
It was buy the place

379
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,670
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

380
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,180
and turn this place into a...
an amusement park.

381
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,410
At least I care.

382
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,620
You care about something.

383
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,860
Do we have a deal?

384
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,090
Is that cocaine?

385
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,430
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

386
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,130
But yes, you will have to snort it.

387
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm sorry, what creature?

388
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,700
I thought you had batteries.

389
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,440
Look, you asked me for my help.

390
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,510
This is what I have to offer.

391
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,280
Okay, Kady is in the High Risk Ward,

392
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,610
down the hallway over here.

393
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,080
The ward is locked. So is Kady's room.

394
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,910
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

395
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,750
Okay.

396
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,390
Those squiggles are guards?

397
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

398
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,690
Gotcha.

399
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,720
So, how are we gonna get in
past all the security?

400
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,560
We're not.
They are gonna bring her to us.

401
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,180
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

402
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,900
- for more than 15 days...
- They have to bring in

403
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,070
outside doctors to certify she's crazy.

404
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,370
Yeah, and, uh, we will be those doctors.

405
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,740
They'll buy that?

406
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,670
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

407
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,090
No, it's like a state hospital.

408
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,040
Yeah, their computer systems
are older than we are.

409
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,180
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

410
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
Good thinking.

411
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,070
Should I be concerned that you
both know so much about this?

412
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,950
Mm... There was a "crazy" time.

413
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,540
Okay, whatever, uh...

414
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,810
But it's not like you two can just
walk out of there with a patient.

415
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,480
No, but Kady can walk herself out

416
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,390
if she has a security badge.

417
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,020
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

418
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,830
No, I will.

419
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,570
Here we are.

420
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,270
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr....

421
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,610
Kline. Midtown Mental Health Clinic.

422
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,010
Which is where we work.

423
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,080
Yes. We're here to do an evaluation.

424
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,620
Great. Mind if I sit in?

425
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,630
No, not at all. Please do.

426
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,260
Okay, um, so, Kady, um...

427
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,470
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

428
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,400
from delusions, and that you've
been talking to someone

429
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,720
named, uh... Penny?

430
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,550
Oh, um, yeah.

431
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,250
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

432
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,580
We're breaking you out of here.

433
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,750
Kady, can you tell us about Penny?

434
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,030
Yeah, uh, yeah, he was a... my ex.

435
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,860
But I-I don't see him anymore.

436
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,730
Quentin's gonna hand you
a security badge.

437
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,300
It'll get you out of the ward.

438
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,030
When you're on break, in the day room,

439
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,040
use it to sneak out. We'll be waiting.

440
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,480
Oh, someone has lost their badge.

441
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,280
Great.

442
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,780
What now?

443
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,620
What if she doesn't take the deal?

444
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,620
Then what do we do? Or, no...

445
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,220
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

446
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,460
Stop it.

447
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,260
It's going to be fine.

448
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,220
We could cut our losses.

449
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,990
We could head back to Earth and regroup.

450
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,760
We could finish the quest,
restore magic,

451
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,500
and then maybe revisit this

452
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,170
when we stand a fighting chance.

453
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,200
You and I both sacrificed
a lot for Fillory.

454
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,710
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

455
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,850
to the albino supermodel?

456
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,780
Bitch took my eye.

457
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,780
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

458
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,290
But what if we're making things worse?

459
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,190
There wasn't a blood test to
tell me to be High Queen.

460
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,300
I chose it.

461
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,430
And I have had to fight for
every shred of authority.

462
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,100
And no offense,

463
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,770
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

464
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,270
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

465
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,610
Those fairy bitches wanna come
for my crown, well...

466
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,060
I'll shove it up their fucking eggholes.

467
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,650
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

468
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,590
I'm on board.

469
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,560
Maybe try the key.

470
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,700
- What?
- Well, I don't know.

471
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,800
Like, wave it around or something.

472
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,730
Maybe a keyhole will appear in the wall.

473
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,800
This is stupid.

474
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,470
And I feel sick.

475
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,970
Why are you here anyway?

476
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,940
We already stuck a fork in this, Penny.

477
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,310
- We're helping you.
- All of a sudden?

478
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,920
After I was such a ray
of sunshine to you last time.

479
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,680
We need you to talk to Harriet.

480
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,450
We need her help getting the next key,

481
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,190
so we can bring magic back.

482
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,290
All right. And where's the next key?

483
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,660
In the Underworld.

484
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,370
I'm the only one who can get it, Kady.

485
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,000
You're doing it again, aren't you?

486
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,240
Throwing your life
at a problem to solve it.

487
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,980
I'm tired, Penny.

488
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,810
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

489
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,510
I thought we weren't a couple.

490
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,380
That's not funny.

491
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,060
It's a little funny.

492
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,950
Hey, yell at me.

493
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,820
I don't want to. I am tired of yelling.

494
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,780
Yell at me.

495
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,660
I'm getting you out of this room.

496
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,160
Come on!

497
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,030
Aah!

498
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Aah!

499
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,970
Aah!

500
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,710
Okay, Kady.

501
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,710
Hand over the contraband.

502
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,260
What's up?

503
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,560
Uhh...

504
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,550
Go, team.

505
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,920
Alice, what're you doing here?

506
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,590
What are you?

507
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,770
I thought you were in a psych ward.

508
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,990
I was.

509
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,500
Now I'm the sanest woman in America.

510
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,960
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

511
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,230
I actually can't really feel anything.

512
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,740
It's fantastic.

513
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,040
If I didn't know better, I would say

514
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,610
that you were just trying to cast

515
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,540
an intermediate unlocking charm.

516
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,540
That would mean that I have magic,

517
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,550
which we both know is impossible.

518
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,110
Right. Hmm.

519
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,050
Well, don't bother.
I already looted the place.

520
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,250
Brakebills may be closed.
Black market's not.

521
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,020
Gotta make a living.

522
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,720
You, uh, looking for something special?

523
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,460
Some Boswellia.

524
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,860
Bloodstone, steroids.

525
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,530
Fuck me.

526
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,970
So you do have magic.

527
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,070
What do you know about transplants?

528
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
I know you'd have to be desperate

529
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,910
to try something that stupid.

530
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,810
Well, who am I to judge?

531
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,220
I almost blew a werewolf
so he'd turn me.

532
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,310
Magical creatures...

533
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,760
they can hang on to their magic
just fine, so...

534
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,090
Please...

535
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,790
if you have anything that can help me...

536
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,460
Well, Boswellia and
Bloodstone are total bullshit.

537
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,930
But, uh, steroids might help a little.

538
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,400
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

539
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,240
It says take two. You should take eight.

540
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,600
- Thank you.
- We're all screwed anyway.

541
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,880
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, hmm?

542
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,480
Dr. Bailey,

543
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,480
you're needed at nurse's station 204.

544
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,860
- Dr. Bailey...
- Nurse coming. Shh!

545
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,630
I know you don't wanna talk right now.

546
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,130
- I sure don't.
- Yeah, yeah, hate me later.

547
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,100
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

548
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,130
You're the best thing in my life.

549
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,540
Short life, granted, but...

550
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,810
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

551
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,970
Well, you should.

552
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,810
It's crazy we lived this long.

553
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,040
We met. We had great sex.

554
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,090
I got to know you.

555
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,020
I'm lucky.

556
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,650
What's your point?

557
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,650
Don't be mad too long.

558
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
I want you to be happy.

559
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,490
Jesus Christ.

560
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,730
I can't be.

561
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,500
Without you, you fucking idiot.

562
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,990
But isn't that just adult life?

563
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,340
Accepting your own misery.

564
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,540
Code Green,

565
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,170
Shit. I guess they found my room.

566
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,680
Come on.

567
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,330
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

568
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,380
and the key locked up in there...

569
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,820
I know, I know. Quit being so twitchy.

570
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,080
You look suspicious.

571
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,020
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

572
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,490
Attention, this is a Code Green.

573
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,590
- Everyone stay in their room.
- Oh, shit. Lockdown.

574
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,060
And stay calm. We are on lockdown.

575
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,390
We're gonna have to help her...

576
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,640
Attention, this is a Code Green.

577
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,530
You sure this is gonna work?

578
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,900
It's fire safety protocol.

579
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,070
How do you not know that?

580
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,080
Attention, please proceed
to the nearest fire exit

581
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,110
and evacuate immediately.
See? Works every time.

582
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,950
How many times have you done this?

583
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,350
And evacuate immediately.

584
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,880
Keep it moving!

585
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,020
I told you we'd figure it out.

586
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,540
Oh, shit.

587
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,220
Come on, let's go.

588
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,950
Well.

589
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,980
Alice is gone.

590
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,150
Might be time to use this.

591
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,830
To cast a locator spell.

592
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,130
Ugh.

593
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,160
Reminds me of the old days.

594
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,530
I don't wanna know.

595
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,540
This magic... it looks different.

596
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,170
It feels different.

597
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,680
If it's working, let's not split hairs.

598
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,410
Find her.

599
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,220
Wait a minute. What's Alice doing there?

600
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,860
I'm blind. Are you going to tell me?

601
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,180
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

602
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,130
She was upset and tried to take them.

603
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,700
I stopped her, but she ran away
and we can't find her.

604
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,100
This is not good.

605
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,630
And real bad timing, El.

606
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

607
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,540
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

608
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,070
we need to put a pin in it. There's
nothing we can do about it right now.

609
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,150
- Perhaps I can help.
- Oh, Fray.

610
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,810
We've been having quite a talk.

611
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,450
Eggs and portals and quests.

612
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,690
So much going on I didn't know about.

613
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,840
We really should discuss.

614
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,400
Crap.

615
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,120
Fray? How could you?

616
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,870
Like you said, family loyalty.

617
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,240
I've considered your offer.

618
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,300
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

619
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,430
I won't hurt yours.

620
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,700
Wait. What?

621
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,720
- No.
- Don't you touch her.

622
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,660
But my Queen...

623
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,680
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

624
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,780
- No one needs to get hurt.
- I agree.

625
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,310
I... I helped you. I...

626
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,890
Yes.

627
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,270
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

628
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,440
Betrayed your own parents.

629
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,530
Why would I ever trust you?

630
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,840
I just... found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

631
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,470
I just wanted all this to stop.

632
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,170
So let's stop this.

633
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,650
We gotta give her the eggs.

634
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,220
There's gotta be another way.
That's our only leverage.

635
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,490
I know, but she's my daughter.

636
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,520
We have a whole country to think about.

637
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,670
I can't be the dad that turns
his back on his kid.

638
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,830
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

639
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,170
- What're you saying?
- What?

640
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,520
Explain.

641
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,270
Now...

642
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,010
or it's poached eggs tonight.

643
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,520
Fray isn't yours.

644
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,350
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

645
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,810
She died?

646
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,480
Oh, gods, I...

647
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Oh, no. Oh, no.

648
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,210
That is the sound
of your leverage dying.

649
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,300
You'd better shake on this deal
while you still can.

650
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,020
No, no way.

651
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,770
- Please.
- No.

652
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm asking for this favor.

653
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,790
Okay, okay, look.

654
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,360
Look, I'm... I am grateful for
everything you did for me.

655
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,130
For Penny.

656
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,570
So how about this?

657
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,870
What if...

658
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,480
Then we both get what we want.

659
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,660
So we're gonna rob the Library?

660
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,220
- Oh, awesome.
- No, not awesome.

661
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,390
Stupid.

662
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,960
It is hard enough
to sneak one person in there.

663
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,000
How the hell are they gonna
get the whole group in?

664
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,470
It's the dumbest plan I've ever...

665
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,470
Uhh...

666
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,680
Uh, Penny's got some notes.

667
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,810
You said you wanted to do this.

668
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,120
You don't know
the defenses this place has.

669
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,020
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

670
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,230
Oh, are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

671
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,530
You've been waiting to say that.

672
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,650
I know what I'm doing.

673
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,690
My head's clear now.

674
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,820
You got me out. We'll get the key out.

675
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,830
You just... you have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

676
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,180
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

677
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,430
Being on the astral plane's great.

678
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,740
Just a little over being stuck here.

679
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,840
Bringing magic back is
the only way I see out of this.

680
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,480
Wouldn't it be funny
if we made it out of this?

681
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,650
I'd laugh pretty hard.

682
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,120
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

683
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,590
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

684
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah, I heard that one before.

685
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,920
I love you.

686
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,570
I'm sorry we're cursed.

687
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,820
He's gone.

688
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,860
What, like, gone? Gone gone? Like...

689
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,240
Like, to the Library gone?

690
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,990
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

691
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,540
So let's not fuck it up on our end.

692
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,790
Are you sure you wanna do this?

693
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,830
It's not exactly like everyone thinks...

694
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,760
Jonesing for blood.

695
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,800
Watching everyone you know die.

696
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,130
That is, if you
don't kill them yourself.

697
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,970
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

698
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,040
You seem... smart.
Too smart to want all this.

699
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,610
I don't want it.

700
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,480
- Then why...
- It's none of your business.

701
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,550
Well, then, no.

702
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,740
Becoming a creature...
no offense... is the only way

703
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,420
I can keep my magic.

704
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,030
Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

705
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,240
I'm not. But are you so sure

706
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,560
this'll do what you want it to?

707
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,230
No, but I'm out of options,

708
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,100
so will you take my money or not?

709
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,170
All right.

710
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,840
Alice, let's go.

711
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,250
Jesus, how did you find me?

712
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,950
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

713
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,080
All I found were shitty vampires.

714
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,620
Can we please go?

715
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,760
No, just leave. Continue.

716
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,260
Ah!

717
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,830
Leave or I break it.

718
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,330
Ah! Get off me!

719
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,100
How did you do that?

720
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,130
Ah. Get out.

721
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,600
No, I gave you my money.

722
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,440
Not enough to deal with
hedgewitch Buffy. Good luck.

723
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,950
Out!

724
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,380
When we said we'd explore our options,

725
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,210
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

726
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,610
I researched. This is the only way.

727
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,820
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

728
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,130
Okay. I don't need your help,
you condescending bitch.

729
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,470
Aaaaaah!

730
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,340
Oh, no, Julia.

731
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,120
I transferred it all back.

732
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,020
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,790
All you did was try to help me,
and I almost killed you.

734
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,700
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

735
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,960
I guess we're even.

736
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,170
We're not,
but that's nice of you to say.

737
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,910
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

738
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,540
I mean, what do people in limbo do?

739
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,850
It's excruciating.

740
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,180
You know, and I just thought
maybe if I could just...

741
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,460
Fix it?

742
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,460
I know the feeling.

743
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,870
Really.

744
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,760
I still see Reynard.

745
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,170
You do?

746
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,910
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

747
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,070
Do you think maybe it's because...

748
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,410
I think it's because it happened.

749
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,090
And there's nothing magic
about it anymore.

750
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,910
When things happen, they leave a mark.

751
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,090
Figuring out how to deal
with it takes time.

752
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,960
I get what Quentin always saw in you.

753
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,930
You're brave.

754
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,990
Just stubborn.

755
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,960
I think that's why you can hold it.

756
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,100
All the pain, and all the shit
you didn't ask for,

757
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,740
that's what made you you.

758
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,740
And that's why this magic fits.

759
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,310
Maybe sometimes life is... random

760
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,840
and unfair.

761
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,110
You know, it doesn't always
ask our permission.

762
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,220
It just is.

763
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,860
Honestly...

764
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,470
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

765
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,100
Except that it's not his anymore, Julia.

766
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,070
I felt it. It... it's yours.

767
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,140
For whatever reason.

768
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,380
So what are you gonna do with it?

769
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,300
Fen.

770
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,380
Maybe you shouldn't be holding
sharp objects right now.

771
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,210
My father was a knife maker.

772
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,490
This is how I've always calmed down.

773
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,510
When our daughter was born,

774
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,310
they took her away.

775
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,460
They wouldn't let me hold her.
I never heard her cry.

776
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,220
I should have known.

777
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,360
How could I not know?

778
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,660
God, I was so ready to believe Fray.

779
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,330
I think deep down I thought...

780
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,810
If we just felt like a family,

781
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,380
if I just willed it hard enough,

782
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,110
then that would be real.

783
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,620
'Cause this...

784
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,680
How am I supposed to live with it?

785
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,790
Oh, God.

786
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,420
God, oh, Fen, I'm so sorry.

787
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,530
You would've been... um.

788
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,900
No, you were such a great mom.

789
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,780
And... I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

790
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,730
You deserve so much better than this.

791
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,620
I'm gonna need some time.

792
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,550
I can't be in Fillory right now.

793
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,020
Okay, okay.

794
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,490
Hey.

795
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,330
Okay, dude. Spill.

796
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,640
What's up?

797
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,610
What if... Penny doesn't find Benedict

798
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,760
or the Key? Or he gets caught
by a Librarian, or we do,

799
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,740
or any part
of this ridiculous plan fails?

800
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,220
It seems like you're worrying
about a lot of stuff

801
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,590
you can't control, here.

802
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,590
Everything that we're doing,
if we mess it up,

803
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,440
it's not just me who suffers.

804
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,760
It's not just us who suffers.

805
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,730
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

806
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,400
No, it's not the multiverse.

807
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,340
Magic doesn't exist in this universe.

808
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,340
It doesn't mean it's gone
in alternate realities.

809
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,520
- That is not the point.
- Oh, boy.

810
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,020
What're you doing?

811
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,790
Short-circuiting your panic attack.

812
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,930
It's getting tiresome.

813
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,290
Okay, I'm confused.

814
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,630
It's sweet how much you care
about your friends.

815
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,600
Even the ones that don't like you.

816
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,270
Let's just have some fun.

817
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,940
Seems like the chances of
everyone surviving

818
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,940
go up if we do that.

819
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,480
Hmm?

820
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,160
Your eggs, I take it, are fine?

821
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,270
Yes.

822
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,510
What have you done with Fray?

823
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,840
She did not want to return with me.

824
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,440
Her fate is her own.

825
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,000
Is the rest done?

826
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,670
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

827
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,570
May they be clean forever.

828
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,540
I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift.

829
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,210
While we're at it.

830
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,710
What was your end game anyway?

831
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,080
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

832
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,520
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world

833
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,550
domination mega-villain" bullshit?

834
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,890
It's a sign of your human privilege

835
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,290
that you see things so simply.

836
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,360
Oh, but it is simple, Lady...
you made us look crazy.

837
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,270
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

838
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,100
But now everyone will understand

839
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,240
what was really happening to us.

840
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,570
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

841
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,780
Everyone can see you now.

842
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,280
True. And they can see you too.

843
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,420
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

844
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,390
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

845
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,890
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

846
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,560
for some time.

847
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,490
I can no longer help you.

848
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,330
Help us with what?

849
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,430
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

850
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,500
a little too "Les Miz" for my liking.

851
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,740
- Okay, Bambi? They're armed.
- Ah!

852
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,910
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

853
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,880
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

854
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,710
Ohh...

855
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,420
Hold on! Hold on!

856
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,080
Aah! Aah!

857
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,330
I'm your Queen, you motherfuckers!
