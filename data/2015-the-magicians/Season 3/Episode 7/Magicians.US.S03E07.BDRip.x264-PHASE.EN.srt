Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,448
At your service.
You're from Brakebills?

<i>PENNY: I'll go to Fillory
on one condition.</i>

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,180
That girl you saw in the
dungeon, we'll get her out.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,451
Victoria.

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,652
You found me.

9
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:15,853
Look, I’m here.

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,360
No, I have to put myself
back together.

11
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,862
I need to sign out.

12
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,193
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

13
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,528
No.

14
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,227
The fairies aren't
just terraforming,

15
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,167
they're growing an army.

bigger than</i>

17
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,198
just assassinating the Queen.
We need...

18
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,832
Hostages, leverage.
Don't ask questions.

19
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,900
Did you get the key?
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,173
I'm a terrible failure.
Benedict, no!

21

<i>POPPY: They don't just make portals.
They are perms.</i>

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,913
The key way
to the Underworld.

23
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,047
It's magic. I'd do
anything to get it back.

24
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,216
If I could give it to you,
I would.

25

26
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,387
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

27
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,896
God! Alice!

28
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,900
Okay, someone's gotta
hear this, please.

29
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,272
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

30
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,741
The little weirdo
wouldn't go to sleep

31
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,209
until I read him
a bedtime story.

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,406
That's disturbing.
Let's hustle.

33
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,346
Q's probably already
at the tree.

34
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,782
Tick, how are we doing?

35
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,251
Five minutes till the fairy
guards change shifts,

36
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,582
Your Majesties.

37
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,851
Now, no one knows
we're gone, okay?

38
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,085
If the Fairy Queen asks,

39
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,422
we're bedridden
with something contagious.

40
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,757
Like chicken pox.

41
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,421
Certainly, Highness.
But must you leave?

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,057
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat difficult.

43
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,227
What do you mean?
It seems your union

44
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,100
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

45
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,433
that this land is now theirs.

46
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,475
They've been, well,
pillaging a lot.

47
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,601
I thought perhaps
a royal address...

48
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,111
MARGO:
You're thinking too small.

49
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,704
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,613
Extortion.
Exactly!

51
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,277
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

52
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,286
But we can't deal
with the Floaters

53
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,153
until we deal
with the Fairies, got it?

54

paid the Hudson River dragon

55
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,296
to send you
to the Underworld.

56
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,455
That is so cool.

57
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,089
QUENTIN: Yeah, well,
it was a one-off.

58
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,930
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

59
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,062
I hear
she's kinda withholding.

60
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,571
And judge-y.

61
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,073
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able

62
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,166
to help us?
There's no "us."

63
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,971
I'm gonna go talk
to Penny alone,

64
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,477
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

65
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,309

to backstab me for.

66
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,748

some hostility here, and...

00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,080
ELIOT: Q!

68
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,779
QUENTIN: Oh, good.

69
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,120
Hey, I don't know if it was just,
like, a super anxious rabbit,

70
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,022
but your message made
things seem kinda...

71
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,321
Dire? They are.

72
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,986
Are those supplies?
MARGO: Hostages.

73
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,428
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Poppy.

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,999

find the next key.

75
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,692
No, she's not helping me.
We're...

76
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,996
Okay, can we hit pause
on the recap

77
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,832

78
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,837

87
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,697
I told you, I'm fine.

88
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,707
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

89
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,209
I expected this, okay?

90
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,007
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

91
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,571
There are occasional surges.

92
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,979
That's all this was.

93
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,246
I mean, was that all
this was? A surge?

94
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,550
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

95
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,556
of organ
transplant projection.

00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,719

rid of the invader.

00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,986
Who knows?

Well, we need
a better answer than that.

what's going to happen.

for this, okay?

Stubborn.

114
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,303

that she's okay.

00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:33,943
Okay?

119
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,747
Go get the key
while you still can.

120
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,482
We're all kinda
counting on you

121
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,783
to bring back all of magic.

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,252
Yeah.

123
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,158
So you lost your key
in the Underworld

124
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,289
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

125
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,798
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

126
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,303
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

127
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,770
I'm an astral projection.

128
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,298
No offense,
but your corpse is ash,

129
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,805
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

130
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,746
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

131
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,978
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

132
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,177
Yeah.

133
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,754
And I burned my body
to avoid that.

134
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,854
Look, if we do not get
to the Underworld

135
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,983
before Benedict moves on...
Whatever that means...

136
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,626
Then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

137
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,788
That's not my problem.

138
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,832
No magic
is everyone's problem.

139
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,435
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

140
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,993
Especially to you?

141
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,696
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

142
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,331
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

143
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,000
is at stake.

144
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,610
Fine. I'll help.

145
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,681
But it's not like I can
just travel to the Underworld.

146
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,342
So we need a gatekeeper.

147
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,943
A dragon,
like Jules and I used.

148
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,486
What about
the Library's dragon?

149
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,456
Sorry, couldn't help but
overhear.

150
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,221
At least one side
of the convo, anyway.

151
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,989
The Library has a dragon?
Mmm-hmm.

152
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,362
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

153
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,159
I read about it during
dissertation research.

154
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,136
I assume it's real.
Ask your invisible friend.

155
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,038
Yeah, apparently.

156
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,505
I hear they use it to send

157
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,906
books to and from
the Underworld.

158
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,341
'Cause dragons are portals,
right?

159
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,545
Yeah, except...
The Bookwyrm's too small

160
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,582
to send a full-size person
down there.

161
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,345
Well, what if
the person was a book?

162
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,013
Well, you said you can
project into objects, right?

163
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,218
Yeah, I did...
Did say that, didn't I?

164
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,158
Jesus Christ.
Okay, so this might work.

165
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,359
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

166
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,228
lt's stuck in
the Satellite Library,

167
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,996
which is on another planet,
so...

168
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,006
So, we need
another Traveler.

169
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,934
Oh, I only know one.

170
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,205
And she got grabbed by
The Beast in Fillory.

171
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,836
(SIGHS) Victoria,
she was in my class.

172
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,674
Wait a minute,
you know Victoria?

173
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,581
Of course
you know her, you...

174
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,243
Wait, wait.
She's not dead?

175
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,083
No, I mean' we saved her
and she sorta took off.

176
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,451
I have no idea
where she is.

177
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,388
If she's on Earth,
I can find her.

178
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,222
On one condition.
I wanna come.

179
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,686
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

180
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,130
This could be my only shot.

181
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,734
All right, fine.
(WHISPERS) Oh, yes!

182
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,632
This doesn't make us friends,
you know.

183
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,366
DEAN: Discover anything
useful for Alice?

184
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,440
Urn, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

185
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,210
on combining
immunosuppressants

186
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,616
with a crystal-based
healing ritual.

187
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,551
(LAUGHS)

188
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,953
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

189
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,155
Not long ago,
you wanted magic so badly

190
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,092
you fought through
a memory wipe.

191
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,152
And now...

192
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,155
It's complicated
and personal.

193
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,600
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled millennial bullshit."

194
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,501
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

195
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,801
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

196
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,931
You don't know that

197
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,442
I know a lot more than you.

198
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,136
You're drunk,
and you're mean.

199
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,576
And I'm right.

200
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,308
(SIGHS)

201
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,680
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

202
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,252
It doesn't fit Alice.

203
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,153
If she keeps it, she'll die.

204
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,621
So what do I do'?
Take it back.

205
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,192
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

206
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,489
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

207
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,529
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

208
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,532
Alice has it all.
Shell never do it.

209
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,128
Well, fine. Go get some.

210
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,433
Oh, sure, I'll just
pop over to the store.

211
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,137
Actually, I think
I may know someone

212
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,009
who may be of assistance.

213
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,013
But given
their naked opportunism,

214
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,209
I can't imagine
it'll come free.

215
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,217
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

216
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,015
Tick's a crafty
son of a bitch.

217
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,488
He's got us covered.
Okay.

218
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,555
Eliot.
Hey, guys.

219
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,829
We had the most wonderful
adventure.

220
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,388
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

221
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,558
And it's always light.

222
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,657
A man urinated next to me.

223
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,295
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broadway.

224
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,170
You call it <i>Cars,</i> but it's just
humans in cat greasepaint.

225
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,867
And we tried a delicacy
called pizza

226
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:57,312
at an eatery that was
"Family Style."

227
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,341
Well, lam so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

228
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,546
Hi, Todd.

229
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,019
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

230
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,816
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy
anything at all?

231
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,325
Earth?
Or the Square of Time?

232
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,354
I do want you
to like things, you know.

233
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,197
I can tell you want
to be a good father.

234
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,226
It's sort of sweet.

235
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,605
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

236
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,902
With time.
Oh!

237
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,911
Let's go with that.

238
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,040
Not to interrupt
this Hallmark moment,

239
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,174
but Todd, you got a sec?

240
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,343
Yeah.

241
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,518
Wait, fairies are real?

242
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,586
Mmm-hmm. I thought
Fray was just nuts.

243
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,422
I mean, she is,
but, yeah,

244
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,052
they're real
and they're raging dicks,

245
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,756
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

246
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,767
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

247
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,200
Just make sure
Fray doesn't see 'em,

248
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,932
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

249
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,235
I've got another job for you.

250
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,111
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

251
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,971
ELIOT:
What's with the feathers?

252
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,883
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

253
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,145
to the Fairy Queen.

254
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,449
Okay. As long
as she bought it.

255
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,954
Everyone
in the castle did.

256
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,150
Even Prince Fomar and
the Stone Queen headed back

257
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,921
to their mountain/island.

258
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,963
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

259
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,759
Well, that's good news, right?

260
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,125
So what's with the face?

261
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,569
(FLIES BUZZING)

262
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,242
Well, this
just took a dark turn.

263
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,591
In exchange for my babies,
you want my bathtub?

264
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,427
You collect toes and eyeballs,
and you think that's weird?

265
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,994
You'll pardon me, but I'm a bit
taken aback by this sudden

266
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,795
curious act of extortion.

267
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,603
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

268
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,832
on the side of the road.

269
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,538
MARGO: We thought you'd
be alarmed by that too,

270
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,141
given you forced us
into that alliance.

271
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,140
So what's it gonna be?
Your bathtub?

272
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,981
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

273
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,355
It's a strange deal.

274
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,221
Even for me.
MARGO: Right.

275
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,652
I should be more specific.

276
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,794
You're giving your bathtub

277
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,297
to the entire population
of Fillory.

278
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,830
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

279
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,362
It'll be fun.

280
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,298
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

281
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,637
everyone will then
be able to see us.

282
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,535
I suppose you're right.

283
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,169
ELIOT:
No more shadow-puppeting.

284
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,079
Just straight-up puppeting,
from now on.

285
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,412
Or hey, you could leave.

286
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,350
FAIRY QUEEN: There is
another option, you know.

287
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,719
I find my children,
and then...

288
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,223
You have till tomorrow.

289
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,356
So have fun
on the little egg hum,

290
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,861
'cause if you don't
make this deal,

291
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,191
we're about to boil
and dye 'em

292
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,732
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

293
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,890
I don’t know
what that means.

294
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,195
So, if I understand you
correctly,

295
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,072
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

296
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,737
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

297
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,240
Because I need your help.

298
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,906
Well, why should I
trust you now?

299
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,244
You've already
lied to me once.

300
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,080
She's lied to me
several times too.

301
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,221
So at least you know
it's not personal.

302
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,613
Like it wasn't personal

303
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,089
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

304
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,421
without so much
as texting me first.

305
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,086
Henry, trust me,
better me than them.

306
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,028
Them.
IRENE: Anyone but me.

307
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,864
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

308
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,635
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

309
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,468
Limited reserves.

310
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,268
L just need a little bit.

311
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,107
I gave what I had to a friend.

312
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,269
Why the hell
would you do that?

313
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,108
But it is killing her.

314
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,115
So without your help, she will
die and so will the magic.

315
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,977
All right.

316
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,719
Tell me about this Voltaic
Transfer you performed.

317
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,117
TODD: Oh, shit.
Margo's gonna kill me.

318
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,719
You knew about this?

319
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,230
I thought I was very clear

320
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,324
about not looking
in the cubbyhole.

321
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,834
You were.
That's why I looked.

322
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,096
Fray, what are those?

323
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,003
Fairy eggs. That Father
and Margo took.

324
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,438
You don't know that.
Just when I was starting

325
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,172
to think humans aren't all
bad, they steal babies?

326
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,679
The Fairy Queen
stole you from us.

327
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,273
No, you bargained me away.
I did no such thing.

328
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,913
It was a fair deal.
This is kidnapping.

329
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,322
Unlike you, we have honour.

330
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,123
You're not a fairy, Fray.

331
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,861
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

332
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,763
as anything but human?

333
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,625
Because she won't

334
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,035
That's not true.

335
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,800
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

336
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,173
That's pretty cold.

337
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,677
FEN:
Humans are complicated.

338
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,145
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

339
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,479
Yeah, like, I once
donated a kidney

340
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,212
to this girl I really liked.

341
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,379
Only, it turned out she didn't
actually need it for a transplant.

342
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,687
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

343
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,125
My daughter, and Eliot's.
And...

344
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:18,201
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

345
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,801

I would say

just trying to cast

532
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,436

that I have magic,

being stuck here.

I'd laugh pretty hard.

Look, this tweaker's worried
the Key's already moving on,

do with it?

I should have known.

How could I not know?

to believe Fray.

807

willed it hard enough,

00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,955
