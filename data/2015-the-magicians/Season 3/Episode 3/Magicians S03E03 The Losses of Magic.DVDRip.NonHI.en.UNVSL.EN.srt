1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,763
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,806
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,398
<i>The Tale of the Seven Keys.</i>

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,370
My father's dying, and
I need you to fix him.

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,672
<i>I require someone I
trust to accompany you.</i>

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,511
I'd like you to
meet your daughter.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,778
What?

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,581
<i>Just say it. Cancer.</i>

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,018
<i>Call it cancer plus.</i>

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,350
How long till I die?

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,186
No, you're not going to, okay?

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,827
Holy shit.

13
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,693
<i>As a Niffin, you made enemies.</i>

14
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,698
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,700
Who? WARLOCK: The Lamprey.

16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,861
What do you want with
the Lamprey anyway?

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,871
It's more what the
Lamprey wants with me.

18
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,372
Well, if you could do magic...

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,874
Yeah, well, I can't.

20
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,139
You're down to an early warning
device... An alarm, if you will.

21
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,241
Help you?

22
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,206
Sorry about this.

23
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,075
I need your help.

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,416
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

25
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,458
So, I'm not dead anymore.

26
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,488
Alice?

27
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,887
Shit.

28
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,933
Hi, Mom.

29
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,462
So, I'm alive.

30
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,937
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,909
Quentin called us after it happened,
and you're just visiting us now.

32
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,340
I've been meaning to come by...

33
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,110
Excuse the mess.

34
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,280
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

35
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,824
when magic vanished.

36
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,951
But then, you'd know
that if you ever called.

37
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,659
Who's she?

38
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,063
That's Carol.

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,624
That's Carol?

40
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,795
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

41
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,135
a lot of illusion work to
keep herself looking thin.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,765
So, now she drinks.

43
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,140
Carol?

44
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,109
You remember my daughter, Alice?

45
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,980
She used to be dead.

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,173
Now she isn't.

47
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,284
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

48
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,480
And she brought a cat.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,826
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

50
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,095
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,534
Kinda creeps me out every
time I pick it up, though.

52
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,104
We need a rabbit.

53
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,782
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

54
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,172
How close is the nearest island?

55
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,970
Beyond Fillory's
territorial waters,

56
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,274
the islands don't
like to be mapped,

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,507
so sometimes they move.

58
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,258
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

59
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,842
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,353
Mmm. LACKER: All hands on deck!

61
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,732
What's going on, Admiral?

62
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,666
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

63
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,562
Pirates.

64
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,774
They're flying the red
bones, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,735
No quarter given.

66
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,144
Well, shit.

67
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,575
Hey, Q. Did you find Kady?

68
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,244
No, I struck out.

69
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,753
<i>Yeah, so did Josh.</i>

70
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,949
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

71
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,692
Do you wanna meet me here, or...

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,092
<i>No, I can't.</i>

73
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,706
I have to leave town.
My dad got worse.

74
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,426
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

75
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,397
<i>Let me know if you
need anything, okay?</i>

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,559
Will do.

77
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,761
I should go.

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,712
Hi.

79
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,781
Can I come in?

80
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,542
Please?

81
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,983
Give me another chance.

82
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,788
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,987
He looks terrible.

84
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,124
And getting worse.

85
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,230
I have a ritual that could save
him but it requires a lot of magic,

86
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,236
so, you can participate,
or you can fuck off.

87
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,737
Dealer's choice.

88
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,932
What's the ritual?

89
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,807
We're gonna summon a demon.

90
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,170
I don't understand.

91
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,797
What are the
pirates trying to do?

92
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,034
Kill us and take our ship.

93
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,474
Are they allowed to do that?

94
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,136
I thought father was the King.

95
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,474
He is.

96
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,540
That's why they want to
steal from him. He's rich.

97
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,493
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

98
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,247
Please, Your
Majesty, come with me.

99
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,890
What an odd way to
make a living, pirating.

100
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,155
We can make our stand here.

101
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,663
Fray, get behind me.

102
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,742
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

103
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,826
Please, Lady Fen, if
we fight, they'll kill us.

104
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,360
Plus, are we super totally sure
that talking to them won't work?

105
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,962
No, pirates take.
That's what they do.

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,633
Will you not fight, Father?

107
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,769
Your father is a powerful Magician,
but when magic disappeared...

108
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,313
Is father a coward, then?

109
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,007
Father's a survivor.

110
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,180
That's weird.

111
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,643
Was there always a
keyhole right there?

112
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,884
Wait a second.

113
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,077
Mom, can we talk
privately, please?

114
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,553
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

115
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,524
We were just discussing how magic
is due to come back anytime now.

116
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,288
What a cute little kitten.

117
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,125
Oh. Oh!

118
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,858
Back off, Carol!

119
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,901
Alice, really?

120
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,765
Just stay away from her.

121
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,201
Don't be ridiculous.

122
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,967
Now, Carol is in a
very fragile state...

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,597
You need to listen
to me right now.

124
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,834
No, no, no, no.

125
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,909
You listen to me.

126
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,103
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

127
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,772
without any regard
for people's feelings.

128
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,776
Fine.

129
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,976
Where's Dad, then?

130
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,243
Look, all I'm saying is,

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

132
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,252
Look, I'd love to be more
cautious, but Penny is gonna die.

133
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:10,457
So, if you have a better
idea right now, I'm all ears.

134
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,735
Okay.

135
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,597
What do you need me to do?

136
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,344
I need a goat femur, pencil shavings,
and some other stuff for the summoning.

137
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,176
Oh, Alice.

138
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,720
I am so glad to see you.

139
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,655
When we heard, I knew that you
would take the time that you need, but...

140
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,190
Dad, we have to hurry.

141
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,919
There's a Lamprey after me.

142
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,461
A Lamprey?

143
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,894
What did you do to it?

144
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,456
It's not important, it...

145
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,967
But it's after me and
anyone connected to me,

146
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,971
and, look, I think it's
inside Carol right now.

147
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,631
But... Carol is
with your mother.

148
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,732
And I tried to warn
her, but you know Mom.

149
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,473
If I had any magic at all, I'd
be able to fight it, but I don't.

150
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,606
So, I need your help. Now.

151
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,640
Seriously, Tick?

152
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,151
What is the problem here?

153
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,213
I asked for two simple things.

154
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,317
Pull up the fields, plant
some goddamn mushrooms.

155
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,159
If you will allow me to
mansplain, Your Highness,

156
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,859
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

157
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,663
to throw out food
and replace it with...

158
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,000
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

159
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:29,702
And mansplaining
is a bad thing, Tick.

160
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,870
But I'm a man... Explaining.

161
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,413
Is that not mansplaining?

162
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,312
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

163
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,785
It's not me. It's
the fucking fairies.

164
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,549
This is more of their bullshit.

165
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:46,115
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,
and now mushroom fields.

166
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,128
I just need it done. Okay?

167
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,994
The Queen will not be pleased.

168
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,900
Are the fairies here right now?

169
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,028
They were.

170
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,606
Now they've gone
to tell the Queen

171
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,800
that we screwed the
pooch right in the pooper.

172
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,969
That sounds painful. It is.

173
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,672
Your Highness!

174
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,044
We just received a
report from the seagulls

175
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,344
that the <i>Muntjac</i> has
been captured by pirates.

176
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,045
Two days' sail
from After Island.

177
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,519
Son of a twat.

178
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,051
Tick, what is the
fastest boat in our Navy?

179
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,425
The <i>Morgan Downs,</i> ma'am,
could reach the <i>Muntjac</i> in a week.

180
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,226
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

181
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,463
No, it is not the
best we can muster.

182
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,596
Follow me, dickholes.

183
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,001
Did she call us "dickholes"?

184
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,083
Queen Margo.

185
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,752
Perhaps you can tell
me what's taking so long

186
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,089
to plant the mushroom fields.

187
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,861
Mushroom screw-ups
are on these chuckleheads.

188
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,500
Meanwhile, I have
a real problem.

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,799
The High King was hijacked
by pirates and I can't help him.

190
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,202
But you can.

191
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,070
I don't see why
that's my problem.

192
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,406
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

193
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,776
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

194
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,610
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

195
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,617
'cause we can't even
defend our high king?

196
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,119
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

197
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,620
see what happens then.

198
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,987
Interesting argument.

199
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,249
I'll tell you what.

200
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,161
I can bring you
there via <i>Pegasus,</i>

201
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,267
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

202
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,598
When do we leave?

203
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,601
These two need to come with.

204
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,844
Oh, my God...

205
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,385
Alice!

206
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,510
Daniel.

207
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,021
What are you doing?

208
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,559
Mom, I don't expect you to understand,
but Carol has a Lamprey inside of her

209
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,403
and if I don't get it
out, it'll kill all of us.

210
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,123
An old Sumerian
text suggested that

211
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,360
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

212
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,866
Oh, God.

213
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,835
And...

214
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,980
What are you doing?

215
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,132
Oh...

216
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,004
Damn it, it's dead.

217
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,639
Quentin, tell her to put that
thing down right this instant.

218
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,714
What are you doing here?

219
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,360
Your cat exploded. What
did you expect me to do?

220
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,751
Not, like, follow
me home. Jesus.

221
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,513
Hold on, your cat exploded?

222
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,853
Cats detect Lampreys
by exploding.

223
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,489
All of you, stay away from me!

224
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,063
Oh, great.

225
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,194
Now Carol won't come
over here anymore.

226
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,901
Honey, I know this
really isn't the time,

227
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,873
but shouldn't the Lamprey have come
out of Carol after you shocked her?

228
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,717
But the kitten freaked
out when it looked at Carol.

229
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,540
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

230
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,341
Maybe the Lamprey isn't here.

231
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,541
Yeah, well, maybe the
Lamprey doesn't exist.

232
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:59,052
The Lamprey exists, Mother,
and it can track long distances,

233
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,211
and it's coming for me.

234
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,789
Why, what did you do to it?

235
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,221
You wouldn't understand.

236
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,088
Why don't you just try me?

237
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,094
Whatever she did, she did
it because she was a Niffin.

238
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,630
Oh, God, Daniel, I
know she was a Niffin.

239
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,565
I thought she was
dead for months.

240
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,897
Wait a second.

241
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,939
You thought that Carol
had this Lamprey in her,

242
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,064
and you left me alone with her?

243
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,336
I told you to get away from her.

244
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,574
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

245
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,742
Quentin, what's going
on with your neck?

246
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,080
What do you mean?

247
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,252
Honey, I thought I saw
Quentin's neck move.

248
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,119
What? STEPHANIE: Wait.

249
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,657
Where did Quentin get to?

250
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,984
Shit.

251
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,227
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

252
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,199
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

253
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,202
They can be most
quarrelsome creatures.

254
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,761
I smell like a
horse fucked a bird.

255
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,239
Actually, it was the
other way around.

256
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:58,768
I'm going to go sun myself up
here while you chat with your pirates.

257
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,404
But don't worry.

258
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,108
I got my eye on you.

259
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,777
Who are you lot supposed to be?

260
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm High Queen Margo the
Destroyer, and the entourage.

261
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,288
You brought a fairy with you.

262
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,952
You can see her?

263
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,760
Yes, well, most pirates have made
a fairy deal at one time or another.

264
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,857
My name is Hoop, Ms. Destroyer.

265
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,234
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

266
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,008
My Queen, a word before you go?

267
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,341
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

268
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,108
around the court as pickpockets?

269
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,649
I've heard. What's your point?

270
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,016
Only that my skills in this
field could be useful to you.

271
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,145
I'll keep an eye on my
jewels. Are we done here?

272
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,330
Are you suggesting
that you could...

273
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,901
Although Her Majesty
lacks depth perception,

274
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,836
she does not lack in
depth or perception.

275
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:02,069
You keep an eye on the pirates.

276
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,373
If anything turns up missing,
we'll know they're the culprits.

277
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,607
I shall catch up with
you below decks, ma'am.

278
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,514
What on Earth are you doing?

279
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,818
I can't afford even
the tiniest crack.

280
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,553
When the Lamprey
is outside the host,

281
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,322
it can enter through
almost any opening.

282
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,523
Why do you assume
the Lamprey's even here?

283
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,622
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

284
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,066
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

285
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,194
You really saw his neck move?

286
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,863
You know, without
your optical spells,

287
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,204
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

288
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,902
I mean, it looked weird.

289
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,944
We can't risk it. If the
Lamprey is in the house,

290
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,913
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

291
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,381
What if Quentin tries to
get back in here himself?

292
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,884
We could call the police.

293
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,285
They could come and
get him out of the house.

294
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,754
Problem solved.

295
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,553
That's a bad idea. If it's inside
Quentin, who knows what he'll do?

296
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,251
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

297
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,057
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

298
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,566
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the Lamprey.

299
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,500
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

300
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,403
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

301
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,702
I'm gonna need more wine.

302
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,904
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

303
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,913
No, a gun won't protect
us against a Lamprey.

304
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,916
That is the only weapon that we
have, except the battery's dead.

305
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,212
We need a new one.

306
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,547
There's a car in the garage.

307
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,747
Don't those use
some kind of battery?

308
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,719
Okay, now what are you doing?

309
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,252
The Lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

310
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,060
even skin, so I'm
going to get that battery

311
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,294
and I'm not taking any chances.

312
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,698
Thank you.

313
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,773
Yeah.

314
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,143
You're missing the signs, Julia.

315
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,408
What?

316
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,608
I thought you'd
be further along.

317
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,116
We're going to have to push you.

318
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,088
What are you talking about?

319
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,015
I said thank you.

320
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,456
Oh. Sorry.

321
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,570
Alice.

322
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,836
Hey!

323
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,389
Don't come any closer
or I'll smash your head in!

324
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,881
Alice, come on!

325
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,575
Ah! I'm not the Lamprey, Alice!

326
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,174
How do I know you're
not the Lamprey!

327
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,662
I don't know how to
prove it. I'm just, I'm not...

328
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,518
It's... It's gone! It left!

329
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,557
What?

330
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,020
Why did it leave you?

331
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,356
I don't know.

332
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,264
I was awake the whole time.

333
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,867
I could feel it controlling me
and searching my memory.

334
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,374
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

335
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,274
It's angry at you, Alice.

336
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,370
What did you do to it?

337
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,540
I... I don't remember.

338
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,981
It's weird.

339
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,710
I could've snapped your
neck over there so easy.

340
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,380
And the Lamprey didn't
want to for some reason.

341
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,551
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

342
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,755
I am taking our
daughter seriously.

343
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,389
Help me finish taping up
the windows, won't you?

344
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,728
Fine.

345
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,302
But wouldn't it be
nice if just once,

346
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,397
Alice would come without
bringing all of her drama with her?

347
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,842
What's with the candy?

348
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,253
You gonna summon some kind of
chocolate-loving demon to save my ass?

349
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:14,090
The scent of chocolate
makes them less likely to eat us.

350
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,328
I hope.

351
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,767
The only nice thing
about losing magic...

352
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,667
The radio signals in
my head went out too.

353
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,798
All's quiet on
the psychic front?

354
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,506
Yeah.

355
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,476
Could get used to that.

356
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,946
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

357
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,617
Damn.

358
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,247
You sure you wanna do this?

359
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,315
There's a lot of magic in that.

360
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,417
You sure you wanna
waste it on me?

361
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,826
I stole it.

362
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,294
It's my call.

363
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,631
You don't owe me anything, Kady.

364
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,498
Of course you'd say that.

365
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,769
You got poisoned
trying to help me.

366
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,837
If I didn't try
to help you, I...

367
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,141
I couldn't live with myself.

368
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,837
Guess I should say thanks.

369
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,844
Yeah, you should.

370
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,657
Julia will be back soon.

371
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,361
I will try not to die.

372
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,573
I appreciate that.

373
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,485
Good job, Tick.

374
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,518
Your praise is everything, but I
would also like a country estate.

375
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,223
Don't get greedy.

376
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,696
Queen Margo the
Destroyer, my king.

377
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,206
You're the pirate king?

378
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:12,335
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

379
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,879
That's fine by me.

380
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

381
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,013
Maybe you and I could, um,

382
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:26,048
take a private cabin and
parlay a thing or two on our own.

383
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,626
Yeah, I'm hot.

384
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,026
You're extremely hot yourself.

385
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,533
But you just took
over my goddamn boat,

386
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,627
which tells me you're not one
to pay attention to a safe word.

387
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,433
What's a safe word?

388
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,063
Exactly.

389
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,371
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

390
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:52,348
But... You give me what I want, I
won't take anything off the table.

391
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,417
Hmm.

392
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,554
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

393
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,220
Well, we've all got a thing.

394
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,289
I need to see High King Eliot.

395
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,058
Now.

396
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,137
Mmm-hmm.

397
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,578
My Queen!

398
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,086
It is I, your High King Eliot...

399
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,847
In the flesh.

400
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,494
So, you think it left the house?

401
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,660
Yes, and we need to find out what it
really wanted before it comes back.

402
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,000
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

403
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,507
but I was thinking we might be
better off avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

404
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,133
I was thinking Asian myself.

405
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,269
Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

406
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,041
But you said it left the house.

407
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,946
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

408
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,144
Mom. STEPHANIE: Darling...

409
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,480
I have to go to the bathroom.

410
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,884
There's one right out there.

411
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,718
Don't you think we would've
heard it if it had come back inside?

412
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,658
Mom, the Lamprey is tiny, but
it is a powerful magical creature.

413
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,126
Don't underestimate it.

414
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:13,155
First you said it was inside of
Carol, so you electrocuted her.

415
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,760
Then you said it was inside
of Quentin, only now he's back,

416
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,169
and the creature's
gone for some reason.

417
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,833
Am I the only one that
this sounds crazy to?

418
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,068
Stephanie, sweetheart...

419
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,076
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

420
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,204
We've both been in this
room for God knows how long,

421
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,839
and I have to pee.

422
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,009
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

423
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,643
Just go in the corner, Mom.

424
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,279
I am not peeing in
front of your father.

425
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,849
If I had wanted that in my marriage,
I would've stayed with Jean Claude.

426
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,552
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

427
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,322
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

428
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,522
And I am not gonna risk
it just because you think

429
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,090
that you stepped on some
creature's magical toes.

430
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,463
I didn't step on its toes.

431
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,197
I murdered its entire family.

432
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,710
I did experiments on them to figure
out what kind of magic they had.

433
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,870
That's what I did as a Niffin.

434
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,811
Jesus, Alice.

435
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,215
Well, you know, we've all
dealt with our share of monsters.

436
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,547
You don't get it.

437
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,679
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

438
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,816
The Lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

439
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,724
It's just the one
who got my number.

440
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:19,424
So, I wanna be absolutely clear
on who the real monster is here.

441
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,667
Excuse me.

442
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,242
That didn't really help. I know.

443
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,708
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

444
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,152
Okay, I'll go after her.

445
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,882
Just you and your
dad keep researching.

446
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,687
My Asian languages
are for shit, anyway.

447
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,592
You better tape up.

448
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,754
Yeah.

449
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,593
Just to be safe. Yeah.

450
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,257
So, brass tacks.

451
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,929
You want 3,000
Fillorian Gold Crescents?

452
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,904
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

453
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,941
I'm crying from
my one eye for you.

454
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,704
There is one more matter.

455
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,714
Our ship, the <i>Sika,</i> is a
Deer Class vessel like yours.

456
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,114
So?

457
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,117
So, it's been a dry voyage.

458
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,450
It's no coincidence
we met like this.

459
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,956
The <i>Sika</i> sought out the
<i>Muntjac</i> after he scented her.

460
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,890
And now he needs her to submit.

461
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,254
What?

462
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,266
Our boat wants
to fuck your boat.

463
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,461
And we can't
leave until he does.

464
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,002
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

465
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:39,636
and as such, they have the
same sort of biological urges we do.

466
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,112
Although, our ship is
subject to royal command.

467
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,743
Which I couldn't
give, but you can.

468
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,818
So, what?

469
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,151
I just tell our boat to spread it
for their boat and we're done?

470
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,581
What are you not telling me?

471
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:56,220
Well, the boat can be
upset by the experience.

472
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,229
They're not the same after.

473
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,656
Not the same?

474
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,162
Like, how?

475
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,931
They become
distracted, irritable.

476
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,563
Sometimes, they
can't sail right.

477
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,575
Some ships have to be put
into dry dock, never to sail again.

478
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,202
That sounds like PTSD.

479
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,979
So, these pirates are asking
us to let our boat get raped?

480
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:24,990
My Queen's words, as
always, are coarse, but truthful.

481
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,548
I love this old boat,

482
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,729
but if they don't get what they
want, the pirates will kill the crew.

483
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,878
Ah!

484
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,088
That's a new look for you.

485
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,188
Would you come back
with me? It's not safe in here.

486
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,194
Oh, you heard Alice.

487
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,729
She's the monster.

488
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,630
Come on, she's not a
monster, she's just... Conflicted.

489
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,065
What's it matter?

490
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,727
It's not safe anywhere.

491
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,042
Did you know we got
a tax bill for the house?

492
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,703
Apparently, we
haven't paid in 30 years.

493
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,408
Enchantment failed, so
now we're losing our home.

494
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:27,180
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

495
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,589
I mean, get fucking jobs?

496
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,091
I don't even know
how to do anything.

497
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,027
And Daniel.

498
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,125
There's no place
for us in this world.

499
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:43,458
Sometimes I think Charlie
was the one who got off easy.

500
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,335
Oh, shit.

501
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,712
I am Asteroth.

502
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,289
Astaroth, Demon of the Seventh
Circle, Great Duke of The Inferno.

503
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,191
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

504
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,093
Astaroth with an A is my cousin.

505
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,564
You can totally stand.

506
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,965
The whole kneeling
thing's weird.

507
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,313
It's pretty advanced,
and it'll be tough to extract.

508
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,914
Though, those are the tastiest.

509
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,459
Can you do anything?

510
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,457
Surgery.

511
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,858
But it will hurt.

512
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,214
Just, save it, okay?

513
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,216
You'd astrally project, too.

514
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,512
No shame, bro.

515
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,561
Oh, my head is swimming.

516
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,030
I can't read Chinese right now.

517
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,225
How do you read so fast?

518
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,858
This isn't fast.

519
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,946
When I was a Niffin, I didn't
have to rely on my eyes.

520
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,939
This is like running
through water.

521
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,438
It's so slow.

522
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,240
What you said to your
mother, is that true?

523
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,745
What you did to that
Lamprey's family?

524
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,773
When I was a Niffin,

525
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,511
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

526
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,121
Wait, hold on.

527
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,448
What is it?

528
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,557
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

529
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,888
It's a parasite similar
to the Lamprey.

530
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,557
I think I know what it's doing.

531
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,773
So, um, <i>Muntjac?</i>

532
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,208
I'm High Queen Margo of Fillory.

533
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,472
Your Liege.

534
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,577
I have a kind of problem.

535
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,307
See,

536
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,317
a bunch of pirates boarded you

537
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,910
and are threatening
to kill the crew

538
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,253
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

539
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:57,554
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

540
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,565
in a Johnny Depp sort
of way, but the fact is,

541
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,569
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

542
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,969
In a Johnny Depp sort of way.

543
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,032
Look...

544
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,770
I could just order you to do it,

545
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,679
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

546
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,978
You have thoughts
and feelings...

547
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,013
I think.

548
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,122
So, I guess I'm asking...

549
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,118
What do you wanna do?

550
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,700
Maybe I'm an idiot
for even asking.

551
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,607
There, there.

552
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:54,878
Gonna be okay.

553
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,251
I mean, look at me.

554
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,326
I'm a mess.

555
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,659
I have to clean myself up.

556
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,699
I do, I have to clean myself...

557
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,026
What are you... No, no, no, no.

558
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:15,906
What the hell?

559
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,101
No, she was,

560
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,203
kissing me, and I'm
just... Stop, I'm trying to...

561
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,875
Oh, please, we're both adults.

562
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,214
You don't get to judge.

563
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,378
Step away from him, Mom.

564
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,286
Stephanie, do you honestly
have to make this about you too?

565
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,382
Don't psychoanalyze me, Daniel.

566
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,892
Back away, Mom.

567
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,724
Don't raise your
voice to me. Oh, God.

568
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,387
Her neck... She's the Lamprey.

569
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,659
What? Oh, don't be ridiculous.

570
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,394
I saw it. Her neck moved.

571
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,732
I told you to back the
fuck away from him!

572
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:51,702
What?

573
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,105
The Lamprey should
leave her body.

574
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,071
Any moment now.

575
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,076
I swear to God, she kissed me.

576
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,413
Shut up, Quentin.

577
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,581
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

578
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,246
Anything's possible.

579
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,642
The Lamprey
already took you over.

580
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,422
It doesn't wanna kill us because
it... Wants to lay eggs inside of us.

581
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,764
And then what?

582
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,458
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

583
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,561
until you die, and then
feeds on the carcass.

584
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,903
I don't understand.

585
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,874
The Lamprey
should've left her by now.

586
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,937
Unless it hasn't left Quentin.

587
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,606
Oh, God. No.

588
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,912
He was trying to kiss her so that
the Lamprey would jump into her body.

589
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:33,984
No.

590
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,647
Stay away from me!

591
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,021
Quentin...

592
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,353
I am not the Lamprey.

593
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,121
This isn't really a
great way to prove that.

594
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,322
If you're not the Lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

595
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,475
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

596
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,991
that I'm not the Lamprey,
and when I do it...

597
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,768
You'll know what to do.

598
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,655
Oh, bravo.

599
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,386
Nicely done.

600
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,225
You got me.

601
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,860
I'm gonna give you one
chance to leave my dad.

602
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,024
Or what?

603
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,124
You'll kill me?

604
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,368
You killed my family.

605
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,471
That wasn't me.

606
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,167
I don't remember
what I did as a Niffin.

607
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,368
Alice, I know you're lying.

608
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,034
Your father could always tell.

609
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,941
That little twitch you get.

610
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,245
You murdered every one of my children
because you were seeking knowledge.

611
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,512
So, what did you learn

612
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,054
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

613
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,022
I wanna know.

614
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,956
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

615
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:55,133
When they died, they
made pretty little lights.

616
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:59,802
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

617
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,377
It's funny the things you
can sense from the inside.

618
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,241
That one still loves you.

619
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:12,851
And your father
has a weak heart.

620
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,387
He'll die if you
try to shock me.

621
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,580
You don't know that.

622
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,213
You really wanna risk it?

623
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,091
And I'm sorry I wasn't
able to lay my eggs into her.

624
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:29,460
Since I know how much you hate
her, it's crueler to leave her alive.

625
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:34,468
Well, thank you for
finally being honest.

626
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,569
I'll let myself out.

627
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,597
Thank God.

628
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,969
Kill it, Alice.

629
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,774
Congratulations.

630
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,944
Jesus Christ.

631
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,279
What did you do?

632
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:02,726
I was moved by your speech to
the <i>Muntjac,</i> coming to her defense.

633
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,955
So, I decided to intervene.

634
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,796
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

635
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,271
What?

636
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,031
You stood up to them.

637
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,007
You were a queen.

638
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,211
That's who I need you to be.

639
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,507
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

640
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,483
remember this room.

641
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,016
Now...

642
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,451
There's the matter
of your lying to me.

643
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,887
Did you think I wouldn't
be a queen with you?

644
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,359
Time to give it back.

645
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,568
It's my eye.

646
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,570
It was, but you made a deal.

647
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,612
Tick, Gillen, come here.

648
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,882
Someone has stolen
something from me.

649
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,718
Which one of you was it?

650
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,348
They didn't do this.

651
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,359
I did.

652
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,588
Fine, we do it your way.

653
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,231
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

654
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,270
catch a human by the... Tongue.

655
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,621
You may go.

656
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,630
What did you do?

657
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,393
There is a song
he does not like,

658
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,630
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

659
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:56,640
He will slowly go mad, then he
will not be of much use to you.

660
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,741
My eye.

661
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,953
The eye can never be fixed.

662
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,491
But you can't spy on me anymore.

663
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,119
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

664
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,632
You have a week's sail back to
Whitespire to think about what you've done.

665
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,935
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

666
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,476
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

667
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,123
What the hell did
you put in that?

668
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,819
It should kill any of the
eggs left inside of you.

669
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,121
Did you drink it all?

670
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,958
Mmm...

671
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,534
When you left Brakebills, you
said that you couldn't forgive me.

672
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,365
Was that real?

673
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,371
Didn't it feel real?

674
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,071
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

675
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,308
where you push me
away in order to protect me.

676
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,853
From the Lamprey, or...

677
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,821
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

678
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,825
just going on the
way they were, it's just,

679
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:24,329
sort of sleeping
together, or whenever...

680
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,455
There were two of
us doing that, Alice.

681
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,523
It wasn't just me. Yeah, I know.

682
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,569
I know that, and it felt good,

683
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,471
I'm not saying that it didn't,
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

684
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,640
I'm just... I'm not
that girl anymore.

685
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,841
And I can't ever be her
again. I don't know how.

686
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:49,377
I know that I have said this before
and that it probably sounds ridiculous.

687
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,955
I just wanna help.

688
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,224
I really mean it.

689
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,056
Yeah, I know. I know you do.

690
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,590
I just...

691
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,927
I guess what I'm trying to
say is, I don't know what I want.

692
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,038
That's okay.

693
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,871
It's confusing.

694
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,941
I lived this whole other life,

695
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,543
and a part of that is still who
I am, whether I like it or not.

696
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,246
But when you look at me,

697
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,423
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

698
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,891
The old Alice, like... Like
that's who you want me to be.

699
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,555
She's gone.

700
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,093
It's just... It makes
it too hard, Quentin.

701
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,801
Alice!

702
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,131
Daniel!

703
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,738
Alice!

704
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,345
Daniel!

705
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,812
Oh, my God.

706
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,984
I think I've got it.

707
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,091
Oh, it's juicy.

708
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,161
I'll save it for later.

709
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,196
I'll close the wound.

710
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,305
It may take him
some time to heal.

711
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,104
Thank you.

712
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:04,788
Penny?

713
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,583
Penny.

714
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,586
Penny?

715
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
Penny.

716
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,389
No.

717
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,226
Penny, come on.

718
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,164
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,163
You called me too late.

720
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,431
No, no, no, he can't.

721
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,700
No, come on, Penny.

722
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,275
Don't... Don't, come on.

723
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,138
Oh, no.

724
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,077
No.

725
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,548
Shit.
