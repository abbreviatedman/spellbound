1
00:00:01,489 --> 00:00:02,959
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,983 --> 00:00:05,954
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,681
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

4
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,318
My father's dying, and
I need you to fix him.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:14,555
I require someone I
trust to accompany you.

6
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,423
I'd like you to meet your daughter.

7
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:17,624
What?

8
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,493
Just say it. Cancer.

9
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:20,827
Call it cancer plus.

10
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:22,095
How long till I die?

11
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,964
No, you're not going to, okay?

12
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,668
Holy shit.

13
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:29,570
As a niff in, you made enemies.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,573
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

15
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,575
- Who?
- The lamprey.

16
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:36,710
What do you want with
the lamprey anyway?

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,712
It's more what the
lamprey wants with me.

18
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,113
Well, if you could do magic...

19
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:41,715
Yeah, well, I can't.

20
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:43,550
You're down to an
early warning device...

21
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,018
an alarm, if you will.

22
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:20,987
Sorry about this.

23
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:24,891
I need your help.

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,162
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

25
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:32,433
So, I'm not dead anymore.

26
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,903
Alice?

27
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,172
Shit.

28
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:42,509
Hi, Mom.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,711
So, I'm alive.

30
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:45,779
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:48,181
Quentin called us after it happened,

32
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:50,717
and you're just visiting us now.

33
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:57,190
I've been meaning to come by...

34
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,925
Excuse the mess.

35
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:02,062
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

36
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,697
when magic vanished.

37
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,568
But then, you'd know
that if you ever called.

38
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,572
Who's she?

39
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,873
That's Carol.

40
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:14,541
That's Carol?

41
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,677
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

42
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:19,946
a lot of illusion work to
keep herself looking thin.

43
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:21,982
So, now she drinks.

44
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:23,484
Carol?

45
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,452
You remember my daughter, Alice?

46
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:26,887
She used to be dead.

47
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,689
Now she isn't.

48
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,658
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

49
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,226
And she brought a cat.

50
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:43,704
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

51
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,907
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

52
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,476
Kinda creeps me out every
time I pick it up, though.

53
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:50,911
We need a rabbit.

54
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,622
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

55
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:53,980
How close is the nearest island?

56
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,716
Beyond Fillory's territorial waters,

57
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:58,051
the islands don't like to be mapped,

58
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,253
so sometimes they move.

59
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:01,988
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

60
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,725
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

61
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:07,127
All hands are on deck!

62
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:20,641
What's going on, Admiral?

63
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:23,176
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

64
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:26,179
Pirates.

65
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,882
They're flying the red
bones, Your Majesty.

66
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,718
No quarter given.

67
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:35,021
Well, shit.

68
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:38,525
Hey, Q. Did you find Kady?

69
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,060
No, I struck out.

70
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,662
Yeah, so did Josh.

71
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,830
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

72
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:46,600
Do you wanna meet me here, or... ?

73
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,934
No, I... I can't.

74
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,570
I have to leave town. My dad got worse.

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,204
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

76
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:53,173
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

77
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:54,307
Will do.

78
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,942
I should go.

79
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,621
Hi.

80
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,155
Can I come in?

81
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:10,290
Please?

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,826
Give me another chance.

83
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,564
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:19,666
He looks terrible.

85
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:23,770
And getting worse.

86
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,338
I have a ritual that could save him

87
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,040
but it requires a lot of magic,

88
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,675
so, you can participate,

89
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:31,645
or you can fuck off. Dealer's choice.

90
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:34,114
What's the ritual?

91
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:36,683
We're gonna summon a demon.

92
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:05,011
I... I don't understand.

93
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,713
What are the pirates trying to do?

94
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,914
Kill us and take our ship.

95
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:10,250
Are they allowed to do that?

96
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,985
I thought father was the king.

97
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,253
He is.

98
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:15,288
That's why they want to
steal from him: He's rich.

99
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:17,166
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

100
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,793
Please, Your Majesty, come with me.

101
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:27,801
What an odd way to
make a living, pirating.

102
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,002
We can make our stand here.

103
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,403
Fray, get behind me.

104
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,414
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

105
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,741
Please, Lady Fen, if we
fight, they'll kill us.

106
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,843
Plus, are we super totally sure

107
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,178
that talking to them won't work?

108
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,846
No, pirates take. That's what they do.

109
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,381
Will you not fight, Father?

110
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:43,183
Your father is a powerful magician,

111
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,685
but when magic disappeared...

112
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,119
Is father a coward, then?

113
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,722
Father's a survivor.

114
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,724
That's weird.

115
00:05:50,754 --> 00:05:53,393
Was there always a keyhole right there?

116
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,931
Wait a second.

117
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,958
Mom, can we talk privately, please?

118
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:28,328
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

119
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:29,796
We were just discussing how

120
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,298
magic is due to come back any time now.

121
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,134
What a cute little kitten.

122
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:36,336
Oh.

123
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,807
- Back off, Carol!
- Alice, really?

124
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,709
Just stay away from her.

125
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,044
Don't be ridiculous.

126
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,879
Now, Carol is in a very fragile state...

127
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,380
You need to listen to me right now.

128
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,749
No, no, no, no.

129
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,183
You listen to me.

130
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,994
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

131
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:55,321
without any regard
for people's feelings.

132
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,723
Fine.

133
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:58,424
Where's Dad, then?

134
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,093
Look, all I'm saying is,

135
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:02,338
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

136
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,731
Look, I'd love to be more cautious,

137
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:06,099
but Penny is gonna die.

138
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,102
So, if you have a better idea right now,

139
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:10,771
I'm all ears.

140
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,844
Okay.

141
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,814
What do you need me to do?

142
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:22,816
I need a goat femur, pencil shavings,

143
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:25,151
and some other stuff for the summoning.

144
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:30,056
Alice.

145
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:33,459
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

146
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,961
When we heard, I knew that you would

147
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,429
take the time that you need, but...

148
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,064
Dad, we have to hurry.

149
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,200
There's a lamprey after me.

150
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,303
A lamprey?

151
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,805
What did you do to it?

152
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,272
It's not important, it...

153
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:48,875
but it's after me and
anyone connected to me,

154
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:51,878
and, look, I think it's
inside Carol right now.

155
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,413
But... Carol is with your mother.

156
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,481
And I tried to warn
her, but you know Mom.

157
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,150
If I had any magic at all,

158
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,285
I'd be able to fight it, but I don't.

159
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,354
So, I need your help.

160
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:02,956
Now.

161
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,424
Seriously, Tick?

162
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:06,026
What is the problem here?

163
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:10,096
I asked for two simple things.

164
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:14,167
Pull up the fields, plant
some goddamn mushrooms.

165
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:17,037
If you will allow me to
mansplain, Your Highness,

166
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,806
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

167
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:22,442
to throw out food and
replace it with, uh...

168
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,911
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

169
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,447
And mansplaining

170
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,482
is a bad thing, Tick.

171
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:32,819
But I'm a man... explaining.

172
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,254
Is that not mansplaining?

173
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:36,156
Perhaps you could woman-splain it to me.

174
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,525
It's not me. It's the fucking fairies.

175
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,361
This is more of their bullshit.

176
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:43,596
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,

177
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,999
and now mushroom fields.

178
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:49,002
I just need it done. Okay?

179
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:51,905
The queen will not be pleased.

180
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:55,842
Are the fairies here right now?

181
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,944
They were.

182
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:59,412
Now they've gone to tell the queen

183
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,547
that we screwed the
pooch right in the pooper.

184
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:02,883
That sounds painful.

185
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:03,913
It is.

186
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,451
Your Highness!

187
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:07,954
We just a received a
report from the seagulls

188
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:10,190
that the Muntjac has
been captured by pirates.

189
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,958
Two days' sail from After Island.

190
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:15,228
Son of a twat.

191
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:18,965
Tick, what is the
fastest boat in our Navy?

192
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:20,266
The Morgan Downs, ma'am,

193
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,268
could reach the Muntjac in a week.

194
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,105
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

195
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:30,076
No, it is not the best we can muster.

196
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,913
Follow me, dickholes.

197
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,613
Did she call us "dickholes"?

198
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,891
Queen Margo.

199
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,963
Perhaps you can tell
me what's taking so long

200
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,232
to plant the mushroom fields.

201
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,102
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

202
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,772
Meanwhile, I have a real problem.

203
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:05,009
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

204
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,310
But you can.

205
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,212
I don't see why that's my problem.

206
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:10,682
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

207
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:12,984
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

208
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,854
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

209
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:17,856
'cause we can't even
defend our High King?

210
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:20,258
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

211
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,261
see what happens then.

212
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,897
Interesting argument.

213
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,365
I'll tell you what.

214
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:31,402
I can bring you there via Pegasus,

215
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:35,373
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

216
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:36,841
When do we leave?

217
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,345
These two need to come with.

218
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:52,056
Oh, my God...

219
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,692
Alice!

220
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,793
Daniel.

221
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,194
What are you doing?

222
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,962
Mom, I don't expect you to understand,

223
00:10:57,993 --> 00:10:59,831
but Carol has a lamprey inside of her

224
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,441
and if I don't get it
out, it'll kill all of us.

225
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,267
An old Sumerian text suggested that

226
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:06,671
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

227
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:09,007
Oh, God.

228
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,041
And...

229
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:11,109
What are you doing?

230
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,246
Oh...

231
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,316
Damn it, it's dead.

232
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,084
Quentin,

233
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,029
tell her to put that thing
down right this instant.

234
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,755
What are you doing here?

235
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:25,232
Your cat exploded. What
did you expect me to do?

236
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:27,058
Not, like, follow me home. Jesus.

237
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,793
Hold on, your cat exploded?

238
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,062
Cats detect lampreys by exploding.

239
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,331
Ah!

240
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,234
All of you, stay away from me!

241
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,770
Oh, great.

242
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,339
Now Carol won't come over here anymore.

243
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:43,074
Honey, I know this
really isn't the time,

244
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:45,710
but shouldn't the lamprey
have come out of Carol

245
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,078
after you shocked her?

246
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,923
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

247
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:51,816
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

248
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,451
Maybe the lamprey isn't here.

249
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:55,820
Yeah, well, maybe the
lamprey doesn't exist.

250
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:57,756
The lamprey exists, Mother,

251
00:11:57,786 --> 00:11:59,223
and it can track long distances,

252
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:00,358
and it's coming for me.

253
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:03,027
Why, what did you do to it?

254
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:04,362
You wouldn't understand.

255
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:06,264
Why don't you just try me?

256
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:09,267
Whatever she did, she did
it because she was a niff in.

257
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,903
Oh, God, Daniel, I
know she was a niff in.

258
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,839
I thought she was dead for months.

259
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,107
Wait a second.

260
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:19,143
You thought that Carol
had this lamprey in her,

261
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,245
and you left me alone with her?

262
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:23,447
I told you to get away from her.

263
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:27,852
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

264
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:30,989
Quentin, what's going on with your neck?

265
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,024
What do you mean?

266
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,393
Honey, I thought I saw
Quentin's neck move.

267
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,295
- What?
- Wait.

268
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,063
Where did Quentin get to?

269
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,965
Shit.

270
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:45,369
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

271
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,338
is so persuasive with the Pegasi.

272
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,340
They can be most quarrelsome creatures.

273
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,010
I smell like a horse fucked a bird.

274
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,378
Actually, it was the other way around.

275
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:56,815
I'm going to go sun myself up here

276
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,017
while you chat with your pirates.

277
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,518
But don't worry.

278
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,354
I got my eye on you.

279
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,391
Who are you lot supposed to be?

280
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,994
I'm High Queen Margo the Destroyer,

281
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,163
and the entourage.

282
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,431
You brought a fairy with you.

283
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,166
You can see her?

284
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:17,501
Yes, well, most pirates
have made a fairy deal

285
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,003
at one time or another.

286
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:21,105
My name is Hoop, Ms. Destroyer.

287
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:24,508
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

288
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,214
My queen, a word before you go?

289
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:33,484
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

290
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,286
around the court as pickpockets?

291
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,921
I've heard. What's your point?

292
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:39,057
Um, only that my skills in this field

293
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:40,458
could be useful to you.

294
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:41,535
Mm-hmm, I'll keep an eye on my jewels.

295
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,928
Are we done here?

296
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,470
Are you suggesting that you could...

297
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,139
Although her majesty
lacks depth perception,

298
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,077
she does not lack in
depth or perception.

299
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:02,280
You keep an eye on the pirates.

300
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,082
If anything turns up missing,

301
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,184
we'll know they're the culprits.

302
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:10,121
I shall catch up with
you below decks, ma'am.

303
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,627
What on Earth are you doing?

304
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,063
I can't afford even the tiniest crack.

305
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,631
When the lamprey is outside the house,

306
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,466
it can enter through almost any opening.

307
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,635
Why do you assume the
lamprey's even here?

308
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,905
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

309
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:29,273
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

310
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:31,375
You really saw his neck move?

311
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:33,111
You know, without your optical spells,

312
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,379
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

313
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,148
I mean, it looked weird.

314
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:39,183
We can't risk it. If the
lamprey is in the house,

315
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:42,153
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

316
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:44,522
What if Quentin tries to
get back in here himself?

317
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,124
We could call the police.

318
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:48,459
They could come and get
him out of the house.

319
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,028
Problem solved.

320
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,371
That's a bad idea. If
it's inside Quentin,

321
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,663
who knows what he'll do?

322
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,432
They'll end up shooting him dead.

323
00:14:54,462 --> 00:14:58,269
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

324
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,671
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the lamprey.

325
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:03,607
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

326
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:06,544
a possessed cop with a
gun trying to kill us.

327
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm gonna need more wine.

328
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,150
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

329
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,152
No, a gun won't protect
us against a lamprey.

330
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,987
That is the only weapon that we have,

331
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,389
except the battery's
dead. We need a new one.

332
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,657
There's a car in the garage.

333
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,961
Don't those use some kind of battery?

334
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,966
Okay, now what are you doing?

335
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,434
The lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

336
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:33,271
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

337
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,940
and I'm not taking any chances.

338
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,179
Thank you.

339
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,713
Yeah.

340
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:46,317
You're missing the signs, Julia.

341
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:47,551
What?

342
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,720
I thought you'd be further along.

343
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,257
We're going to have to push you.

344
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:56,094
What are you talking about?

345
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,261
I said thank you.

346
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:58,997
Oh.

347
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:00,398
Sorry.

348
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,638
Alice.

349
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:52,841
Hey!

350
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:54,252
Don't come any closer or
I'll smash your head in!

351
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:55,878
Alice, come on!

352
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,646
I'm not the lamprey, Alice!

353
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,123
How do I know you're not the lamprey!

354
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,659
I don't know how to prove
it. I'm just, I'm not...

355
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,384
it's... it's gone! It left!

356
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,052
What?

357
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,789
Ah. Ugh.

358
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,990
Why did it leave you?

359
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,257
I don't know.

360
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,431
I was awake the whole time.

361
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:19,868
I could feel it controlling
me and searching my memory.

362
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:23,271
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

363
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:25,207
It's angry at you, Alice.

364
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:27,275
What did you do to it?

365
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:28,410
I...

366
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
I don't remember.

367
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:31,680
It's weird.

368
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:34,750
I could've snapped your
neck over there so easy.

369
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,285
And the lamprey didn't
want to for some reason.

370
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:40,422
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

371
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:43,792
I am taking our daughter seriously.

372
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:46,294
Help me finish taping up
the windows, won't you?

373
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,763
Fine.

374
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:50,232
But wouldn't it be nice if just once,

375
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,234
Alice would come without bringing

376
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:55,237
all of her drama with her?

377
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,848
What's with the candy?

378
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,850
You gonna summon some kind of

379
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,185
chocolate-loving demon to save my ass?

380
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:15,190
The scent of chocolate makes
them less likely to eat us.

381
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,760
I hope.

382
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:23,899
The only nice thing about losing magic?

383
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:26,735
The radio signals in
my head went out too.

384
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,171
All's quiet on the psychic front?

385
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:30,505
Yeah.

386
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,075
Could get used to that.

387
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:38,446
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

388
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,484
Damn.

389
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,186
You sure you wanna do this?

390
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,254
There's a lot of magic in that.

391
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:48,323
You sure you wanna waste it on me?

392
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,225
I stole it.

393
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,760
It's my call.

394
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,496
You don't owe me anything, Kady.

395
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:57,933
Of course you'd say that.

396
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:01,303
You got poisoned trying to help me.

397
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,171
If I didn't try to help you, I...

398
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:06,174
I couldn't live with myself.

399
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:08,243
Guess I should say thanks.

400
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,078
Yeah, you should.

401
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,527
Julia will be back soon.

402
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:28,263
I will try

403
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,397
not to die.

404
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:35,437
I appreciate that.

405
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:52,387
Good job, Tick.

406
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,156
Your praise is everything,

407
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,424
but I would also like a country estate.

408
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:59,194
Don't get greedy.

409
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:05,567
Queen Margo the Destroyer, my king.

410
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:08,170
You're the pirate king?

411
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,274
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

412
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,909
That's fine by me.

413
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:18,881
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

414
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:22,017
Maybe you and I could, uh,

415
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:26,054
take a private cabin and parlay
a thing or two on our own.

416
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,522
Yeah, I'm hot.

417
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:30,025
You're extremely hot yourself.

418
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:33,428
But you just took over my goddamn boat,

419
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,430
which tells me you're not one

420
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,532
to pay attention to a safe word.

421
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:39,367
What's a safe word?

422
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,069
Exactly.

423
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,373
I'm here on business, not pleasure.

424
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:46,942
But, um...

425
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:49,945
you give me what I want,

426
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:53,181
I won't take anything off the table.

427
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,150
Hmm.

428
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,453
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

429
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,388
Well,

430
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,558
we've all got a thing.

431
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:06,962
I need to see High King Eliot.

432
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,897
Now.

433
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:15,303
Mm-hmm.

434
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,613
My queen!

435
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:27,449
It is I, your High King Eliot...

436
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:31,586
In the flesh.

437
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,727
So, you think it left the house?

438
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,814
Yes, and we need to find
out what it really wanted

439
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,348
before it comes back.

440
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:46,059
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

441
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,752
but I was thinking
we might be better off

442
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,253
avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

443
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:50,955
I was thinking Asian myself.

444
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:53,057
Uh, Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

445
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,892
But you said it left the house.

446
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,795
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

447
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:58,963
- Mom.
- Darling...

448
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,231
I have to go to the bathroom.

449
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:02,099
There's one right out there.

450
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,376
Don't you think we would've heard it

451
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:04,702
if it had come back inside?

452
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,037
Mom, the lamprey is tiny,

453
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,380
but it is a powerful magical creature.

454
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:08,940
Don't underestimate it.

455
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,342
First you said it was inside of Carol,

456
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,977
so you electrocuted her.

457
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:15,112
Then you said it was inside of Quentin,

458
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:16,648
only now he's back,

459
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:18,983
and the creature's gone for some reason.

460
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,719
Am I the only one that
this sounds crazy to?

461
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,920
Stephanie, sweetheart...

462
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:24,922
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

463
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:28,025
We've both been in this
room for God knows how long,

464
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,727
and I have to pee.

465
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,863
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

466
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,364
Just go in the corner, Mom.

467
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,032
I am not peeing in front of your father.

468
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,968
If I had wanted that in my marriage,

469
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,736
I would've stayed with Jean Claude.

470
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,304
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

471
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:43,107
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

472
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:45,276
And I am not gonna risk
it just because you think

473
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:50,147
that you stepped on some
creature's magical toes.

474
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:52,283
I didn't step on its toes.

475
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:54,018
I murdered its entire family.

476
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:56,287
I did experiments on them to figure out

477
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:57,430
what kind of magic they had.

478
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,757
That's what I did as a niff in.

479
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:01,693
Jesus, Alice.

480
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:05,029
Well, you know, we've all dealt
with our share of monsters.

481
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,297
You don't get it.

482
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:09,400
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

483
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,704
The lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

484
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:14,438
It's just the one who got my number.

485
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:16,774
So, I wanna be absolutely clear

486
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:20,144
on who the real monster is here.

487
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:24,148
Excuse me.

488
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,325
That didn't really help.

489
00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:35,960
I know.

490
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,430
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

491
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,999
Okay, I'll go after her.

492
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,768
Just you and your dad keep researching.

493
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,404
My Asian languages are for shit, anyway.

494
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,340
You better tape up.

495
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,474
Yeah.

496
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:52,343
- Just to be safe.
- Yeah.

497
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,078
So, brass tacks.

498
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:57,815
You want 3,000 Fillorian Gold Crescents?

499
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:59,784
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

500
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,819
I'm crying from my one eye for you.

501
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,421
There is, uh, one more matter.

502
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:06,490
Our ship, the Sika,

503
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,026
is a Deer Class vessel like yours.

504
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:11,963
- So?
- So, it's been a dry voyage.

505
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:15,232
It's no coincidence we met like this.

506
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:18,836
The Sika sought out the
Muntjac after he scented her.

507
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,372
And now he needs her to submit.

508
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,208
What?

509
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:27,211
Our boat wants to fuck your boat.

510
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:30,047
And we can't leave until he does.

511
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:34,886
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

512
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,521
and as such, they have the same sort of

513
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,390
biological urges we do.

514
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,959
Although, our ship is
subject to royal command.

515
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,462
Which I couldn't give, but you can.

516
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:47,164
So, what?

517
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,441
I just tell our boat to
spread it for their boat

518
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:50,868
and we're done?

519
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:52,336
What are you not telling me?

520
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,073
Well, the boat can be
upset by the experience.

521
00:24:56,104 --> 00:24:58,475
They're not the same after.

522
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,544
Not the same?

523
00:25:00,574 --> 00:25:02,013
Like, how?

524
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,816
They become distracted, irritable.

525
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:06,350
Sometimes, they can't sail right.

526
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,953
Some ships have to be put into dry dock,

527
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:10,354
never to sail again.

528
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,791
That sounds like PTSD.

529
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:19,864
So, these pirates are asking
us to let our boat get raped?

530
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:23,267
My queen's words, as always, are coarse,

531
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:24,869
but truthful.

532
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,337
I love this old boat,

533
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,572
but if they don't get what they want,

534
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:30,942
the pirates will kill the crew.

535
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:58,102
That's a new look for you.

536
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:00,047
Would you come back with
me? It's not safe in here.

537
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:02,039
Oh, you heard Alice.

538
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,474
She's the monster.

539
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:06,343
Come on, she's not a
monster, she's just...

540
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,411
conflicted.

541
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,413
What's it matter?

542
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,884
It's not safe anywhere.

543
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:15,920
Did you know we got a
tax bill for the house?

544
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,455
Apparently, we haven't paid in 30 years.

545
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:23,227
Enchantment failed, so
now we're losing our home.

546
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:27,364
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

547
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,367
I mean, get fucking jobs?

548
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:33,504
I don't even know how to do anything.

549
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,139
And Daniel.

550
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:38,242
There's no place for us in this world.

551
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:40,611
Sometimes I think

552
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:44,015
Charlie was the one who got off easy.

553
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:51,288
Ah, shit.

554
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:32,396
I am Asteroth.

555
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:38,035
Astaroth, Demon of the Seventh Circle,

556
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,137
Great Duke of The Inferno.

557
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:42,073
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

558
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:44,976
Astaroth with an A is my cousin.

559
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,377
You can totally stand.

560
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:49,680
The whole kneeling thing's weird.

561
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,862
It's pretty advanced,

562
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,465
and it'll be tough to extract.

563
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:12,935
Though, those are the tastiest.

564
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:15,305
Can you do anything?

565
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:17,307
Surgery.

566
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:19,875
But it will hurt.

567
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:36,392
Just, save it, okay?

568
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,394
You'd astrally project, too.

569
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,763
No shame, bro.

570
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,423
Oh, my head is swimming.

571
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,792
I can't read Chinese right now.

572
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:54,160
How do you read so fast?

573
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,661
This isn't fast.

574
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,706
When I was a niff in, I
didn't have to rely on my eyes.

575
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,732
This is like running through water.

576
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:02,268
It's so slow.

577
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,171
What you said to your
mother, is that true?

578
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:09,109
What you did to that lamprey's family?

579
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:10,610
When I was a niff in,

580
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,346
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

581
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:17,517
Wait, hold on.

582
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,319
What is it?

583
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:23,189
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

584
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,691
It's a parasite similar to the lamprey.

585
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,128
I think I know what it's doing.

586
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:34,600
So, um, Muntjac?

587
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:38,138
I'm High Queen Margo of Fillory.

588
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,240
Your Liege.

589
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,508
I have a kind of problem.

590
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,244
See,

591
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:46,612
a bunch of pirates boarded you

592
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,714
and are threatening to kill the crew

593
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,818
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

594
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:57,423
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

595
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:00,426
in a Johnny Depp sort
of way, but the fact is,

596
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:04,430
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

597
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:07,400
in a Johnny Depp sort of way.

598
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,871
Look...

599
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:13,606
I could just order you to do it,

600
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:16,542
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

601
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:19,645
You have thoughts and feelings...

602
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:21,881
I think.

603
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:25,285
So, I guess I'm asking...

604
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:28,454
What do you wanna do?

605
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:39,299
Maybe I'm an idiot for even asking.

606
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:51,811
There, there.

607
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,648
Gonna be okay.

608
00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:00,686
I mean, look at me.

609
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:02,255
I'm a mess.

610
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:05,258
I have to clean myself up.

611
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,693
I do, I have to clean myself...

612
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,830
What are you... no, no, no, no.

613
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:14,667
Oh.

614
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:15,735
What the hell?

615
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:17,903
Uh, no, she was, um,

616
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:21,607
kissing me, and um, I'm
just... stop, I'm trying to...

617
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:25,711
Oh, please, we're both adults.

618
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:26,979
You don't get to judge.

619
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:28,314
Step away from him, Mom.

620
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,515
Stephanie, do you honestly

621
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:31,251
have to make this about you too?

622
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:33,319
Oh, don't psychoanalyze me, Daniel.

623
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,720
Back away, Mom.

624
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,589
- Don't raise your voice to me.
- Oh, God.

625
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:38,324
Her... her neck... she's the lamprey.

626
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,526
What? Oh, don't be ridiculous.

627
00:31:40,557 --> 00:31:42,328
I saw it. Her neck moved.

628
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,597
I told you to back
the fuck away from him!

629
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,737
What?

630
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:54,607
The lamprey should leave her body.

631
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:56,309
Any moment now.

632
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:57,877
I swear to God, she kissed me.

633
00:31:57,907 --> 00:31:59,679
Shut up, Quentin.

634
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,482
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

635
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:04,016
Anything's possible.

636
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:05,485
The lamprey already took you over.

637
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:07,553
It doesn't wanna kill us because it...

638
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,990
wants to lay eggs inside of us.

639
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,659
And then what?

640
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:17,397
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

641
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:19,465
until you die, and then
feeds on the carcass.

642
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:21,734
I don't understand.

643
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:26,038
The lamprey should've left her by now.

644
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:27,773
Unless it hasn't left Quentin.

645
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:29,509
- Oh, God.
- No.

646
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,444
He was trying to kiss
her so that the lamprey

647
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:32,745
would jump into her body.

648
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:34,780
No.

649
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:35,981
Stay away from me!

650
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:37,049
Quentin...

651
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,319
I am not the lamprey.

652
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,921
This isn't really a
great way to prove that.

653
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:45,658
If you're not the lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

654
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,369
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

655
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,963
that I'm not the lamprey,
and when I do it...

656
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:53,399
you'll know what to do.

657
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,886
Oh, bravo.

658
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,688
Nicely done.

659
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,457
You got me.

660
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,725
I'm gonna give you one
chance to leave my dad.

661
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:21,461
Or what?

662
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:24,397
You'll kill me?

663
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,332
You killed my family.

664
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:27,700
That wasn't me.

665
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,977
I don't remember what
I did as a niff in.

666
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:30,336
Alice, I know you're lying.

667
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,871
Your father could always tell.

668
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,773
That little twitch you get.

669
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,442
You murdered every one of my children

670
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,043
because you were seeking knowledge.

671
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:40,446
So, what did you learn

672
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,449
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

673
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,751
I wanna know.

674
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,556
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

675
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:54,894
When they died, they
made pretty little lights.

676
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:59,632
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

677
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:05,137
It's funny the things you
can sense from the inside.

678
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,840
That one still loves you.

679
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,712
And your father has a weak heart.

680
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:15,147
He'll die if you try to shock me.

681
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:16,516
You don't know that.

682
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:18,017
You really wanna risk it?

683
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:21,921
And I'm sorry I wasn't able
to lay my eggs into her.

684
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:26,492
Since I know how much you hate her,

685
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,595
it's crueler to leave her alive.

686
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:35,067
Well, thank you for
finally being honest.

687
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:37,503
I'll let myself out.

688
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:06,532
Thank God.

689
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,768
Kill it, Alice.

690
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:53,578
Congratulations.

691
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,880
Jesus Christ.

692
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:57,582
What did you do?

693
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,019
I was moved by your
speech to the Muntjac,

694
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:04,022
coming to her defense.

695
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:08,192
So, I decided to intervene.

696
00:36:08,223 --> 00:36:12,230
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

697
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:14,899
What?

698
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,635
You stood up to them.

699
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:18,603
You were a queen.

700
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,639
That's who I need you to be.

701
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:24,776
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

702
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,745
remember this room.

703
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:31,516
Now...

704
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:34,586
there's the matter of your lying to me.

705
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:38,823
Did you think I wouldn't
be a queen with you?

706
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:41,826
Time to give it back.

707
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:49,133
It's my eye.

708
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:51,536
It was,

709
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:55,974
but you made a deal.

710
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:59,544
Tick, Gillen, come here.

711
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:03,081
Someone has stolen something from me.

712
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:04,949
Which one of you was it?

713
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,186
They didn't do this.

714
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:09,754
I did.

715
00:37:09,785 --> 00:37:13,858
Fine, we do it your way.

716
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:18,763
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

717
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:23,935
catch a human by the... tongue.

718
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:42,621
You may go.

719
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,891
What did you do?

720
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:48,693
There is a song he does not like,

721
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,896
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

722
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:54,165
He will slowly go mad,

723
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:57,602
then he will not be of much use to you.

724
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:59,237
My eye.

725
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,149
The eye can never be fixed.

726
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,785
But you can't spy on me anymore.

727
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:17,288
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

728
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:19,791
You have a week's
sail back to Whitespire

729
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:22,794
to think about what you've done.

730
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:29,133
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

731
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:31,736
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

732
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,283
What the hell did you put in that?

733
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:48,052
It should kill any of the
eggs left inside of you.

734
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,287
Did you drink it all?

735
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:50,655
Mmm

736
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,895
When you left Brakebills,

737
00:38:56,925 --> 00:39:00,331
you said that you couldn't forgive me.

738
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:02,701
Was that real?

739
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:05,704
Didn't it feel real?

740
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,272
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

741
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:11,976
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

742
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,080
From the lamprey, or...

743
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:18,049
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

744
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,052
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

745
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:24,455
sort of sleeping
together, or whenever...

746
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:26,758
There were two of us doing that, Alice.

747
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:27,826
It wasn't just me.

748
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:28,856
Yeah, I know.

749
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:30,261
I...

750
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,864
I know that, and it felt good,

751
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:34,332
I'm not saying that it didn't,

752
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:37,135
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

753
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,905
I'm just... I'm not that girl anymore.

754
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:44,075
And I can't ever be her
again. I don't know how.

755
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:46,210
I know that I have said this before

756
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:49,714
and that it probably sounds ridiculous.

757
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:52,083
I just wanna help.

758
00:39:53,414 --> 00:39:54,414
I really mean it.

759
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:57,455
Yeah, I know. I know you do.

760
00:39:57,485 --> 00:40:00,124
I just...

761
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:03,728
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

762
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:05,797
I don't know what I want.

763
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:07,732
That's okay.

764
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:09,834
It's confusing.

765
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:14,038
I lived this whole other life,

766
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:17,075
and a part of that is still who I am,

767
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,811
whether I like it or not.

768
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:22,346
But when you look at me,

769
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:27,852
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

770
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,253
The old Alice, like...

771
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,122
like that's who you want me to be.

772
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:33,157
She's gone.

773
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:38,296
It's just... it makes
it too hard, Quentin.

774
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:43,434
Alice!

775
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:44,535
Daniel!

776
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:47,071
Alice!

777
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:48,940
Daniel!

778
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,042
Oh, my God.

779
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:36,587
I think I've got it.

780
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,222
Ooh, it's juicy.

781
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:40,791
I'll save it for later.

782
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,566
I'll close the wound.

783
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:52,103
It may take him some time to heal.

784
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:54,072
Thank you.

785
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:05,917
Penny?

786
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,919
Penny.

787
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:09,120
Penny?

788
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,554
Penny.

789
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:13,157
No.

790
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:15,059
Penny, come on.

791
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,196
I'm sorry.

792
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:19,964
You called me too late.

793
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,133
No, no, no, he can't.

794
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:23,334
No, come on, Penny.

795
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:25,336
Don't... don't, come on.

796
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:27,405
No.

797
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:29,007
No.

798
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:39,317
Shit.
