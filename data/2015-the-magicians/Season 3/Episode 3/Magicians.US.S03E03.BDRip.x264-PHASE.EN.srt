woman-splain it to me.

It's not me.
It's the fucking fairies.

This is more
of their bullshit.

183
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:46,125
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,
and now mushroom fields.

184
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,139

185
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,005

00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,911

here right now?

187
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,039
They were.

188
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,640
Now they've gone
to tell the Queen

189
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,811
that we screwed the pooch
right in the pooper.

190

reach the Muntjac in a week.

that's the best we can muster.

199

No, it is not
the best we can muster.

out of Carol after you shocked her?

around the court
as pickpockets?

292
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,660
I've heard.
What's your point?

293
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,026
Only that my skills in this
field could be useful to you.

that you could...

296

Although Her Majesty
lacks depth perception,

297
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,847
she does not lack in depth
or perception.

is outside the host,

304
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,333
it can enter through
almost any opening.

305
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,534
Why do you assume
the Lamprey's even here?

306
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,632
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

307
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,077
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

308
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,205
You really saw his neck move?

00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,874
You know, without
your optical spells,

310
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,213
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

311
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,912
I mean, it looked weird.

312
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,989
We can't risk it. If the
Lamprey is in the house,

313
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,924
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

314
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,392
What if Quentin tries
to get back in here himself?

315
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,895
We could call the police.

316
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,329
They could come and
get him out of the house.

317
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,765
Problem solved.

318
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,564
That's a bad idea. If it's inside
Quentin, who knows what he'll do?

319
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,262
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

320
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,068
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

321
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,576
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the Lamprey.

322
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,510
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

323
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,413
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

324
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,713
I'm gonna need more wine.

325
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,915
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

326
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,922
No, a gun won't protect us
against a Lamprey.

327
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,926
That is the only weapon that we
have, except the battery's dead.

328
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,222
We need a new one.

329
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,558
There's a car
in the garage.

330
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,758

some kind of battery?

Okay, now what are you doing?

332
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,263
The Lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

333
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,071
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

334

any chances.

Time to give it back.

699
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,579
It's my eye.

700
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,581
It was, but you made a deal.

701
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,657
Tick, Gillen, come here.

702
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,893
Someone has stolen
something from me.

703
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,728
Which one of you was it?

704
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,359
They didn't do this.

705
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,369
I did.

706
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,599
Fine, {SIGHS}
we do it your way.

707
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,242
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

708
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,280
catch a human by the...
Tongue.

709
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,961
(WHISPERING INAUDIBLY)

710
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,632
You may go.

711
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,641
What did you do?

712
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,404
There is a song
he does not like,

713
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,640
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

714
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:56,651
He will slowly go mad, then he
will not be of much use to you.

715
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,752
My eye.

716
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,964
The eye can never be fixed.

717
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,501
But you can't spy
on me anymore.

718
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,129
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

719
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,643
You have a week's sail back to Whitespire
to think about what you've done.

720
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,843
(PANTS)

721
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,945
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

722
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,487
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

723
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,586
(QUENTIN VOMITING)

724
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,860
(COUGHS)

725
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,134
What the hell
did you put in that?

726
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,830
It should kill any of the
eggs left inside of you.

727
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,132
Did you drink it all?

728
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,969
Mmm... (VOMITS)

729
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,545
When you left Brakebills, you said
that you couldn't forgive me.

730
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,375
Was that real?

731
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,382
Didn't it feel real?

732
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,116
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

733
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,319
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

734
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,864
From the Lamprey, or...

735
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,831
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

736
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,836
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

737
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:24,339
sort of sleeping together,
or whenever...

738
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,466
There were two of us
doing that, Alice.

739
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,533
It wasn't just me.
Yeah, I know.

740
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,078
L...

741
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,580
I know that,
and it felt good,

742
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,482
I'm not saying that it didn't,
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

743
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,651
I'm just...
I'm not that girl anymore.

744
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,852
And I can't ever be her again.
I don't know how.

745
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:49,388
I know that I have said this before and
that it probably sounds ridiculous.

746
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,989
L just wanna help.

747
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,225
I really mean it.

748
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,066
Yeah, I know. I know you do.

749
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,601
L just...

750
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,938
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, I don't know what I want.

751
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,049
That's okay.

752
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,882
It's confusing.

753
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,952
I lived
this whole other life,

754
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,554
and a part of that is still who
I am, whether I like it or not.

755
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,257
But when you look at me,

756
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,433
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

757
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,902
The old Alice, like... Like
that's who you want me to be.

758
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,566
She's gone.

759
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,466
(CHUCKLES)

760
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,103
It's just...
It makes it too hard, Quentin.

761
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,812
STEPHANIE: Alice!

762
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,142
Daniel!

763
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,749
Alice!

764

Daniel!

765
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,823
Oh, my God.

(INAUDIBLE)

767
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,995
I think I've got it.

768
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,102
Oh, it's juicy.

769
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,172
I'll save it for later.

770
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,207
I'll close the wound.

771
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,316
It may take him
some time to heal.

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,628
Penny.

776
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,630

00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,861

No. (GASPS)

I'm sorry.

00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,174
You called me loo late.

782
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,476
No, no, no, he can't.

783
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,711
No, come on, Penny.

784
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,309
Don't...
Don't, come on.

785
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,149
Oh, no.

786
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,088
No.
