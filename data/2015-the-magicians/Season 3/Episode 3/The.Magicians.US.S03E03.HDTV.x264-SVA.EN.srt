1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:01,366
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:04,861
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,588
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

4
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:10,225
My father's dying,
and I need you to fix him.

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,462
I require someone I trust
to accompany you.

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,330
I'd like you
to meet your daughter.

7
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:16,531
What?

8
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:18,400
Just say it.
Cancer.

9
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:19,734
Call it cancer plus.

10
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,002
How long till I die?

11
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,871
No, you're not going to, okay?

12
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:26,575
Holy shit.

13
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:28,477
As a niff in, you made enemies.

14
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,480
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

15
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,482
- Who?
- The lamprey.

16
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:35,617
What do you want
with the lamprey anyway?

17
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,619
It's more what
the lamprey wants with me.

18
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,020
Well, if you could do magic...

19
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:40,622
Yeah, well, I can't.

20
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:42,457
You're down to an
early warning device...

21
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:43,925
an alarm, if you will.

22
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:19,894
Sorry about this.

23
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:23,798
I need your help.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,069
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

25
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:31,340
So, I'm not dead anymore.

26
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,810
Alice?

27
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:38,079
Shit.

28
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:41,416
Hi, Mom.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,618
So, I'm alive.

30
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:44,686
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,088
Quentin called us
after it happened,

32
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:49,624
and you're just
visiting us now.

33
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:56,097
I've been meaning to come by...

34
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,832
Excuse the mess.

35
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,969
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

36
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:02,604
when magic vanished.

37
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:06,475
But then, you'd know that
if you ever called.

38
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,479
Who's she?

39
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:11,780
That's Carol.

40
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,448
That's Carol?

41
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,584
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

42
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,853
a lot of illusion work
to keep herself looking thin.

43
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,889
So, now she drinks.

44
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:22,391
Carol?

45
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,359
You remember my daughter,
Alice?

46
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,794
She used to be dead.

47
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,596
Now she isn't.

48
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,565
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

49
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,133
And she brought a cat.

50
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:42,611
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

51
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:45,814
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

52
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:48,383
Kinda creeps me out every time
I pick it up, though.

53
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,818
We need a rabbit.

54
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,520
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

55
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:52,887
How close is
the nearest island?

56
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,623
Beyond Fillory's
territorial waters,

57
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,958
the islands
don't like to be mapped,

58
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:59,160
so sometimes they move.

59
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,895
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

60
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,632
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

61
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:06,034
All hands are on deck!

62
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:19,548
What's going on, Admiral?

63
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:22,083
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

64
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:25,086
Pirates.

65
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,789
They're flying the red bones,
Your Majesty.

66
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,625
No quarter given.

67
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,928
Well, shit.

68
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:37,432
Hey, Q.
Did you find Kady?

69
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,967
No, I struck out.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,569
Yeah, so did Josh.

71
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:42,737
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

72
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:45,507
Do you wanna meet me here,
or...?

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,841
No, I-I can't.

74
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,477
I have to leave town.
My dad got worse.

75
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,111
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,080
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

77
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:53,214
Will do.

78
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:54,849
I should go.

79
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,528
Hi.

80
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,062
Can I come in?

81
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,197
Please?

82
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,733
Give me another chance.

83
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:16,471
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:18,573
He looks terrible.

85
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:22,677
And getting worse.

86
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,245
I have a ritual
that could save him

87
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:25,947
but it requires a lot of magic,

88
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,582
so, you can participate,

89
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:30,552
or you can fuck off.
Dealer's choice.

90
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:33,021
What's the ritual?

91
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:35,590
We're gonna summon a demon.

92
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,918
II don't understand.

93
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:05,620
What are the pirates
trying to do?

94
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:06,821
Kill us and take our ship.

95
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,157
Are they allowed to do that?

96
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,892
I thought father was the king.

97
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:12,160
He is.

98
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:14,195
That's why they want
He's rich.

99
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,064
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

100
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,700
Please, Your Majesty,
come with me.

101
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:26,708
What an odd way
to make a living, pirating.

102
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,909
We can make our stand here.

103
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,310
Fray, get behind me.

104
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,312
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

105
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,648
Please, Lady Fen,
if we fight, they'll kill us.

106
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:35,750
Plus, are we super totally sure

107
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,085
that talking to them
won't work?

108
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,753
No, pirates take.
That's what they do.

109
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,288
Will you not fight, Father?

110
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:42,090
Your father is
a powerful magician,

111
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,592
but when magic disappeared...

112
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,026
Is father a coward, then?

113
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,629
Father's a survivor.

114
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:49,631
That's weird.

115
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:52,300
Was there always
a keyhole right there?

116
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:56,838
Wait a second.

117
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,865
Mom,
can we talk privately, please?

118
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:27,235
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

119
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:28,703
We were just discussing how

120
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:31,205
magic is due to come back
any time now.

121
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,041
What a cute little kitten.

122
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,243
Oh.

123
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,714
- Back off, Carol!
- Alice, really?

124
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:41,616
Just stay away from her.

125
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,951
Don't be ridiculous.

126
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,786
Now, Carol is in
a very fragile state...

127
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,287
You need to listen
to me right now.

128
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,656
No, no, no, no.

129
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,090
You listen to me.

130
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:50,892
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

131
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,228
without any regard
for people's feelings.

132
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,630
Fine.

133
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,331
Where's Dad, then?

134
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,000
Look, all I'm saying is,

135
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,235
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

136
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,638
Look,
I'd love to be more cautious,

137
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,006
but Penny is gonna die.

138
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,009
So, if you have
a better idea right now,

139
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,678
I'm all ears.

140
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,751
Okay.

141
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:19,721
What do you need me to do?

142
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,723
I need a goat femur,
pencil shavings,

143
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:24,058
and some other stuff
for the summoning.

144
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:28,963
Alice.

145
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:32,366
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

146
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,868
When we heard,
I knew that you would

147
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,336
take the time that you need,
but...

148
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,971
Dad, we have to hurry.

149
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,107
There's a lamprey after me.

150
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,210
A lamprey?

151
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:43,712
What did you do to it?

152
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,179
It's not important, it...

153
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,782
but it's after me
and anyone connected to me,

154
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:50,785
and, look, I think
it's inside Carol right now.

155
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,320
But... Carol
is with your mother.

156
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:54,388
And I tried to warn her,
but you know Mom.

157
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,057
If I had any magic at all,

158
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,192
I'd be able to fight it,
but I don't.

159
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,261
So, I need your help.

160
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:01,863
Now.

161
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,331
Seriously, Tick?

162
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:04,933
What is the problem here?

163
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:09,003
I asked for two simple things.

164
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:13,074
Pull up the fields,
plant some goddamn mushrooms.

165
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:15,944
If you will allow me
to mansplain, Your Highness,

166
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,713
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

167
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:21,349
to throw out food
and replace it with, uh...

168
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:23,818
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

169
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,354
And mansplaining

170
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,389
is a bad thing, Tick.

171
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:31,726
But I'm a man... explaining.

172
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,161
Is that not mansplaining?

173
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:35,063
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

174
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:38,432
It's not me.
It's the fucking fairies.

175
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,268
This is more of their bullshit.

176
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,503
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,

177
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:44,906
and now mushroom fields.

178
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,909
I just need it done.
Okay?

179
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,812
The queen will not be pleased.

180
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:54,749
Are the fairies here right now?

181
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,851
They were.

182
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,319
Now they've gone
to tell the queen

183
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:00,454
that we screwed the pooch
right in the pooper.

184
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,790
That sounds painful.

185
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:02,791
It is.

186
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,358
Your Highness!

187
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:06,861
We just a received
a report from the seagulls

188
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,097
that the Muntjac has
been captured by pirates.

189
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,865
Two days' sail
from After Island.

190
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,135
Son of a twat.

191
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:17,872
Tick, what is the fastest
boat in our Navy?

192
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,173
The Morgan Downs, ma'am,

193
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,175
could reach
the Muntjac in a week.

194
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,012
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

195
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:28,983
No, it is not
the best we can muster.

196
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,820
Follow me, dickholes.

197
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:44,432
Queen Margo.

198
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,170
Perhaps you can tell me
what's taking so long

199
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,439
to plant the mushroom fields.

200
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,309
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

201
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:57,979
Meanwhile,
I have a real problem.

202
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:02,216
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

203
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,517
But you can.

204
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,419
I don't see why
that's my problem.

205
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,889
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

206
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,191
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

207
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:13,061
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

208
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,063
'cause we can't even
defend our High King?

209
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,465
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

210
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,468
see what happens then.

211
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:23,104
Interesting argument.

212
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:24,572
I'll tell you what.

213
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:28,609
I can bring you there
via Pegasus,

214
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:32,580
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

215
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,048
When do we leave?

216
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,552
These two need to come with.

217
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:49,263
Oh, my God...

218
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,899
Alice!

219
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,000
Daniel.

220
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,401
What are you doing?

221
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,169
Mom, I don't expect
you to understand,

222
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,038
but Carol has a lamprey
inside of her

223
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,639
and if I don't get it out,
it'll kill all of us.

224
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,474
An old Sumerian text
suggested that

225
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:03,878
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

226
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,214
Oh, God.

227
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,248
And...

228
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,316
What are you doing?

229
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,453
Oh...

230
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,523
Damn it, it's dead.

231
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:17,291
Quentin,

232
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,227
tell her to put that thing down
right this instant.

233
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,962
What are you doing here?

234
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,430
Your cat exploded.
What did you expect me to do?

235
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,265
Not, like, follow me home.
Jesus.

236
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,000
Hold on, your cat exploded?

237
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,269
Cats detect lampreys
by exploding.

238
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,538
Ah!

239
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,441
All of you, stay away from me!

240
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:35,977
Oh, great.

241
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,546
Now Carol won't
come over here anymore.

242
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,281
Honey, I know
this really isn't the time,

243
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,917
but shouldn't the lamprey
have come out of Carol

244
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,285
after you shocked her?

245
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,120
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

246
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:49,023
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

247
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,658
Maybe the lamprey isn't here.

248
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:53,027
Yeah, well, maybe
the lamprey doesn't exist.

249
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:54,963
The lamprey exists, Mother,

250
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,430
and it can track
long distances,

251
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:57,565
and it's coming for me.

252
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:00,234
Why, what did you do to it?

253
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,569
You wouldn't understand.

254
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,471
Why don't you just try me?

255
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:06,474
Whatever she did, she did it
because she was a niff in.

256
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,110
Oh, God, Daniel,
I know she was a niff in.

257
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:12,046
I thought she was dead
for months.

258
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,314
Wait a second.

259
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:16,350
You thought that Carol
had this lamprey in her,

260
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,452
and you left me alone with her?

261
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:20,654
I told you
to get away from her.

262
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:25,059
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

263
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:28,196
Quentin,
what's going on with your neck?

264
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,231
What do you mean?

265
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,600
Honey, I thought
I saw Quentin's neck move.

266
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,502
- What?
- Wait.

267
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,270
Where did Quentin get to?

268
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,172
Shit.

269
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:42,576
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

270
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,545
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

271
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,547
They can be most
quarrelsome creatures.

272
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,217
I smell like
a horse fucked a bird.

273
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,585
Actually,
it was the other way around.

274
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,022
I'm going to go
sun myself up here

275
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,224
while you chat
with your pirates.

276
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,725
But don't worry.

277
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:00,561
I got my eye on you.

278
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,598
Who are you lot supposed to be?

279
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:07,201
I'm High Queen Margo
the Destroyer,

280
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,370
and the entourage.

281
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:10,638
You brought a fairy with you.

282
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,373
You can see her?

283
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,708
Yes, well, most pirates
have made a fairy deal

284
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,210
at one time or another.

285
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,312
My name is Hoop,
Ms. Destroyer.

286
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:21,715
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

287
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:27,421
My queen, a word before you go?

288
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:30,691
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

289
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,493
around the court
as pickpockets?

290
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,128
I've heard.
What's your point?

291
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,264
Um, only that
my skills in this field

292
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,665
could be useful to you.

293
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:38,732
Mmhmm,
I'll keep an eye on my jewels.

294
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,135
Are we done here?

295
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,677
Are you suggesting
that you could...

296
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,346
Although her majesty
lacks depth perception,

297
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,284
she does not lack
in depth or perception.

298
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:59,487
You keep an eye on the pirates.

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,289
If anything turns up missing,

300
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,391
we'll know
they're the culprits.

301
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:07,328
I shall catch up with you
below decks, ma'am.

302
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,834
What on Earth are you doing?

303
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:16,270
I can't afford
even the tiniest crack.

304
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:17,838
When the lamprey
is outside the house,

305
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,673
it can enter through
almost any opening.

306
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,842
Why do you assume
the lamprey's even here?

307
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,112
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

308
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,480
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

309
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,582
You really saw his neck move?

310
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,318
You know,
without your optical spells,

311
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,586
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

312
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,355
I mean, it looked weird.

313
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:36,390
We can't risk it.
If the lamprey is in the house,

314
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,360
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

315
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:41,729
What if Quentin tries
to get back in here himself?

316
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,331
We could call the police.

317
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,666
They could come and
get him out of the house.

318
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,235
Problem solved.

319
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:48,569
That's a bad idea.
If it's inside Quentin,

320
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:49,870
who knows what he'll do?

321
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,639
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

322
00:14:51,672 --> 00:14:55,476
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

323
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,878
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the lamprey.

324
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,814
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

325
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:03,751
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

326
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:06,187
I'm gonna need more wine.

327
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,357
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

328
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,359
No, a gun won't protect us
against a lamprey.

329
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:13,194
That is the only weapon
that we have,

330
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:15,596
except the battery's dead.
We need a new one.

331
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:16,864
There's a car in the garage.

332
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:20,168
Don't those use
some kind of battery?

333
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,173
Okay, now what are you doing?

334
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,641
The lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

335
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,478
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

336
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:33,147
and I'm not taking any chances.

337
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,386
Thank you.

338
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah.

339
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:43,524
You're missing the signs,
Julia.

340
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:44,758
What?

341
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,927
I thought
you'd be further along.

342
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,464
We're going
to have to push you.

343
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,301
What are you talking about?

344
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:54,468
I said thank you.

345
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:56,204
Oh.

346
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,605
Sorry.

347
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,345
Alice.

348
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,548
Hey!

349
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:49,949
Don't come any closer
or I'll smash your head in!

350
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,585
Alice, come on!

351
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:53,353
I'm not the lamprey, Alice!

352
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,821
How do I know
you're not the lamprey!

353
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:56,356
I don't know how to prove it.
I'm just, I'm not...

354
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,091
it's... it's gone!
It left!

355
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,759
What?

356
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:02,496
Ah. Ugh.

357
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:03,697
Why did it leave you?

358
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,964
I don't know.

359
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,138
I was awake the whole time.

360
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:15,575
I could feel it controlling me
and searching my memory.

361
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,978
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

362
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,914
It's angry at you, Alice.

363
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,982
What did you do to it?

364
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,117
I...

365
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,118
I don't remember.

366
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,387
It's weird.

367
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,457
I could've snapped your neck
over there so easy.

368
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,992
And the lamprey didn't want to
for some reason.

369
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:36,129
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

370
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:39,499
I am taking
our daughter seriously.

371
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,001
Help me finish taping up
the windows, won't you?

372
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,470
Fine.

373
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,939
But wouldn't it be nice
if just once,

374
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:47,941
Alice would come
without bringing

375
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:50,944
all of her drama with her?

376
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:01,555
What's with the candy?

377
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,557
You gonna summon some kind of

378
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,892
chocolate-loving demon
to save my ass?

379
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:10,897
The scent of chocolate makes
them less likely to eat us.

380
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,467
I hope.

381
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:19,606
The only nice thing
about losing magic?

382
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:22,442
The radio signals
in my head went out too.

383
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,878
All's quiet
on the psychic front?

384
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,212
Yeah.

385
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,782
Could get used to that.

386
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:34,153
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

387
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,191
Damn.

388
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,893
You sure you wanna do this?

389
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:41,961
There's a lot of magic in that.

390
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,030
You sure you wanna
waste it on me?

391
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:45,932
I stole it.

392
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:47,467
It's my call.

393
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,203
You don't owe me anything,
Kady.

394
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:53,640
Of course you'd say that.

395
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:57,010
You got poisoned
trying to help me.

396
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:58,878
If I didn't try to help you,
I...

397
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,881
I couldn't live with myself.

398
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,950
Guess I should say thanks.

399
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:05,785
Yeah, you should.

400
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:21,234
Julia will be back soon.

401
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:23,970
I will try

402
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,104
not to die.

403
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,144
I appreciate that.

404
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,094
Good job, Tick.

405
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:49,863
Your praise is everything,

406
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,131
but I would also like
a country estate.

407
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:54,901
Don't get greedy.

408
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:01,274
Queen Margo the Destroyer,
my king.

409
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:03,877
You're the pirate king?

410
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,981
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

411
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:09,616
That's fine by me.

412
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:14,588
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

413
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,724
Maybe you and I could, uh,

414
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:21,761
take a private cabin and parlay
a thing or two on our own.

415
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,229
Yeah, I'm hot.

416
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:25,732
You're extremely hot yourself.

417
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:29,135
But you just took over
my goddamn boat,

418
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:31,137
which tells me you're not one

419
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,239
to pay attention
to a safe word.

420
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:35,074
What's a safe word?

421
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,776
Exactly.

422
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,080
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

423
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,649
But, um...

424
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:45,652
you give me what I want,

425
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:48,888
I won't take anything
off the table.

426
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,857
Hmm.

427
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,160
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

428
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:56,095
Well,

429
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,265
we've all got a thing.

430
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:02,669
I need to see High King Eliot.

431
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,604
Now.

432
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:11,010
Mm-hmm.

433
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,320
My queen!

434
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:23,156
It is I,
your High King Eliot...

435
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:27,293
In the flesh.

436
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,284
So,
you think it left the house?

437
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:36,371
Yes, and we need to find
out what it really wanted

438
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:37,905
before it comes back.

439
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,607
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

440
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,309
but I was thinking
we might be better off

441
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,810
avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

442
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,512
I was thinking Asian myself.

443
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:46,614
Uh, Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

444
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,449
But you said
it left the house.

445
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,352
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

446
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:52,520
- Mom.
- Darling...

447
00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:53,788
I have to go to the bathroom.

448
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:55,656
There's one right out there.

449
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,924
Don't you think
we would've heard it

450
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:58,259
if it had come back inside?

451
00:21:58,293 --> 00:21:59,594
Mom, the lamprey is tiny,

452
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:00,928
but it is a powerful
magical creature.

453
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,497
Don't underestimate it.

454
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,899
First you said
it was inside of Carol,

455
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,534
so you electrocuted her.

456
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,669
Then you said
it was inside of Quentin,

457
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,205
only now he's back,

458
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:12,540
and the creature's gone
for some reason.

459
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:15,276
Am I the only one
that this sounds crazy to?

460
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,477
Stephanie, sweetheart...

461
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,479
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

462
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:21,582
We've both been in this room
for God knows how long,

463
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:23,284
and I have to pee.

464
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:25,420
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

465
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:26,921
Just go in the corner, Mom.

466
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,589
I am not peeing
in front of your father.

467
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:30,525
If I had wanted
that in my marriage,

468
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,293
I would've stayed
with Jean Claude.

469
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:33,861
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

470
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,664
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

471
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:38,833
And I am not gonna risk it
just because you think

472
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:43,704
that you stepped on
some creature's magical toes.

473
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,840
I didn't step on its toes.

474
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:47,575
I murdered its entire family.

475
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,844
I did experiments on them
to figure out

476
00:22:49,877 --> 00:22:50,978
what kind of magic they had.

477
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,314
That's what I did as a niff in.

478
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:55,250
Jesus, Alice.

479
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:58,586
Well, you know, we've all dealt
with our share of monsters.

480
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,854
You don't get it.

481
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:02,957
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

482
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,261
The lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

483
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:07,995
It's just the one
who got my number.

484
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:10,331
So, I wanna be absolutely clear

485
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:13,701
on who the real monster
is here.

486
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,705
Excuse me.

487
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:27,882
That didn't really help.

488
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,517
I know.

489
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,987
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

490
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,556
Okay, I'll go after her.

491
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,325
Just you and your dad
keep researching.

492
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:40,961
My Asian languages are
for shit, anyway.

493
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:42,897
You better tape up.

494
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,031
Yeah.

495
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,900
- Just to be safe.
- Yeah.

496
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,635
So, brass tacks.

497
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:51,372
You want 3,000
Fillorian Gold Crescents?

498
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,341
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

499
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,376
I'm crying from
my one eye for you.

500
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,978
There is,
uh, one more matter.

501
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:00,047
Our ship, the Sika,

502
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,583
is a Deer Class vessel
like yours.

503
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:03,518
So?

504
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,520
So, it's been a dry voyage.

505
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:08,789
It's no coincidence
we met like this.

506
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:12,393
The Sika sought out the Muntjac
after he scented her.

507
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:14,929
And now he needs her to submit.

508
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:17,765
What?

509
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,768
Our boat wants
to fuck your boat.

510
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:23,604
And we can't leave
until he does.

511
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:28,443
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

512
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:31,078
and as such,
they have the same sort of

513
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:32,947
biological urges we do.

514
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,516
Although, our ship
is subject to royal command.

515
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,019
Which I couldn't give,
but you can.

516
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:40,721
So, what?

517
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:41,989
I just tell our boat
to spread it for their boat

518
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,425
and we're done?

519
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:45,893
What are you not telling me?

520
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:49,630
Well, the boat can be upset
by the experience.

521
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,032
They're not the same after.

522
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,101
Not the same?

523
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,570
Like, how?

524
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:58,373
They become distracted,
irritable.

525
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:59,907
Sometimes,
they can't sail right.

526
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,510
Some ships have
to be put into dry dock,

527
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,911
never to sail again.

528
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:07,348
That sounds like PTSD.

529
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,421
So, these pirates are asking us
to let our boat get raped?

530
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:16,824
My queen's words,
as always, are coarse,

531
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,426
but truthful.

532
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,894
I love this old boat,

533
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:22,129
but if they don't get
what they want,

534
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:24,499
the pirates will kill the crew.

535
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:51,659
That's a new look for you.

536
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:53,594
Would you come back with me?
It's not safe in here.

537
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:55,596
Oh, you heard Alice.

538
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,031
She's the monster.

539
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,900
Come on, she's not
a monster, she's just...

540
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:00,968
conflicted.

541
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:02,970
What's it matter?

542
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:06,441
It's not safe anywhere.

543
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:09,477
Did you know we got
a tax bill for the house?

544
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,012
Apparently,
we haven't paid in 30 years.

545
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:16,784
Enchantment failed,
so now we're losing our home.

546
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:20,921
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

547
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,924
I mean, get fucking jobs?

548
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,061
I don't even know
how to do anything.

549
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,696
And Daniel.

550
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:31,799
There's no place
for us in this world.

551
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:34,168
Sometimes I think

552
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:37,572
Charlie was the one
who got off easy.

553
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:44,845
Ah, shit.

554
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,953
I am Asteroth.

555
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:31,592
Astaroth,
Demon of the Seventh Circle,

556
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,694
Great Duke of The Inferno.

557
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,630
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

558
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:38,533
Astaroth with an A
is my cousin.

559
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:39,934
You can totally stand.

560
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,237
The whole
kneeling thing's weird.

561
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:59,119
It's pretty advanced,

562
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:01,722
and it'll be tough to extract.

563
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:05,192
Though, those are the tastiest.

564
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,562
Can you do anything?

565
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,564
Surgery.

566
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,132
But it will hurt.

567
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:28,649
Just, save it, okay?

568
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,651
You'd astrally project, too.

569
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:33,020
No shame, bro.

570
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,680
Oh, my head is swimming.

571
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:45,049
I can't read Chinese right now.

572
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,417
How do you read so fast?

573
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:47,918
This isn't fast.

574
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:49,954
When I was a niff in, I didn't
have to rely on my eyes.

575
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,989
This is like
running through water.

576
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,525
It's so slow.

577
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,428
What you said to your mother,
is that true?

578
00:28:57,462 --> 00:29:01,366
What you did to that
lamprey's family?

579
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,867
When I was a niff in,

580
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,603
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

581
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:09,774
Wait, hold on.

582
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,576
What is it?

583
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:15,446
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

584
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,948
It's a parasite
similar to the lamprey.

585
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:20,385
I think I know what it's doing.

586
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,857
So, um, Muntjac?

587
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,395
I'm High Queen Margo
of Fillory.

588
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:32,497
Your Liege.

589
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,765
I have a kind of problem.

590
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,501
See,

591
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:38,869
a bunch of pirates boarded you

592
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,971
and are threatening
to kill the crew

593
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:45,075
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

594
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:49,680
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

595
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:52,683
in a Johnny Depp sort of way,
but the fact is,

596
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:56,687
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

597
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:59,657
in a Johnny Depp sort of way.

598
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,128
Look...

599
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:05,863
I could just
order you to do it,

600
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:08,799
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

601
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,902
You have thoughts
and feelings...

602
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,138
I think.

603
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:17,542
So, I guess I'm asking...

604
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:20,711
What do you wanna do?

605
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:31,556
Maybe I'm an idiot
for even asking.

606
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:44,068
There, there.

607
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,905
Gonna be okay.

608
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,943
I mean, look at me.

609
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,512
I'm a mess.

610
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:57,515
I have to clean myself up.

611
00:30:57,548 --> 00:30:59,950
I do, I have to clean myself...

612
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:03,087
What are you...
no, no, no, no.

613
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:06,924
Oh.

614
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:07,992
What the hell?

615
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:10,160
Uh, no, she was, um,

616
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:13,864
kissing me, and um, I'm just...
stop, I'm trying to...

617
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:17,968
Oh, please,
we're both adults.

618
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,236
You don't get to judge.

619
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:20,571
Step away from him, Mom.

620
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:21,772
Stephanie, do you honestly

621
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:23,508
have to make this
about you too?

622
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:25,576
Oh, don't psychoanalyze me,
Daniel.

623
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,977
Back away, Mom.

624
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,846
- Don't raise your voice to me.
- Oh, God.

625
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,581
Her-her neck...
she's the lamprey.

626
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:32,783
What?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

627
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:34,585
I saw it.
Her neck moved.

628
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:36,854
I told you to back
the fuck away from him!

629
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:43,994
What?

630
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,864
The lamprey should
leave her body.

631
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:48,566
Any moment now.

632
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,134
I swear to God,
she kissed me.

633
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,936
Shut up, Quentin.

634
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,739
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

635
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:56,273
Anything's possible.

636
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:57,742
The lamprey
already took you over.

637
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,810
It doesn't wanna
kill us because it...

638
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:03,247
wants to lay eggs inside of us.

639
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,916
And then what?

640
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:09,654
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

641
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,722
until you die,
and then feeds on the carcass.

642
00:32:11,756 --> 00:32:13,991
I don't understand.

643
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:18,295
The lamprey should've
left her by now.

644
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:20,030
Unless it hasn't
left Quentin.

645
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,766
- Oh, God.
- No.

646
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,701
He was trying to kiss her
so that the lamprey

647
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,002
would jump into her body.

648
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:27,037
No.

649
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,238
Stay away from me!

650
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:29,306
Quentin...

651
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,576
I am not the lamprey.

652
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,178
This isn't really
a great way to prove that.

653
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:37,915
If you're not the lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

654
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:39,617
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

655
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,220
that I'm not the lamprey,
and when I do it...

656
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,656
you'll know what to do.

657
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,143
Oh, bravo.

658
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:07,945
Nicely done.

659
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:09,714
You got me.

660
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:11,982
I'm gonna give you
one chance to leave my dad.

661
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,718
Or what?

662
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:16,654
You'll kill me?

663
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,589
You killed my family.

664
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:19,957
That wasn't me.

665
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,225
I don't remember
what I did as a niff in.

666
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:22,593
Alice, I know you're lying.

667
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,128
Your father could always tell.

668
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,030
That little twitch you get.

669
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:28,699
You murdered every one
of my children

670
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,300
because you were
seeking knowledge.

671
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,703
So, what did you learn

672
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:35,706
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

673
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,008
I wanna know.

674
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:42,813
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

675
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:47,151
When they died,
they made pretty little lights.

676
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:51,889
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

677
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:57,394
It's funny the things
you can sense from the inside.

678
00:33:57,427 --> 00:34:00,097
That one still loves you.

679
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,969
And your father
has a weak heart.

680
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,404
He'll die
if you try to shock me.

681
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:08,773
You don't know that.

682
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:10,274
You really wanna risk it?

683
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:14,178
And I'm sorry I wasn't able
to lay my eggs into her.

684
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:18,749
Since I know
how much you hate her,

685
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:21,852
it's crueler
to leave her alive.

686
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:27,324
Well, thank you
for finally being honest.

687
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,760
I'll let myself out.

688
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,789
Thank God.

689
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:01,025
Kill it, Alice.

690
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,835
Congratulations.

691
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:46,137
Jesus Christ.

692
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:47,839
What did you do?

693
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:51,276
I was moved by
your speech to the Muntjac,

694
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:54,279
coming to her defense.

695
00:35:54,312 --> 00:35:58,449
So, I decided to intervene.

696
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:02,487
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

697
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,156
What?

698
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,892
You stood up to them.

699
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,860
You were a queen.

700
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:10,896
That's who I need you to be.

701
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:15,033
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

702
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,002
remember this room.

703
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:21,773
Now...

704
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:24,843
there's the matter
of your lying to me.

705
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:29,080
Did you think I wouldn't be
a queen with you?

706
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:32,083
Time to give it back.

707
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:39,390
It's my eye.

708
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:41,793
It was,

709
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:46,231
but you made a deal.

710
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:49,801
Tick, Gillen, come here.

711
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:53,338
Someone has stolen
something from me.

712
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,206
Which one of you was it?

713
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,443
They didn't do this.

714
00:36:58,476 --> 00:37:00,011
I did.

715
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:04,115
Fine, we do it your way.

716
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:09,020
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

717
00:37:09,054 --> 00:37:14,192
catch a human by the... tongue.

718
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,878
You may go.

719
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,148
What did you do?

720
00:37:37,182 --> 00:37:38,950
There is a song
he does not like,

721
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:42,153
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

722
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:44,422
He will slowly go mad,

723
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:47,859
then he will not be
of much use to you.

724
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,494
My eye.

725
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,406
The eye can never be fixed.

726
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:04,042
But you can't
spy on me anymore.

727
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,545
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

728
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:10,048
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

729
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:13,051
to think about
what you've done.

730
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:19,390
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

731
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,993
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

732
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:35,540
What the hell
did you put in that?

733
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:38,309
It should kill any
of the eggs left inside of you.

734
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:39,544
Did you drink it all?

735
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:40,912
Mmm

736
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:47,152
When you left Brakebills,

737
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:50,588
you said that
you couldn't forgive me.

738
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,958
Was that real?

739
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,961
Didn't it feel real?

740
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:58,529
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

741
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:02,233
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

742
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:06,337
From the lamprey, or...

743
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:08,306
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

744
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:11,309
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

745
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:14,712
sort of sleeping together,
or whenever...

746
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:17,015
There were two of us
doing that, Alice.

747
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:18,083
It wasn't just me.

748
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,084
Yeah, I know.

749
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:20,518
I...

750
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:23,121
I know that,
and it felt good,

751
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:24,589
I'm not saying that it didn't,

752
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:27,392
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

753
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,162
I'm just...
I'm not that girl anymore.

754
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:34,332
And I can't ever be her again.
I don't know how.

755
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:36,467
I know that
I have said this before

756
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,971
and that it probably
sounds ridiculous.

757
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,340
I just wanna help.

758
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:44,642
I really mean it.

759
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,712
Yeah, I know.
I know you do.

760
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:50,381
I just...

761
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:53,985
I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

762
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,054
I don't know what I want.

763
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:57,989
That's okay.

764
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,091
It's confusing.

765
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:04,295
I lived this whole other life,

766
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:07,332
and a part of that is still
who I am,

767
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:10,068
whether I like it or not.

768
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:12,603
But when you look at me,

769
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:18,109
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

770
00:40:18,143 --> 00:40:19,510
The old Alice, like...

771
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,379
like that's who
you want me to be.

772
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:23,414
She's gone.

773
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:28,553
It's just...
it makes it too hard, Quentin.

774
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,691
Alice!

775
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:34,792
Daniel!

776
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:37,328
Alice!

777
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:39,197
Daniel!

778
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,299
Oh, my God.

779
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:26,844
I think I've got it.

780
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:28,479
Ooh, it's juicy.

781
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,048
I'll save it for later.

782
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:38,823
I'll close the wound.

783
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:42,360
It may take him
some time to heal.

784
00:41:42,393 --> 00:41:44,329
Thank you.

785
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,174
Penny?

786
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:58,176
Penny.

787
00:41:58,209 --> 00:41:59,377
Penny?

788
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,811
Penny.

789
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:03,414
No.

790
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:05,316
Penny, come on.

791
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,453
I'm sorry.

792
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:10,221
You called me too late.

793
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:12,390
No, no, no, he can't.

794
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:13,591
No, come on, Penny.

795
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:15,593
Don't... don't, come on.

796
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:17,662
No.

797
00:42:17,695 --> 00:42:19,264
No.

798
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:29,574
Shit.
