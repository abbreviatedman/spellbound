00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,179
It's not important, it...

186
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,782
but it's after me
and anyone connected to me,

187
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:50,785
and, look, I think
it's inside Carol right now.

188
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,320
But... Carol
is with your mother.

189
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:54,388
And I tried to warn her,
but you know Mom.

190
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,057
If I had any magic at all,

191
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,192
I'd be able to fight it,
but I don't.

192
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,261
So, I need your help.

193
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:01,863
Now.

194
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,331
Seriously, Tick?

195
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:04,933
What is the problem here?

196
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:09,003
I asked for two simple things.

197
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:13,074
Pull up the fields,
plant some goddamn mushrooms.

198
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:15,944
If you will allow me
to mansplain, Your Highness,

199
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,713
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

200
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:21,349
to throw out food
and replace it with, uh...

201
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:23,818
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

202
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,354
And mansplaining

203
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,389
is a bad thing, Tick.

204
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:31,726
But I'm a man... explaining.

205
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,161
Is that not mansplaining?

206
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:35,063
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

207
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:38,432
It's not me.
It's the fucking fairies.

208
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,268
This is more of their bullshit.

209
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,503
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,

210
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:44,906
and now mushroom fields.

211
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,909
I just need it done.
Okay?

212
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,812
The queen will not be pleased.

213
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:54,749
Are the fairies here right now?

214
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,851
They were.

215
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,319
Now they've gone
to tell the queen

216
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:00,454
that we screwed the pooch
right in the pooper.

217
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,790
That sounds painful.

218
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:02,791
It is.

219
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,358
Your Highness!

220
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:06,861
We just a received
a report from the seagulls

221
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,097
that the Muntjac has
been captured by pirates.

222
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,865
Two days' sail
from After Island.

223
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,135
Son of a twat.

224
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:17,872
Tick, what is the fastest
boat in our Navy?

225
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,173
The Morgan Downs, ma'am,

226
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,175
could reach
the Muntjac in a week.

227
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,012
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

228
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:28,983
No, it is not
the best we can muster.

229
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,820
Follow me, dickholes.

230
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:44,065
.

231
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:44,432
Queen Margo.

232
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,170
Perhaps you can tell me
what's taking so long

233
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,439
to plant the mushroom fields.

234
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:53,007
[nervous laugh]

235
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,309
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

236
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:57,979
Meanwhile,
I have a real problem.

237
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:02,216
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

238
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,517
But you can.

239
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,419
I don't see why
that's my problem.

240
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,889
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

241
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,191
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

242
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:13,061
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

243
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,063
'cause we can't even
defend our High King?

244
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,465
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

245
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,468
see what happens then.

246
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:23,104
Interesting argument.

247
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:24,572
I'll tell you what.

248
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:28,609
I can bring you there
via Pegasus,

249
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:32,580
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

250
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,048
When do we leave?

251
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,283
[clears throat]

252
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:36,350
[sighs]

253
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,552
These two need to come with.

254
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:43,557
[both gasp]

255
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,394
[muffled whimpers]

256
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,062
[tape stretching]

257
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:49,263
Oh, my God...

258
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,899
Alice!

259
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,000
Daniel.

260
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,401
What are you doing?

261
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,169
Mom, I don't expect
you to understand,

262
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,038
but Carol has a lamprey
inside of her

263
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,639
and if I don't get it out,
it'll kill all of us.

264
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,474
An old Sumerian text
suggested that

265
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:03,878
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

266
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,214
- [panicked whimpering]
- Oh, God.

267
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,248
And...

268
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,316
What are you doing?

269
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:10,251
[muffled shrieking]

270
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,453
Oh...

271
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:14,322
[ragged breathing]

272
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,523
Damn it, it's dead.

273
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:17,291
Quentin,

274
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,227
tell her to put that thing down
right this instant.

275
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,962
What are you doing here?

276
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,430
Your cat exploded.
What did you expect me to do?

277
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,265
Not, like, follow me home.
Jesus.

278
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,000
Hold on, your cat exploded?

279
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,269
Cats detect lampreys
by exploding.

280
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,538
[grunting]
Ah!

281
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,441
All of you, stay away from me!

282
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:35,977
Oh, great.

283
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,546
Now Carol won't
come over here anymore.

284
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,281
Honey, I know
this really isn't the time,

285
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,917
but shouldn't the lamprey
have come out of Carol

286
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,285
after you shocked her?

287
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,120
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

288
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:49,023
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

289
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,658
Maybe the lamprey isn't here.

290
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:53,027
Yeah, well, maybe
the lamprey doesn't exist.

291
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:54,963
The lamprey exists, Mother,

292
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,430
and it can track
long distances,

293
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:57,565
and it's coming for me.

294
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:00,234
Why, what did you do to it?

295
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,569
You wouldn't understand.

296
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,471
Why don't you just try me?

297
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:06,474
Whatever she did, she did it
because she was a niff in.

298
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,110
Oh, God, Daniel,
I know she was a niff in.

299
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:12,046
I thought she was dead
for months.

300
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,314
Wait a second.

301
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:16,350
You thought that Carol
had this lamprey in her,

302
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:18,452
and you left me alone with her?

303
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:20,654
I told you
to get away from her.

304
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:25,059
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

305
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:28,196
Quentin,
what's going on with your neck?

306
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,231
What do you mean?

307
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,600
Honey, I thought
I saw Quentin's neck move.

308
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,502
- What?
- Wait.

309
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,270
Where did Quentin get to?

310
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,172
Shit.

311
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:42,576
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

312
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,545
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

313
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,547
They can be most
quarrelsome creatures.

314
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,217
I smell like
a horse fucked a bird.

315
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,585
Actually,
it was the other way around.

316
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,022
I'm going to go
sun myself up here

317
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,224
while you chat
with your pirates.

318
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,725
But don't worry.

319
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:00,561
I got my eye on you.

320
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,598
Who are you lot supposed to be?

321
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:07,201
I'm High Queen Margo
the Destroyer,

322
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,370
and the entourage.

323
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:10,638
You brought a fairy with you.

324
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,373
You can see her?

325
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,708
Yes, well, most pirates
have made a fairy deal

326
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,210
at one time or another.

327
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,312
My name is Hoop,
Ms. Destroyer.

328
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:21,715
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

329
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:27,421
My queen, a word before you go?

330
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:30,691
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

331
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,493
around the court
as pickpockets?

332
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,128
I've heard.
What's your point?

333
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,264
Um, only that
my skills in this field

334
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,665
could be useful to you.

335
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:38,732
Mmhmm,
I'll keep an eye on my jewels.

336
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,135
Are we done here?

337
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,677
Are you suggesting
that you could...

338
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,346
Although her majesty
lacks depth perception,

339
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,284
she does not lack
in depth or perception.

340
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:59,487
You keep an eye on the pirates.

341
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,289
If anything turns up missing,

342
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,391
we'll know
they're the culprits.

343
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:07,328
I shall catch up with you
below decks, ma'am.

344
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,834
What on Earth are you doing?

345
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:16,270
I can't afford
even the tiniest crack.

346
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:17,838
When the lamprey
is outside the house,

347
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,673
it can enter through
almost any opening.

348
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,842
Why do you assume
the lamprey's even here?

349
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,112
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

350
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,480
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

351
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,582
You really saw his neck move?

352
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,318
You know,
without your optical spells,

353
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,586
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

354
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,355
I mean, it looked weird.

355
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:36,390
We can't risk it.
If the lamprey is in the house,

356
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,360
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

357
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:41,729
What if Quentin tries
to get back in here himself?

358
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,331
We could call the police.

359
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,666
They could come and
get him out of the house.

360
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,235
