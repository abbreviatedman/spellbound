1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,940
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,730
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,430
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,070
My father's dying,
and I need you to fix him.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,300
I require someone I trust
to accompany you.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,170
I'd like you
to meet your daughter.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,240
Just say it.
Cancer.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,580
Call it cancer plus.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,710
No, you're not going to, okay?

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,420
Holy shit.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,320
As a niffin, you made enemies.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,320
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,320
The lamprey.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,460
What do you want
with the lamprey anyway?

15
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:44,065
It's more what
the lamprey wants with me.

16
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:45,465
Well, if you could do magic...

17
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,065
Yeah, well, I can't.

18
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:48,905
You're down to an
early warning device...

19
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,375
An alarm, if you will.

20
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,345
Sorry about this.

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,245
I need your help.

22
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:34,515
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

23
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:37,785
So, I'm not dead anymore.

24
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:44,525
Shit.

25
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:47,865
Hi, Mom.

26
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,065
So, I'm alive.

27
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:51,135
Oh, I know.

28
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,535
Quentin called us
after it happened,

29
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:56,075
and you're just visiting us now.

30
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,545
I've been meaning to come by...

31
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:04,275
Excuse the mess.

32
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:07,415
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

33
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,055
when magic vanished.

34
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:12,925
But then, you'd know that
if you ever called.

35
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:18,225
That's Carol.

36
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,035
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

37
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:25,295
a lot of illusion work
to keep herself looking thin.

38
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,335
So, now she drinks.

39
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:28,835
Carol?

40
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,805
You remember my daughter, Alice?

41
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,245
She used to be dead.

42
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,045
Now she isn't.

43
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:37,015
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

44
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,575
And she brought a cat.

45
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:49,055
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

46
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:52,265
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

47
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,825
Kinda creeps me out every time
I pick it up, though.

48
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:56,265
We need a rabbit.

49
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:57,971
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

50
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,335
How close is the nearest island?

51
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:01,065
Beyond Fillory's
territorial waters,

52
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:03,405
the islands
don't like to be mapped,

53
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:05,605
so sometimes they move.

54
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,345
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

55
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,075
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,485
All hands are on deck!

57
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,525
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

58
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:31,535
Pirates.

59
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,235
They're flying the red bones,
Your Majesty.

60
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,075
No quarter given.

61
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,375
Well, shit.

62
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:43,875
Hey, Q.
Did you find Kady?

63
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:45,415
No, I struck out.

64
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,015
Yeah, so did Josh.

65
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,185
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

66
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,955
Do you wanna meet me here,
or...?

67
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,285
No, I-I can't.

68
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,925
I have to leave town.
My dad got worse.

69
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,555
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

70
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,525
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

71
00:03:58,555 --> 00:03:59,665
Will do.

72
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,295
I should go.

73
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,975
Hi.

74
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,505
Can I come in?

75
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,645
Please?

76
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:18,175
Give me another chance.

77
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,915
Oh, my God.

78
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,015
He looks terrible.

79
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:29,125
And getting worse.

80
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:30,695
I have a ritual
that could save him

81
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,395
but it requires a lot of magic,

82
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:34,025
so, you can participate,

83
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,995
or you can fuck off.
Dealer's choice.

84
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,035
We're gonna summon a demon.

85
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:10,365
I-I don't understand.

86
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,065
What are the pirates
trying to do?

87
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,265
Kill us and take our ship.

88
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,335
I thought father was the king.

89
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,605
He is.

90
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,645
That's why they want
to steal from him: he's rich.

91
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,521
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

92
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,145
Please, Your Majesty,
come with me.

93
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:33,155
What an odd way
to make a living, pirating.

94
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,355
We can make our stand here.

95
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,755
Fray, get behind me.

96
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,771
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

97
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,095
Please, Lady Fen,
if we fight, they'll kill us.

98
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,195
Plus, are we super totally sure

99
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,535
that talking to them won't work?

100
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:45,195
No, pirates take.
That's what they do.

101
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:48,535
Your father is
a powerful magician,

102
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,035
but when magic disappeared...

103
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:54,075
Father's a survivor.

104
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,075
That's weird.

105
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:58,745
Was there always
a keyhole right there?

106
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:03,285
Wait a second.

107
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,315
Mom,
can we talk privately, please?

108
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:33,685
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

109
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,145
We were just discussing how

110
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,655
magic is due to come back
any time now.

111
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:39,485
What a cute little kitten.

112
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,685
Oh.

113
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,165
Back off, Carol!

114
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,065
Just stay away from her.

115
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,395
Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,235
Now, Carol is in
a very fragile state...

117
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:52,735
You need to listen
to me right now.

118
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,105
No, no, no, no.

119
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,535
You listen to me.

120
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,351
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

121
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,675
without any regard
for people's feelings.

122
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,075
Fine.

123
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:03,775
Where's Dad, then?

124
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:05,445
Look, all I'm saying is,

125
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,691
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

126
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:10,085
Look,
I'd love to be more cautious,

127
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:11,455
but Penny is gonna die.

128
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,455
So, if you have
a better idea right now,

129
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,125
I'm all ears.

130
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:23,195
Okay.

131
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,165
What do you need me to do?

132
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,165
I need a goat femur,
pencil shavings,

133
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,505
and some other stuff
for the summoning.

134
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,405
Alice.

135
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:38,815
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

136
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,315
When we heard,
I knew that you would

137
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:41,785
take the time that you need,
but...

138
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:43,415
Dad, we have to hurry.

139
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,555
There's a lamprey after me.

140
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,155
What did you do to it?

141
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:51,625
It's not important, it...

142
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:54,225
But it's after me
and anyone connected to me,

143
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,235
and, look, I think
it's inside Carol right now.

144
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,765
But... Carol
is with your mother.

145
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,835
And I tried to warn her,
but you know Mom.

146
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:02,505
If I had any magic at all,

147
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,635
I'd be able to fight it,
but I don't.

148
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,705
So, I need your help.

149
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:08,305
Now.

150
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,375
What is the problem here?

151
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:15,445
I asked for two simple things.

152
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:19,525
Pull up the fields,
plant some goddamn mushrooms.

153
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:22,395
If you will allow me
to mansplain, Your Highness,

154
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:25,155
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

155
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,795
to throw out food
and replace it with, uh...

156
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,265
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

157
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:32,805
And mansplaining

158
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:34,835
is a bad thing, Tick.

159
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:38,175
But I'm a man... explaining.

160
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:39,605
Is that not mansplaining?

161
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,505
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

162
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,875
It's not me.
It's the fucking fairies.

163
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,715
This is more of their bullshit.

164
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,945
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,

165
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:51,355
and now mushroom fields.

166
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:54,355
I just need it done.
Okay?

167
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:57,255
The queen will not be pleased.

168
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:01,195
Are the fairies here right now?

169
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,295
They were.

170
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,765
Now they've gone
to tell the queen

171
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,905
that we screwed the pooch
right in the pooper.

172
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,235
That sounds painful.

173
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,235
It is.

174
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,805
Your Highness!

175
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,305
We just a received
a report from the seagulls

176
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,545
that the Muntjac has
been captured by pirates.

177
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,315
Two days' sail
from After Island.

178
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:20,585
Son of a twat.

179
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:24,315
Tick, what is the fastest
boat in our Navy?

180
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,615
The Morgan Downs, ma'am,

181
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,625
could reach
the Muntjac in a week.

182
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:30,455
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

183
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:35,425
No, it is not
the best we can muster.

184
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,265
Follow me, dickholes.

185
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:51,545
Queen Margo.

186
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,615
Perhaps you can tell me
what's taking so long

187
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,885
to plant the mushroom fields.

188
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,755
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

189
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:04,425
Meanwhile,
I have a real problem.

190
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:08,665
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

191
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,965
But you can.

192
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:11,865
I don't see why
that's my problem.

193
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:14,335
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

194
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,635
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

195
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,505
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

196
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,505
'cause we can't even
defend our High King?

197
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:23,915
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

198
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,915
see what happens then.

199
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,555
Interesting argument.

200
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,015
I'll tell you what.

201
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:35,055
I can bring you there
via Pegasus,

202
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:39,025
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

203
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,995
These two need to come with.

204
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:55,705
Oh, my God...

205
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,345
Alice!

206
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,445
Daniel.

207
00:10:58,475 --> 00:10:59,845
What are you doing?

208
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,615
Mom, I don't expect
you to understand,

209
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,485
but Carol has a lamprey
inside of her

210
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:05,091
and if I don't get it out,
it'll kill all of us.

211
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,925
An old Sumerian text
suggested that

212
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,325
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

213
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:12,665
Oh, God.

214
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,695
And...

215
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,895
Oh...

216
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,965
Damn it, it's dead.

217
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:23,735
Quentin,

218
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,760
tell her to put that thing down
right this instant.

219
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,881
Your cat exploded.
What did you expect me to do?

220
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,715
Not, like, follow me home.
Jesus.

221
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,715
Cats detect lampreys
by exploding.

222
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,985
Ah!

223
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,885
All of you, stay away from me!

224
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:42,425
Oh, great.

225
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,995
Now Carol won't
come over here anymore.

226
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,725
Honey, I know
this really isn't the time,

227
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,365
but shouldn't the lamprey
have come out of Carol

228
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:50,735
after you shocked her?

229
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,581
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

230
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,465
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

231
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,105
Maybe the lamprey isn't here.

232
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,475
Yeah, well, maybe
the lamprey doesn't exist.

233
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:01,405
The lamprey exists, Mother,

234
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:02,875
and it can track long distances,

235
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,015
and it's coming for me.

236
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:08,015
You wouldn't understand.

237
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:12,925
Whatever she did, she did it
because she was a niffin.

238
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:15,555
Oh, God, Daniel,
I know she was a niffin.

239
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:18,495
I thought she was dead
for months.

240
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:19,765
Wait a second.

241
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:22,795
You thought that Carol
had this lamprey in her,

242
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,895
and you left me alone with her?

243
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:27,105
I told you to get away from her.

244
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:31,505
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

245
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:34,645
Quentin,
what's going on with your neck?

246
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,045
Honey, I thought
I saw Quentin's neck move.

247
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,945
Wait.

248
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,715
Where did Quentin get to?

249
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,615
Shit.

250
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:49,025
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

251
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:50,995
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

252
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,995
They can be most
quarrelsome creatures.

253
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,665
I smell like
a horse fucked a bird.

254
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,035
Actually,
it was the other way around.

255
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:00,465
I'm going to go
sun myself up here

256
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:02,675
while you chat
with your pirates.

257
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,175
But don't worry.

258
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:07,005
I got my eye on you.

259
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,045
Who are you lot supposed to be?

260
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:13,645
I'm High Queen Margo
the Destroyer,

261
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:15,815
and the entourage.

262
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,085
You brought a fairy with you.

263
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,155
Yes, well, most pirates
have made a fairy deal

264
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,655
at one time or another.

265
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,755
My name is Hoop,
Ms. Destroyer.

266
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:28,165
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

267
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:33,865
My queen, a word before you go?

268
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:37,135
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

269
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:38,935
around the court as pickpockets?

270
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,575
I've heard.
What's your point?

271
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,715
Um, only that
my skills in this field

272
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,115
could be useful to you.

273
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:45,191
Mm-hmm,
I'll keep an eye on my jewels.

274
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,585
Are we done here?

275
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:56,125
Are you suggesting
that you could...

276
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:58,795
Although her majesty
lacks depth perception,

277
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:02,735
she does not lack
in depth or perception.

278
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,935
You keep an eye on the pirates.

279
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,735
If anything turns up missing,

280
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,835
we'll know they're the culprits.

281
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,775
I shall catch up with you
below decks, ma'am.

282
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,715
I can't afford
even the tiniest crack.

283
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,285
When the lamprey
is outside the house,

284
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,115
it can enter through
almost any opening.

285
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,285
Why do you assume
the lamprey's even here?

286
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,555
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

287
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,925
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

288
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:36,765
You know,
without your optical spells,

289
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,035
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

290
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,805
I mean, it looked weird.

291
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,835
We can't risk it.
If the lamprey is in the house,

292
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,805
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

293
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:48,175
What if Quentin tries
to get back in here himself?

294
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,775
We could call the police.

295
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,115
They could come and
get him out of the house.

296
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:53,685
Problem solved.

297
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,021
That's a bad idea.
If it's inside Quentin,

298
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,315
who knows what he'll do?

299
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,085
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

300
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:01,925
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

301
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:04,325
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the lamprey.

302
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:07,265
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

303
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:10,195
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

304
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:12,635
I'm gonna need more wine.

305
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:15,805
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

306
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,805
No, a gun won't protect us
against a lamprey.

307
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,645
That is the only weapon
that we have,

308
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:22,045
except the battery's dead.
We need a new one.

309
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:23,315
There's a car in the garage.

310
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:26,615
Don't those use
some kind of battery?

311
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,085
The lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

312
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,925
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

313
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,595
and I'm not taking any chances.

314
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:44,835
Thank you.

315
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,365
Yeah.

316
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:49,975
You're missing the signs, Julia.

317
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,375
I thought
you'd be further along.

318
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:56,915
We're going to have to push you.

319
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:00,915
I said thank you.

320
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,655
Oh.

321
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,055
Sorry.

322
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:52,665
Alice.

323
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,865
Hey!

324
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:57,281
Don't come any closer
or I'll smash your head in!

325
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:58,905
Alice, come on!

326
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,675
I'm not the lamprey, Alice!

327
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,151
How do I know
you're not the lamprey!

328
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,691
I don't know how to prove it.
I'm just, I'm not...

329
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,415
It's... it's gone!
It left!

330
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:09,815
Ah. Ugh.

331
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:12,285
I don't know.

332
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,455
I was awake the whole time.

333
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:22,895
I could feel it controlling me
and searching my memory.

334
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:26,295
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

335
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,235
It's angry at you, Alice.

336
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:30,305
What did you do to it?

337
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:31,435
I...

338
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:32,435
I don't remember.

339
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:34,705
It's weird.

340
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,775
I could've snapped your neck
over there so easy.

341
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:40,315
And the lamprey didn't want to
for some reason.

342
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:43,455
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

343
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:46,825
I am taking
our daughter seriously.

344
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,325
Help me finish taping up
the windows, won't you?

345
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,795
Fine.

346
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,265
But wouldn't it be nice
if just once,

347
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,265
Alice would come
without bringing

348
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:58,265
all of her drama with her?

349
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,875
You gonna summon some kind of

350
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,215
chocolate-loving demon
to save my ass?

351
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:18,215
The scent of chocolate makes
them less likely to eat us.

352
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:20,785
I hope.

353
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:26,925
The only nice thing
about losing magic?

354
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,765
The radio signals
in my head went out too.

355
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:32,195
All's quiet
on the psychic front?

356
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:33,535
Yeah.

357
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,105
Could get used to that.

358
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,475
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

359
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,515
Damn.

360
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,215
You sure you wanna do this?

361
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:49,285
There's a lot of magic in that.

362
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,355
You sure you wanna
waste it on me?

363
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,255
I stole it.

364
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,785
It's my call.

365
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:57,525
You don't owe me anything, Kady.

366
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:00,965
Of course you'd say that.

367
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:04,335
You got poisoned
trying to help me.

368
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:06,195
If I didn't try to help you,
I...

369
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:09,205
I couldn't live with myself.

370
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,275
Guess I should say thanks.

371
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,105
Yeah, you should.

372
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,555
Julia will be back soon.

373
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,295
I will try

374
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:32,425
not to die.

375
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:38,465
I appreciate that.

376
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:55,415
Good job, Tick.

377
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,185
Your praise is everything,

378
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:59,455
but I would also like
a country estate.

379
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,225
Don't get greedy.

380
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:08,595
Queen Margo the Destroyer,
my king.

381
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:15,305
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

382
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:16,935
That's fine by me.

383
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:21,905
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

384
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:25,045
Maybe you and I could, uh,

385
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:29,085
take a private cabin and parlay
a thing or two on our own.

386
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,555
Yeah, I'm hot.

387
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:33,055
You're extremely hot yourself.

388
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:36,455
But you just took over
my goddamn boat,

389
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,455
which tells me you're not one

390
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,565
to pay attention to a safe word.

391
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,095
Exactly.

392
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:48,405
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

393
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,975
But, um...

394
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:52,975
you give me what I want,

395
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:56,205
I won't take anything
off the table.

396
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:58,175
Hmm.

397
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,485
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

398
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:03,415
Well,

399
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:06,585
we've all got a thing.

400
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:09,995
I need to see High King Eliot.

401
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,925
Now.

402
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,335
Mm-hmm.

403
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:28,645
My queen!

404
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,475
It is I, your High King Eliot...

405
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:34,615
In the flesh.

406
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:42,635
So, you think it left the house?

407
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,201
Yes, and we need to find
out what it really wanted

408
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:46,725
before it comes back.

409
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,441
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

410
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,135
but I was thinking
we might be better off

411
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:51,635
avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

412
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:53,335
I was thinking Asian myself.

413
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:55,435
Uh, Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

414
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:57,275
But you said it left the house.

415
00:21:57,305 --> 00:22:00,175
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

416
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:01,345
- Mom.
- Darling...

417
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,605
I have to go to the bathroom.

418
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:04,475
There's one right out there.

419
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:05,751
Don't you think
we would've heard it

420
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,085
if it had come back inside?

421
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:08,415
Mom, the lamprey is tiny,

422
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:09,761
but it is a powerful
magical creature.

423
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:11,315
Don't underestimate it.

424
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:13,725
First you said
it was inside of Carol,

425
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:15,355
so you electrocuted her.

426
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,495
Then you said
it was inside of Quentin,

427
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,025
only now he's back,

428
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:21,365
and the creature's gone
for some reason.

429
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:24,095
Am I the only one
that this sounds crazy to?

430
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,295
Stephanie, sweetheart...

431
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:27,305
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

432
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:30,405
We've both been in this room
for God knows how long,

433
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,105
and I have to pee.

434
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:34,245
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

435
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,745
Just go in the corner, Mom.

436
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:37,415
I am not peeing
in front of your father.

437
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:39,345
If I had wanted
that in my marriage,

438
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,115
I would've stayed
with Jean Claude.

439
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:42,685
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

440
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,485
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

441
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:47,655
And I am not gonna risk it
just because you think

442
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:52,525
that you stepped on
some creature's magical toes.

443
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:54,665
I didn't step on its toes.

444
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,395
I murdered its entire family.

445
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,665
I did experiments on them
to figure out

446
00:22:58,695 --> 00:22:59,807
what kind of magic they had.

447
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:02,135
That's what I did as a niffin.

448
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:04,075
Jesus, Alice.

449
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:07,405
Well, you know, we've all dealt
with our share of monsters.

450
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:08,675
You don't get it.

451
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:11,775
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

452
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:15,085
The lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

453
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:16,815
It's just the one
who got my number.

454
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:19,155
So, I wanna be absolutely clear

455
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:22,525
on who the real monster is here.

456
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,525
Excuse me.

457
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,705
That didn't really help.

458
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:38,335
I know.

459
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,805
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

460
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:44,375
Okay, I'll go after her.

461
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:46,145
Just you and your dad
keep researching.

462
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,785
My Asian languages are
for shit, anyway.

463
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:51,715
You better tape up.

464
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:52,855
Yeah.

465
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:54,725
- Just to be safe.
- Yeah.

466
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,455
So, brass tacks.

467
00:23:56,485 --> 00:24:00,195
You want 3,000
Fillorian Gold Crescents?

468
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:02,165
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

469
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:04,195
I'm crying from
my one eye for you.

470
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,795
There is, uh, one more matter.

471
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:08,865
Our ship, the Sika,

472
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,405
is a Deer Class vessel
like yours.

473
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,345
So, it's been a dry voyage.

474
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,615
It's no coincidence
we met like this.

475
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:21,215
The Sika sought out the Muntjac
after he scented her.

476
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:23,755
And now he needs her to submit.

477
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:26,585
What?

478
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:29,585
Our boat wants
to fuck your boat.

479
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,425
And we can't leave
until he does.

480
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:37,265
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

481
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:39,895
and as such,
they have the same sort of

482
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:41,765
biological urges we do.

483
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:44,335
Although, our ship
is subject to royal command.

484
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,845
Which I couldn't give,
but you can.

485
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:50,821
I just tell our boat
to spread it for their boat

486
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:53,245
and we're done?

487
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,715
What are you not telling me?

488
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,455
Well, the boat can be upset
by the experience.

489
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:00,855
They're not the same after.

490
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:04,395
Like, how?

491
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:07,195
They become distracted,
irritable.

492
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,725
Sometimes,
they can't sail right.

493
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,335
Some ships have
to be put into dry dock,

494
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,735
never to sail again.

495
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:16,165
That sounds like PTSD.

496
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:22,245
So, these pirates are asking us
to let our boat get raped?

497
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:25,645
My queen's words,
as always, are coarse,

498
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,245
but truthful.

499
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:28,715
I love this old boat,

500
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:30,955
but if they don't get
what they want,

501
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:33,325
the pirates will kill the crew.

502
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,485
That's a new look for you.

503
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,415
It's not safe in here.

504
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,415
Oh, you heard Alice.

505
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:05,855
She's the monster.

506
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:08,725
Come on, she's not
a monster, she's just...

507
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:09,785
conflicted.

508
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:15,265
It's not safe anywhere.

509
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:18,295
Did you know we got
a tax bill for the house?

510
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:20,835
Apparently,
we haven't paid in 30 years.

511
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:25,605
Enchantment failed,
so now we're losing our home.

512
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:29,745
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

513
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:32,745
I mean, get fucking jobs?

514
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:35,885
I don't even know
how to do anything.

515
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:37,515
And Daniel.

516
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,625
There's no place
for us in this world.

517
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:42,985
Sometimes I think

518
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:46,395
Charlie was the one
who got off easy.

519
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:53,665
Ah, shit.

520
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,775
I am Asteroth.

521
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:40,415
Astaroth,
Demon of the Seventh Circle,

522
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:42,515
Great Duke of The Inferno.

523
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:44,455
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

524
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:47,355
Astaroth with an A is my cousin.

525
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:48,755
You can totally stand.

526
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:52,055
The whole
kneeling thing's weird.

527
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,945
It's pretty advanced,

528
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:10,545
and it'll be tough to extract.

529
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:14,015
Though, those are the tastiest.

530
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:18,385
Surgery.

531
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,955
But it will hurt.

532
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,475
Just, save it, okay?

533
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:39,475
You'd astrally project, too.

534
00:28:39,505 --> 00:28:41,845
No shame, bro.

535
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,755
Oh, my head is swimming.

536
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,125
I can't read Chinese right now.

537
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:55,485
How do you read so fast?

538
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,985
This isn't fast.

539
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:59,031
When I was a niffin, I didn't
have to rely on my eyes.

540
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:01,065
This is like
running through water.

541
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:03,595
It's so slow.

542
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:06,495
What you said to your mother,
is that true?

543
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:10,435
What you did to that
lamprey's family?

544
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:11,935
When I was a niffin,

545
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:14,675
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

546
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,845
Wait, hold on.

547
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:24,515
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

548
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,015
It's a parasite
similar to the lamprey.

549
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:29,455
I think I know what it's doing.

550
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:39,465
I'm High Queen Margo of Fillory.

551
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,565
Your Liege.

552
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,835
I have a kind of problem.

553
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,575
See,

554
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,945
a bunch of pirates boarded you

555
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:50,045
and are threatening
to kill the crew

556
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:54,145
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

557
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:58,755
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

558
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:01,755
in a Johnny Depp sort of way,
but the fact is,

559
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:05,755
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

560
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:08,725
in a Johnny Depp sort of way.

561
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,195
Look...

562
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:14,935
I could just order you to do it,

563
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:17,875
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

564
00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:20,975
You have thoughts
and feelings...

565
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:23,205
I think.

566
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:26,615
So, I guess I'm asking...

567
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:29,785
What do you wanna do?

568
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:40,625
Maybe I'm an idiot
for even asking.

569
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:53,135
There, there.

570
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:56,975
Gonna be okay.

571
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:02,015
I mean, look at me.

572
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:03,585
I'm a mess.

573
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:06,585
I have to clean myself up.

574
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,025
I do, I have to clean myself...

575
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:12,155
What are you...
No, no, no, no.

576
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:15,995
Oh.

577
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,235
Uh, no, she was, um,

578
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:22,935
kissing me, and um, I'm just...
Stop, I'm trying to...

579
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:27,035
Oh, please, we're both adults.

580
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:28,305
You don't get to judge.

581
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,645
Step away from him, Mom.

582
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:30,845
Stephanie, do you honestly

583
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,575
have to make this about you too?

584
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,645
Oh, don't psychoanalyze me,
Daniel.

585
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,045
Back away, Mom.

586
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:37,915
- Don't raise your voice to me.
- Oh, God.

587
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:39,655
Her-her neck...
She's the lamprey.

588
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:41,855
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

589
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:43,655
I saw it.
Her neck moved.

590
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,925
I told you to back
the fuck away from him!

591
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,935
The lamprey should
leave her body.

592
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:57,635
Any moment now.

593
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:59,205
I swear to God, she kissed me.

594
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:01,005
Shut up, Quentin.

595
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,815
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

596
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:05,345
Anything's possible.

597
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,815
The lamprey
already took you over.

598
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:08,885
It doesn't wanna
kill us because it...

599
00:32:08,915 --> 00:32:12,315
wants to lay eggs inside of us.

600
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:18,725
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

601
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:20,795
until you die,
and then feeds on the carcass.

602
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:23,065
I don't understand.

603
00:32:23,095 --> 00:32:27,365
The lamprey should've
left her by now.

604
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,105
Unless it hasn't left Quentin.

605
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,835
- Oh, God.
- No.

606
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,775
He was trying to kiss her
so that the lamprey

607
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:34,075
would jump into her body.

608
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:36,105
No.

609
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:37,305
Stay away from me!

610
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:38,375
Quentin...

611
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,645
I am not the lamprey.

612
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:43,245
This isn't really
a great way to prove that.

613
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:46,985
If you're not the lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

614
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,701
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

615
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:52,295
that I'm not the lamprey,
and when I do it...

616
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:54,725
you'll know what to do.

617
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:15,215
Oh, bravo.

618
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,015
Nicely done.

619
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:18,785
You got me.

620
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:21,055
I'm gonna give you
one chance to leave my dad.

621
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:25,725
You'll kill me?

622
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,665
You killed my family.

623
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:29,025
That wasn't me.

624
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,301
I don't remember
what I did as a niffin.

625
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,665
Alice, I know you're lying.

626
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:33,195
Your father could always tell.

627
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:35,105
That little twitch you get.

628
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,775
You murdered every one
of my children

629
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:39,375
because you were
seeking knowledge.

630
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:41,775
So, what did you learn

631
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:44,775
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

632
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,075
I wanna know.

633
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:51,885
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

634
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:56,225
When they died,
they made pretty little lights.

635
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:00,965
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

636
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:06,465
It's funny the things
you can sense from the inside.

637
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:09,165
That one still loves you.

638
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:14,045
And your father
has a weak heart.

639
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:16,475
He'll die
if you try to shock me.

640
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:17,845
You don't know that.

641
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:23,245
And I'm sorry I wasn't able
to lay my eggs into her.

642
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:27,825
Since I know
how much you hate her,

643
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:30,925
it's crueler to leave her alive.

644
00:34:30,955 --> 00:34:36,395
Well, thank you
for finally being honest.

645
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:38,835
I'll let myself out.

646
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:07,865
Thank God.

647
00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:10,095
Kill it, Alice.

648
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:53,905
Congratulations.

649
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,205
Jesus Christ.

650
00:35:56,245 --> 00:35:57,915
What did you do?

651
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:01,345
I was moved by
your speech to the Muntjac,

652
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:04,355
coming to her defense.

653
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:08,525
So, I decided to intervene.

654
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:12,555
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

655
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:16,965
You stood up to them.

656
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:18,935
You were a queen.

657
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:20,965
That's who I need you to be.

658
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:25,105
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

659
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:27,075
remember this room.

660
00:36:29,475 --> 00:36:31,845
Now...

661
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,915
there's the matter
of your lying to me.

662
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:39,155
Did you think I wouldn't be
a queen with you?

663
00:36:39,185 --> 00:36:42,155
Time to give it back.

664
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:49,465
It's my eye.

665
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:51,865
It was,

666
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:56,305
but you made a deal.

667
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:59,875
Tick, Gillen, come here.

668
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:03,405
Someone has stolen
something from me.

669
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:05,275
Which one of you was it?

670
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:08,515
They didn't do this.

671
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,085
I did.

672
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:14,185
Fine, we do it your way.

673
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:19,095
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

674
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:24,265
catch a human by the... tongue.

675
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:42,945
You may go.

676
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:49,025
There is a song
he does not like,

677
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:52,225
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

678
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:54,495
He will slowly go mad,

679
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,935
then he will not be
of much use to you.

680
00:37:57,965 --> 00:37:59,565
My eye.

681
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:11,475
The eye can never be fixed.

682
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:14,115
But you can't spy on me anymore.

683
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:17,615
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

684
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:20,115
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

685
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:23,125
to think about what you've done.

686
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,465
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

687
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:32,065
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

688
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,615
What the hell
did you put in that?

689
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:48,385
It should kill any
of the eggs left inside of you.

690
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,615
Did you drink it all?

691
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:50,985
Mmm...

692
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:57,225
When you left Brakebills,

693
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:00,655
you said that
you couldn't forgive me.

694
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:03,025
Was that real?

695
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:08,605
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

696
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:12,305
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

697
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,405
From the lamprey, or...

698
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,375
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

699
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:21,385
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

700
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:24,785
sort of sleeping together,
or whenever...

701
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:27,085
There were two of us
doing that, Alice.

702
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,155
It wasn't just me.

703
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,155
Yeah, I know.

704
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:30,585
I...

705
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,195
I know that, and it felt good,

706
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:34,665
I'm not saying that it didn't,

707
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:37,465
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

708
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:41,235
I'm just...
I'm not that girl anymore.

709
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:44,405
And I can't ever be her again.
I don't know how.

710
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:46,535
I know that
I have said this before

711
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:50,045
and that it probably
sounds ridiculous.

712
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:52,415
I just wanna help.

713
00:39:53,745 --> 00:39:54,715
I really mean it.

714
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:57,785
Yeah, I know.
I know you do.

715
00:39:57,815 --> 00:40:00,455
I just...

716
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:04,055
I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

717
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:06,125
I don't know what I want.

718
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,065
That's okay.

719
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:10,165
It's confusing.

720
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:14,365
I lived this whole other life,

721
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:17,405
and a part of that is still
who I am,

722
00:40:17,435 --> 00:40:20,135
whether I like it or not.

723
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,675
But when you look at me,

724
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:28,185
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

725
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:29,585
The old Alice, like...

726
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:31,455
Like that's who
you want me to be.

727
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:33,485
She's gone.

728
00:40:35,155 --> 00:40:38,625
It's just...
It makes it too hard, Quentin.

729
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,765
Alice!

730
00:40:43,795 --> 00:40:44,865
Daniel!

731
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:47,395
Alice!

732
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:49,265
Daniel!

733
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:51,375
Oh, my God.

734
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:36,915
I think I've got it.

735
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:38,555
Ooh, it's juicy.

736
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:41,115
I'll save it for later.

737
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,895
I'll close the wound.

738
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:52,435
It may take him
some time to heal.

739
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:54,405
Thank you.

740
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:06,245
Penny?

741
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,245
Penny.

742
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:09,445
Penny?

743
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,885
Penny.

744
00:42:10,915 --> 00:42:13,485
No.

745
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:15,385
Penny, come on.

746
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:18,525
I'm sorry.

747
00:42:18,555 --> 00:42:20,295
You called me too late.

748
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:22,465
No, no, no, he can't.

749
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:23,665
No, come on, Penny.

750
00:42:23,695 --> 00:42:25,665
Don't... don't, come on.

751
00:42:25,695 --> 00:42:27,735
No.

752
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:29,335
No.

753
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,645
Shit.
