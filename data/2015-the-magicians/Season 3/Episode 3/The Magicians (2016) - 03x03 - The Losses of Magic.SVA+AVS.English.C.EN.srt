1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:01,959
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,983 --> 00:00:04,954
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,681
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

4
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:10,318
My father's dying, and
I need you to fix him.

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,555
I require someone I
trust to accompany you.

6
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,423
I'd like you to meet your daughter.

7
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:16,624
What?

8
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:18,493
Just say it. Cancer.

9
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:19,827
Call it cancer plus.

10
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,095
How long till I die?

11
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,964
No, you're not going to, okay?

12
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:26,668
Holy shit.

13
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:28,570
As a niff in, you made enemies.

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,573
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

15
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:33,575
- Who?
- The lamprey.

16
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:35,710
What do you want with
the lamprey anyway?

17
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,712
It's more what the
lamprey wants with me.

18
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:39,113
Well, if you could do magic...

19
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:40,715
Yeah, well, I can't.

20
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:42,550
You're down to an
early warning device...

21
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:44,018
an alarm, if you will.

22
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:19,987
Sorry about this.

23
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:23,891
I need your help.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,162
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

25
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:31,433
So, I'm not dead anymore.

26
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,903
Alice?

27
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,172
Shit.

28
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:41,509
Hi, Mom.

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,711
So, I'm alive.

30
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:44,779
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:47,181
Quentin called us after it happened,

32
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:49,717
and you're just visiting us now.

33
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:56,190
I've been meaning to come by...

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,925
Excuse the mess.

35
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:01,062
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

36
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,697
when magic vanished.

37
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:06,568
But then, you'd know
that if you ever called.

38
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,572
Who's she?

39
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:11,873
That's Carol.

40
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:13,541
That's Carol?

41
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:15,677
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

42
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:18,946
a lot of illusion work to
keep herself looking thin.

43
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:20,982
So, now she drinks.

44
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:22,484
Carol?

45
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:24,452
You remember my daughter, Alice?

46
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,887
She used to be dead.

47
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,689
Now she isn't.

48
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,658
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

49
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,226
And she brought a cat.

50
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:42,704
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

51
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,907
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

52
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:48,476
Kinda creeps me out every
time I pick it up, though.

53
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,911
We need a rabbit.

54
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,622
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

55
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:52,980
How close is the nearest island?

56
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,716
Beyond Fillory's territorial waters,

57
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:57,051
the islands don't like to be mapped,

58
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:59,253
so sometimes they move.

59
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:00,988
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

60
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,725
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

61
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:06,127
All hands are on deck!

62
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,641
What's going on, Admiral?

63
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,176
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

64
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,179
Pirates.

65
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,882
They're flying the red
bones, Your Majesty.

66
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,718
No quarter given.

67
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:34,021
Well, shit.

68
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:37,525
Hey, Q. Did you find Kady?

69
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:39,060
No, I struck out.

70
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,662
Yeah, so did Josh.

71
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,830
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

72
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:45,600
Do you wanna meet me here, or... ?

73
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,934
No, I... I can't.

74
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,570
I have to leave town. My dad got worse.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,204
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

76
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,173
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

77
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:53,307
Will do.

78
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,942
I should go.

79
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,621
Hi.

80
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,155
Can I come in?

81
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,290
Please?

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,826
Give me another chance.

83
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,564
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,666
He looks terrible.

85
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:22,770
And getting worse.

86
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,338
I have a ritual that could save him

87
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,040
but it requires a lot of magic,

88
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,675
so, you can participate,

89
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:30,645
or you can fuck off. Dealer's choice.

90
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,114
What's the ritual?

91
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,683
We're gonna summon a demon.

92
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:46,119
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

93
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,011
I... I don't understand.

94
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,713
What are the pirates trying to do?

95
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:06,914
Kill us and take our ship.

96
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:09,250
Are they allowed to do that?

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,985
I thought father was the king.

98
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,253
He is.

99
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,288
That's why they want to
steal from him: He's rich.

100
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,166
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

101
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:18,793
Please, Your Majesty, come with me.

102
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:26,801
What an odd way to
make a living, pirating.

103
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,002
We can make our stand here.

104
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:29,403
Fray, get behind me.

105
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,414
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

106
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,741
Please, Lady Fen, if we
fight, they'll kill us.

107
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:35,843
Plus, are we super totally sure

108
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:37,178
that talking to them won't work?

109
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,846
No, pirates take. That's what they do.

110
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,381
Will you not fight, Father?

111
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:42,183
Your father is a powerful magician,

112
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:43,685
but when magic disappeared...

113
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:45,119
Is father a coward, then?

114
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,722
Father's a survivor.

115
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,724
That's weird.

116
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:52,393
Was there always a keyhole right there?

117
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,931
Wait a second.

118
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,958
Mom, can we talk privately, please?

119
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:27,328
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

120
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,796
We were just discussing how

121
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:31,298
magic is due to come back any time now.

122
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,134
What a cute little kitten.

123
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,336
Oh.

124
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,807
- Back off, Carol!
- Alice, really?

125
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:41,709
Just stay away from her.

126
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,044
Don't be ridiculous.

127
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,879
Now, Carol is in a very fragile state...

128
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,380
You need to listen to me right now.

129
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,749
No, no, no, no.

130
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,183
You listen to me.

131
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,994
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

132
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:54,321
without any regard
for people's feelings.

133
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:55,723
Fine.

134
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:57,424
Where's Dad, then?

135
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,093
Look, all I'm saying is,

136
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:01,338
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

137
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,731
Look, I'd love to be more cautious,

138
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,099
but Penny is gonna die.

139
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,102
So, if you have a better idea right now,

140
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,771
I'm all ears.

141
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:16,844
Okay.

142
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,814
What do you need me to do?

143
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,816
I need a goat femur, pencil shavings,

144
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:24,151
and some other stuff for the summoning.

145
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:29,056
Alice.

146
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,459
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

147
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,961
When we heard, I knew that you would

148
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,429
take the time that you need, but...

149
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,064
Dad, we have to hurry.

150
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,200
There's a lamprey after me.

151
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,303
A lamprey?

152
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,805
What did you do to it?

153
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,272
It's not important, it...

154
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,875
but it's after me and
anyone connected to me,

155
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:50,878
and, look, I think it's
inside Carol right now.

156
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,413
But... Carol is with your mother.

157
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,481
And I tried to warn
her, but you know Mom.

158
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,150
If I had any magic at all,

159
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,285
I'd be able to fight it, but I don't.

160
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:00,354
So, I need your help.

161
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:01,956
Now.

162
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:03,424
Seriously, Tick?

163
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:05,026
What is the problem here?

164
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:09,096
I asked for two simple things.

165
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:13,167
Pull up the fields, plant
some goddamn mushrooms.

166
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:16,037
If you will allow me to
mansplain, Your Highness,

167
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,806
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

168
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:21,442
to throw out food and
replace it with, uh...

169
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:23,911
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

170
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:26,447
And mansplaining

171
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,482
is a bad thing, Tick.

172
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,819
But I'm a man... explaining.

173
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,254
Is that not mansplaining?

174
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,156
Perhaps you could woman-splain it to me.

175
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,525
It's not me. It's the fucking fairies.

176
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,361
This is more of their bullshit.

177
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:42,596
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,

178
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,999
and now mushroom fields.

179
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,002
I just need it done. Okay?

180
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:50,905
The queen will not be pleased.

181
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:54,842
Are the fairies here right now?

182
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:56,944
They were.

183
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,412
Now they've gone to tell the queen

184
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,547
that we screwed the
pooch right in the pooper.

185
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,883
That sounds painful.

186
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:02,913
It is.

187
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:04,451
Your Highness!

188
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:06,954
We just a received a
report from the seagulls

189
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:09,190
that the Muntjac has
been captured by pirates.

190
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,958
Two days' sail from After Island.

191
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:14,228
Son of a twat.

192
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:17,965
Tick, what is the
fastest boat in our Navy?

193
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:19,266
The Morgan Downs, ma'am,

194
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,268
could reach the Muntjac in a week.

195
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,105
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

196
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:29,076
No, it is not the best we can muster.

197
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:31,913
Follow me, dickholes.

198
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:45,191
Queen Margo.

199
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:49,263
Perhaps you can tell
me what's taking so long

200
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:51,532
to plant the mushroom fields.

201
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,402
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

202
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,072
Meanwhile, I have a real problem.

203
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:02,309
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

204
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,610
But you can.

205
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,512
I don't see why that's my problem.

206
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,982
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

207
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,284
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

208
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:13,154
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

209
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,156
'cause we can't even
defend our High King?

210
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:17,558
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

211
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:20,561
see what happens then.

212
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,197
Interesting argument.

213
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,665
I'll tell you what.

214
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:28,702
I can bring you there via Pegasus,

215
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:32,673
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

216
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:34,141
When do we leave?

217
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,645
These two need to come with.

218
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,356
Oh, my God...

219
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,992
Alice!

220
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,093
Daniel.

221
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,494
What are you doing?

222
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:55,262
Mom, I don't expect you to understand,

223
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,131
but Carol has a lamprey inside of her

224
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,741
and if I don't get it
out, it'll kill all of us.

225
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,567
An old Sumerian text suggested that

226
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:03,971
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

227
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,307
Oh, God.

228
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:07,341
And...

229
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:08,409
What are you doing?

230
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,546
Oh...

231
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:15,616
Damn it, it's dead.

232
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:17,384
Quentin,

233
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,329
tell her to put that thing
down right this instant.

234
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,055
What are you doing here?

235
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,532
Your cat exploded. What
did you expect me to do?

236
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:24,358
Not, like, follow me home. Jesus.

237
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:26,093
Hold on, your cat exploded?

238
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,362
Cats detect lampreys by exploding.

239
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,631
Ah!

240
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:33,534
All of you, stay away from me!

241
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:36,070
Oh, great.

242
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,639
Now Carol won't come over here anymore.

243
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,374
Honey, I know this
really isn't the time,

244
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:43,010
but shouldn't the lamprey
have come out of Carol

245
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,378
after you shocked her?

246
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:46,223
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

247
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:49,116
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

248
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:50,751
Maybe the lamprey isn't here.

249
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah, well, maybe the
lamprey doesn't exist.

250
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:55,056
The lamprey exists, Mother,

251
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,523
and it can track long distances,

252
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:57,658
and it's coming for me.

253
00:11:57,688 --> 00:12:00,327
Why, what did you do to it?

254
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,662
You wouldn't understand.

255
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,564
Why don't you just try me?

256
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:06,567
Whatever she did, she did
it because she was a niff in.

257
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:09,203
Oh, God, Daniel, I
know she was a niff in.

258
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:12,139
I thought she was dead for months.

259
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,407
Wait a second.

260
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:16,443
You thought that Carol
had this lamprey in her,

261
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,545
and you left me alone with her?

262
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,747
I told you to get away from her.

263
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:25,152
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

264
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:28,289
Quentin, what's going on with your neck?

265
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,324
What do you mean?

266
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,693
Honey, I thought I saw
Quentin's neck move.

267
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:34,595
- What?
- Wait.

268
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,363
Where did Quentin get to?

269
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,265
Shit.

270
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:42,669
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

271
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,638
is so persuasive with the Pegasi.

272
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:46,640
They can be most quarrelsome creatures.

273
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,310
I smell like a horse fucked a bird.

274
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,678
Actually, it was the other way around.

275
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,115
I'm going to go sun myself up here

276
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:56,317
while you chat with your pirates.

277
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:57,818
But don't worry.

278
00:12:57,848 --> 00:13:00,654
I got my eye on you.

279
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,691
Who are you lot supposed to be?

280
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:07,294
I'm High Queen Margo the Destroyer,

281
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,463
and the entourage.

282
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,731
You brought a fairy with you.

283
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,466
You can see her?

284
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,801
Yes, well, most pirates
have made a fairy deal

285
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,303
at one time or another.

286
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,405
My name is Hoop, Ms. Destroyer.

287
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:21,808
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

288
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:27,514
My queen, a word before you go?

289
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:30,784
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

290
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,586
around the court as pickpockets?

291
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:34,221
I've heard. What's your point?

292
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:36,357
Um, only that my skills in this field

293
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,758
could be useful to you.

294
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:38,835
Mm-hmm, I'll keep an eye on my jewels.

295
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:41,228
Are we done here?

296
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,770
Are you suggesting that you could...

297
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,439
Although her majesty
lacks depth perception,

298
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,377
she does not lack in
depth or perception.

299
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:59,580
You keep an eye on the pirates.

300
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,382
If anything turns up missing,

301
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,484
we'll know they're the culprits.

302
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:07,421
I shall catch up with
you below decks, ma'am.

303
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,927
What on Earth are you doing?

304
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:16,363
I can't afford even the tiniest crack.

305
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,931
When the lamprey is outside the house,

306
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:19,766
it can enter through almost any opening.

307
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:21,935
Why do you assume the
lamprey's even here?

308
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,205
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

309
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:26,573
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

310
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,675
You really saw his neck move?

311
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:30,411
You know, without your optical spells,

312
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,679
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

313
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,448
I mean, it looked weird.

314
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:36,483
We can't risk it. If the
lamprey is in the house,

315
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:39,453
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

316
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:41,822
What if Quentin tries to
get back in here himself?

317
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,424
We could call the police.

318
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,759
They could come and get
him out of the house.

319
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,328
Problem solved.

320
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,671
That's a bad idea. If
it's inside Quentin,

321
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:49,963
who knows what he'll do?

322
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:51,732
They'll end up shooting him dead.

323
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:55,569
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

324
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:57,971
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the lamprey.

325
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,907
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

326
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:03,844
a possessed cop with a
gun trying to kill us.

327
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm gonna need more wine.

328
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,450
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

329
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,452
No, a gun won't protect
us against a lamprey.

330
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,287
That is the only weapon that we have,

331
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,689
except the battery's
dead. We need a new one.

332
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,957
There's a car in the garage.

333
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:20,261
Don't those use some kind of battery?

334
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,266
Okay, now what are you doing?

335
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:27,734
The lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

336
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:30,571
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

337
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:33,240
and I'm not taking any chances.

338
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:38,479
Thank you.

339
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,013
Yeah.

340
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:43,617
You're missing the signs, Julia.

341
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:44,851
What?

342
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:47,020
I thought you'd be further along.

343
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,557
We're going to have to push you.

344
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:53,394
What are you talking about?

345
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:54,561
I said thank you.

346
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:56,297
Oh.

347
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,698
Sorry.

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,438
Alice.

349
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,641
Hey!

350
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,052
Don't come any closer or
I'll smash your head in!

351
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:51,678
Alice, come on!

352
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,446
I'm not the lamprey, Alice!

353
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:54,923
How do I know you're not the lamprey!

354
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:56,459
I don't know how to prove
it. I'm just, I'm not...

355
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,184
it's... it's gone! It left!

356
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,852
What?

357
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,589
Ah. Ugh.

358
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,790
Why did it leave you?

359
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,057
I don't know.

360
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,231
I was awake the whole time.

361
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,668
I could feel it controlling
me and searching my memory.

362
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,071
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

363
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:21,007
It's angry at you, Alice.

364
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,075
What did you do to it?

365
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,210
I...

366
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
I don't remember.

367
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:27,480
It's weird.

368
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:30,550
I could've snapped your
neck over there so easy.

369
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,085
And the lamprey didn't
want to for some reason.

370
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:36,222
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

371
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:39,592
I am taking our daughter seriously.

372
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:42,094
Help me finish taping up
the windows, won't you?

373
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,563
Fine.

374
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:46,032
But wouldn't it be nice if just once,

375
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,034
Alice would come without bringing

376
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:51,037
all of her drama with her?

377
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,648
What's with the candy?

378
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,650
You gonna summon some kind of

379
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,985
chocolate-loving demon to save my ass?

380
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:10,990
The scent of chocolate makes
them less likely to eat us.

381
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,560
I hope.

382
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,699
The only nice thing about losing magic?

383
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:22,535
The radio signals in
my head went out too.

384
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,971
All's quiet on the psychic front?

385
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,305
Yeah.

386
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,875
Could get used to that.

387
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:34,246
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

388
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,284
Damn.

389
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:39,986
You sure you wanna do this?

390
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,054
There's a lot of magic in that.

391
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:44,123
You sure you wanna waste it on me?

392
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:46,025
I stole it.

393
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,560
It's my call.

394
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:50,296
You don't owe me anything, Kady.

395
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:53,733
Of course you'd say that.

396
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:57,103
You got poisoned trying to help me.

397
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,971
If I didn't try to help you, I...

398
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:01,974
I couldn't live with myself.

399
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,043
Guess I should say thanks.

400
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,878
Yeah, you should.

401
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,327
Julia will be back soon.

402
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:24,063
I will try

403
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:25,197
not to die.

404
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:31,237
I appreciate that.

405
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,187
Good job, Tick.

406
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:49,956
Your praise is everything,

407
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:52,224
but I would also like a country estate.

408
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,994
Don't get greedy.

409
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:01,367
Queen Margo the Destroyer, my king.

410
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,970
You're the pirate king?

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,074
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

412
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:09,709
That's fine by me.

413
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:14,681
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

414
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:17,817
Maybe you and I could, uh,

415
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:21,854
take a private cabin and parlay
a thing or two on our own.

416
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:23,322
Yeah, I'm hot.

417
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,825
You're extremely hot yourself.

418
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:29,228
But you just took over my goddamn boat,

419
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,230
which tells me you're not one

420
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,332
to pay attention to a safe word.

421
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,167
What's a safe word?

422
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,869
Exactly.

423
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,173
I'm here on business, not pleasure.

424
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:42,742
But, um...

425
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:45,745
you give me what I want,

426
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:48,981
I won't take anything off the table.

427
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,950
Hmm.

428
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,253
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

429
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:56,188
Well,

430
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,358
we've all got a thing.

431
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,762
I need to see High King Eliot.

432
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,697
Now.

433
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:11,103
Mm-hmm.

434
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,413
My queen!

435
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,249
It is I, your High King Eliot...

436
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,386
In the flesh.

437
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,377
So, you think it left the house?

438
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:36,464
Yes, and we need to find
out what it really wanted

439
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:37,998
before it comes back.

440
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:39,709
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

441
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,402
but I was thinking
we might be better off

442
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,903
avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

443
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,605
I was thinking Asian myself.

444
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,707
Uh, Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

445
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,542
But you said it left the house.

446
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,445
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

447
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,613
- Mom.
- Darling...

448
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:53,881
I have to go to the bathroom.

449
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,749
There's one right out there.

450
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,026
Don't you think we would've heard it

451
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,352
if it had come back inside?

452
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,687
Mom, the lamprey is tiny,

453
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:01,030
but it is a powerful magical creature.

454
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:02,590
Don't underestimate it.

455
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,992
First you said it was inside of Carol,

456
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:06,627
so you electrocuted her.

457
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,762
Then you said it was inside of Quentin,

458
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:10,298
only now he's back,

459
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,633
and the creature's gone for some reason.

460
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:15,369
Am I the only one that
this sounds crazy to?

461
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,570
Stephanie, sweetheart...

462
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,572
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

463
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,675
We've both been in this
room for God knows how long,

464
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,377
and I have to pee.

465
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,513
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

466
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,014
Just go in the corner, Mom.

467
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,682
I am not peeing in front of your father.

468
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:30,618
If I had wanted that in my marriage,

469
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,386
I would've stayed with Jean Claude.

470
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,954
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

471
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,757
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

472
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,926
And I am not gonna risk
it just because you think

473
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:43,797
that you stepped on some
creature's magical toes.

474
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:45,933
I didn't step on its toes.

475
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:47,668
I murdered its entire family.

476
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,937
I did experiments on them to figure out

477
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,080
what kind of magic they had.

478
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:53,407
That's what I did as a niff in.

479
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,343
Jesus, Alice.

480
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,679
Well, you know, we've all dealt
with our share of monsters.

481
00:22:58,709 --> 00:22:59,947
You don't get it.

482
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:03,050
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

483
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,354
The lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

484
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,088
It's just the one who got my number.

485
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:10,424
So, I wanna be absolutely clear

486
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,794
on who the real monster is here.

487
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:17,798
Excuse me.

488
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:27,975
That didn't really help.

489
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:29,610
I know.

490
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,080
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

491
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,649
Okay, I'll go after her.

492
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,418
Just you and your dad keep researching.

493
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:41,054
My Asian languages are for shit, anyway.

494
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,990
You better tape up.

495
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,124
Yeah.

496
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,993
- Just to be safe.
- Yeah.

497
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,728
So, brass tacks.

498
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,465
You want 3,000 Fillorian Gold Crescents?

499
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,434
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

500
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:55,469
I'm crying from my one eye for you.

501
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,071
There is, uh, one more matter.

502
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,140
Our ship, the Sika,

503
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,676
is a Deer Class vessel like yours.

504
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,613
- So?
- So, it's been a dry voyage.

505
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:08,882
It's no coincidence we met like this.

506
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:12,486
The Sika sought out the
Muntjac after he scented her.

507
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,022
And now he needs her to submit.

508
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:17,858
What?

509
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:20,861
Our boat wants to fuck your boat.

510
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,697
And we can't leave until he does.

511
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:28,536
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

512
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:31,171
and as such, they have the same sort of

513
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,040
biological urges we do.

514
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,609
Although, our ship is
subject to royal command.

515
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,112
Which I couldn't give, but you can.

516
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,814
So, what?

517
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,091
I just tell our boat to
spread it for their boat

518
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:44,518
and we're done?

519
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,986
What are you not telling me?

520
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:49,723
Well, the boat can be
upset by the experience.

521
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,125
They're not the same after.

522
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,194
Not the same?

523
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,663
Like, how?

524
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:58,466
They become distracted, irritable.

525
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,000
Sometimes, they can't sail right.

526
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,603
Some ships have to be put into dry dock,

527
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:04,004
never to sail again.

528
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:07,441
That sounds like PTSD.

529
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:13,514
So, these pirates are asking
us to let our boat get raped?

530
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:16,917
My queen's words, as always, are coarse,

531
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:18,519
but truthful.

532
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:19,987
I love this old boat,

533
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:22,222
but if they don't get what they want,

534
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:24,592
the pirates will kill the crew.

535
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:51,752
That's a new look for you.

536
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:53,697
Would you come back with
me? It's not safe in here.

537
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,689
Oh, you heard Alice.

538
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,124
She's the monster.

539
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,993
Come on, she's not a
monster, she's just...

540
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,061
conflicted.

541
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,063
What's it matter?

542
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:06,534
It's not safe anywhere.

543
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,570
Did you know we got a
tax bill for the house?

544
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,105
Apparently, we haven't paid in 30 years.

545
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:16,877
Enchantment failed, so
now we're losing our home.

546
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:21,014
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

547
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:24,017
I mean, get fucking jobs?

548
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:27,154
I don't even know how to do anything.

549
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,789
And Daniel.

550
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,892
There's no place for us in this world.

551
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,261
Sometimes I think

552
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,665
Charlie was the one who got off easy.

553
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,938
Ah, shit.

554
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:26,046
I am Asteroth.

555
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:31,685
Astaroth, Demon of the Seventh Circle,

556
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,787
Great Duke of The Inferno.

557
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,723
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

558
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:38,626
Astaroth with an A is my cousin.

559
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,027
You can totally stand.

560
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:43,330
The whole kneeling thing's weird.

561
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,212
It's pretty advanced,

562
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,815
and it'll be tough to extract.

563
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,285
Though, those are the tastiest.

564
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,655
Can you do anything?

565
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,657
Surgery.

566
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,225
But it will hurt.

567
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:28,742
Just, save it, okay?

568
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,744
You'd astrally project, too.

569
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,113
No shame, bro.

570
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,773
Oh, my head is swimming.

571
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:45,142
I can't read Chinese right now.

572
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,510
How do you read so fast?

573
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,011
This isn't fast.

574
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,056
When I was a niff in, I
didn't have to rely on my eyes.

575
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:52,082
This is like running through water.

576
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:54,618
It's so slow.

577
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,521
What you said to your
mother, is that true?

578
00:28:57,552 --> 00:29:01,459
What you did to that lamprey's family?

579
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,960
When I was a niff in,

580
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,696
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

581
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:09,867
Wait, hold on.

582
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:11,669
What is it?

583
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:15,539
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

584
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,041
It's a parasite similar to the lamprey.

585
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:20,478
I think I know what it's doing.

586
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:26,950
So, um, Muntjac?

587
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:30,488
I'm High Queen Margo of Fillory.

588
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,590
Your Liege.

589
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,858
I have a kind of problem.

590
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:36,594
See,

591
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,962
a bunch of pirates boarded you

592
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:41,064
and are threatening to kill the crew

593
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:45,168
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

594
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:49,773
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

595
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,776
in a Johnny Depp sort
of way, but the fact is,

596
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:56,780
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

597
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,750
in a Johnny Depp sort of way.

598
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:04,221
Look...

599
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:05,956
I could just order you to do it,

600
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,892
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

601
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,995
You have thoughts and feelings...

602
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:14,231
I think.

603
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:17,635
So, I guess I'm asking...

604
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,804
What do you wanna do?

605
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:31,649
Maybe I'm an idiot for even asking.

606
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:44,161
There, there.

607
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,998
Gonna be okay.

608
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:53,036
I mean, look at me.

609
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:54,605
I'm a mess.

610
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,608
I have to clean myself up.

611
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:00,043
I do, I have to clean myself...

612
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,180
What are you... no, no, no, no.

613
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:07,017
Oh.

614
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,085
What the hell?

615
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:10,253
Uh, no, she was, um,

616
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:13,957
kissing me, and um, I'm
just... stop, I'm trying to...

617
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:18,061
Oh, please, we're both adults.

618
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:19,329
You don't get to judge.

619
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,664
Step away from him, Mom.

620
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:21,865
Stephanie, do you honestly

621
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,601
have to make this about you too?

622
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,669
Oh, don't psychoanalyze me, Daniel.

623
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,070
Back away, Mom.

624
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,939
- Don't raise your voice to me.
- Oh, God.

625
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,674
Her... her neck... she's the lamprey.

626
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,876
What? Oh, don't be ridiculous.

627
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:34,678
I saw it. Her neck moved.

628
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,947
I told you to back
the fuck away from him!

629
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,087
What?

630
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:46,957
The lamprey should leave her body.

631
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:48,659
Any moment now.

632
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,227
I swear to God, she kissed me.

633
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:52,029
Shut up, Quentin.

634
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:54,832
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

635
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,366
Anything's possible.

636
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:57,835
The lamprey already took you over.

637
00:31:57,865 --> 00:31:59,903
It doesn't wanna kill us because it...

638
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:03,340
wants to lay eggs inside of us.

639
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,009
And then what?

640
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:09,747
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

641
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,815
until you die, and then
feeds on the carcass.

642
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,084
I don't understand.

643
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:18,388
The lamprey should've left her by now.

644
00:32:18,418 --> 00:32:20,123
Unless it hasn't left Quentin.

645
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:21,859
- Oh, God.
- No.

646
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:23,794
He was trying to kiss
her so that the lamprey

647
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:25,095
would jump into her body.

648
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,130
No.

649
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,331
Stay away from me!

650
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:29,399
Quentin...

651
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:31,669
I am not the lamprey.

652
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,271
This isn't really a
great way to prove that.

653
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:38,008
If you're not the lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

654
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:39,719
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

655
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,313
that I'm not the lamprey,
and when I do it...

656
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:45,749
you'll know what to do.

657
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:06,236
Oh, bravo.

658
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,038
Nicely done.

659
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:09,807
You got me.

660
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:12,075
I'm gonna give you one
chance to leave my dad.

661
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:13,811
Or what?

662
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:16,747
You'll kill me?

663
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,682
You killed my family.

664
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,050
That wasn't me.

665
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,327
I don't remember what
I did as a niff in.

666
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:22,686
Alice, I know you're lying.

667
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,221
Your father could always tell.

668
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,123
That little twitch you get.

669
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:28,792
You murdered every one of my children

670
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:30,393
because you were seeking knowledge.

671
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:32,796
So, what did you learn

672
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,799
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

673
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,101
I wanna know.

674
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,906
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

675
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:47,244
When they died, they
made pretty little lights.

676
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:51,982
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

677
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,487
It's funny the things you
can sense from the inside.

678
00:33:57,517 --> 00:34:00,190
That one still loves you.

679
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,062
And your father has a weak heart.

680
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,497
He'll die if you try to shock me.

681
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:08,866
You don't know that.

682
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:10,367
You really wanna risk it?

683
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:14,271
And I'm sorry I wasn't able
to lay my eggs into her.

684
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:18,842
Since I know how much you hate her,

685
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:21,945
it's crueler to leave her alive.

686
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:27,417
Well, thank you for
finally being honest.

687
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,853
I'll let myself out.

688
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,882
Thank God.

689
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:01,118
Kill it, Alice.

690
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,928
Congratulations.

691
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,230
Jesus Christ.

692
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:47,932
What did you do?

693
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:51,369
I was moved by your
speech to the Muntjac,

694
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,372
coming to her defense.

695
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,542
So, I decided to intervene.

696
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,580
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

697
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,249
What?

698
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,985
You stood up to them.

699
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:08,953
You were a queen.

700
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:10,989
That's who I need you to be.

701
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:15,126
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

702
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:17,095
remember this room.

703
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,866
Now...

704
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:24,936
there's the matter of your lying to me.

705
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:29,173
Did you think I wouldn't
be a queen with you?

706
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,176
Time to give it back.

707
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:39,483
It's my eye.

708
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,886
It was,

709
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:46,324
but you made a deal.

710
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:49,894
Tick, Gillen, come here.

711
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,431
Someone has stolen something from me.

712
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,299
Which one of you was it?

713
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,536
They didn't do this.

714
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,104
I did.

715
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:04,208
Fine, we do it your way.

716
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:09,113
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

717
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:14,285
catch a human by the... tongue.

718
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,971
You may go.

719
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,241
What did you do?

720
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:39,043
There is a song he does not like,

721
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:42,246
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

722
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:44,515
He will slowly go mad,

723
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:47,952
then he will not be of much use to you.

724
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:49,587
My eye.

725
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,499
The eye can never be fixed.

726
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,135
But you can't spy on me anymore.

727
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:07,638
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

728
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:10,141
You have a week's
sail back to Whitespire

729
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:13,144
to think about what you've done.

730
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,483
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

731
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,086
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

732
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:35,633
What the hell did you put in that?

733
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,402
It should kill any of the
eggs left inside of you.

734
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,637
Did you drink it all?

735
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,005
Mmm

736
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:47,245
When you left Brakebills,

737
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:50,681
you said that you couldn't forgive me.

738
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,051
Was that real?

739
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,054
Didn't it feel real?

740
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,622
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

741
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:02,326
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

742
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:06,430
From the lamprey, or...

743
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,399
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

744
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,402
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

745
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,805
sort of sleeping
together, or whenever...

746
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,108
There were two of us doing that, Alice.

747
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,176
It wasn't just me.

748
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:19,206
Yeah, I know.

749
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,611
I...

750
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,214
I know that, and it felt good,

751
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:24,682
I'm not saying that it didn't,

752
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:27,485
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

753
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,255
I'm just... I'm not that girl anymore.

754
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,425
And I can't ever be her
again. I don't know how.

755
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,560
I know that I have said this before

756
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:40,064
and that it probably sounds ridiculous.

757
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:42,433
I just wanna help.

758
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:44,764
I really mean it.

759
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,805
Yeah, I know. I know you do.

760
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,474
I just...

761
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:54,078
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

762
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:56,147
I don't know what I want.

763
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:58,082
That's okay.

764
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:00,184
It's confusing.

765
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:04,388
I lived this whole other life,

766
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:07,425
and a part of that is still who I am,

767
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:10,161
whether I like it or not.

768
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:12,696
But when you look at me,

769
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:18,202
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

770
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,603
The old Alice, like...

771
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,472
like that's who you want me to be.

772
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,507
She's gone.

773
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,646
It's just... it makes
it too hard, Quentin.

774
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:33,784
Alice!

775
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:34,885
Daniel!

776
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,421
Alice!

777
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:39,290
Daniel!

778
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,392
Oh, my God.

779
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:26,937
I think I've got it.

780
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,572
Ooh, it's juicy.

781
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:31,141
I'll save it for later.

782
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,916
I'll close the wound.

783
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:42,453
It may take him some time to heal.

784
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:44,422
Thank you.

785
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:56,267
Penny?

786
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,269
Penny.

787
00:41:58,299 --> 00:41:59,470
Penny?

788
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,904
Penny.

789
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,507
No.

790
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:05,409
Penny, come on.

791
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,546
I'm sorry.

792
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,314
You called me too late.

793
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,483
No, no, no, he can't.

794
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:13,684
No, come on, Penny.

795
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,686
Don't... don't, come on.

796
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,755
No.

797
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,357
No.

798
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:29,667
Shit.
