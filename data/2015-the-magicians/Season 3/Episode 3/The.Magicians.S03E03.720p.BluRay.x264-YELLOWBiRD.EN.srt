1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,746
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,795
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,417
<i>The Tale of the Seven Keys.</i>

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,377
My father's dying,
and I need you to fix him.

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,675
<i>I require someone I trust to accompany you.</i>

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,506
I'd like you to meet
your daughter.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,761
What?

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,592
<i>Just say it. Cancer.</i>

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,018
<i>Call it cancer plus.</i>

10
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,345
How long till I die?

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,180
No, you're not going to, okay?

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,812
Holy shit.

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,690
<i>As a Niffin, you made enemies.</i>

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,693
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

15
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,695
- Who?
- The Lamprey.

16
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,868
What do you want with the
Lamprey anyway?

17
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,866
It's more what
the Lamprey wants with me.

18
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,367
Well, if you could do magic...

19
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,868
Yeah, well, I can't.

20
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,123
You're down to an early warning device...
An alarm, if you will.

21
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,247
Help you?

22
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,203
Sorry about this.

23
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,081
I need your help.

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,416
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

25
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,463
So, I'm not dead anymore.

26
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,510
Alice?

27
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:37,883
Shit.

28
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,927
Hi, Mom.

29
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,469
So, I'm alive.

30
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,929
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,893
Quentin called us after it happened,
and you're just visiting us now.

32
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,360
I've been meaning to come by...

33
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,116
Excuse the mess.

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,286
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

35
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,829
when magic vanished.

36
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,953
But then, you'd know that
if you ever called.

37
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,663
Who's she?

38
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,043
That's Carol.

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,624
That's Carol?

40
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,801
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

41
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,130
a lot of illusion work
to keep herself looking thin.

42
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,759
So, now she drinks.

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,136
Carol?

44
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,092
You remember my daughter, Alice?

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,977
She used to be dead.

46
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,180
Now she isn't.

47
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,266
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,476
And she brought a cat.

49
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,820
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

50
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,078
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,534
Kinda creeps me out every time
I pick it up, though.

52
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,085
We need a rabbit.

53
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,774
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

54
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,164
How close is the nearest island?

55
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,964
Beyond Fillory's
territorial waters,

56
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,259
the islands
don't like to be mapped,

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,507
so sometimes they move.

58
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,241
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

59
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,848
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,348
- Mmm.
- All hands on deck!

61
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,740
What's going on, Admiral?

62
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,658
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

63
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,576
Pirates.

64
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,786
They're flying the red bones,
Your Majesty.

65
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,742
No quarter given.

66
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,124
Well, shit.

67
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,587
Hey, Q. Did you find Kady?

68
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,259
No, I struck out.

69
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,756
<i>Yeah, so did Josh.</i>

70
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,964
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

71
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,678
Do you wanna meet me here, or...

72
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,100
<i>No, I can't.</i>

73
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,706
I have to leave town.
My dad got worse.

74
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,437
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

75
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,389
<i>Let me know if you
need anything, okay?</i>

76
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,564
Will do.

77
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,767
I should go.

78
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,704
Hi.

79
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,789
Can I come in?

80
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,539
Please?

81
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,991
Give me another chance.

82
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,788
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,002
He looks terrible.

84
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,129
And getting worse.

85
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,215
I have a ritual that could save him
but it requires a lot of magic,

86
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,222
so, you can participate,
or you can fuck off.

87
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,723
Dealer's choice.

88
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,929
What's the ritual?

89
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,810
We're gonna summon a demon.

90
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,173
I don't understand.

91
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,799
What are the pirates
trying to do?

92
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,051
Kill us and take our ship.

93
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,474
Are they allowed to do that?

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,142
I thought father was the King.

95
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,470
He is.

96
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,523
That's why they want
to steal from him. He's rich.

97
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,502
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

98
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,233
Please, Your Majesty,
come with me.

99
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,901
What an odd way
to make a living, pirating.

100
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,155
We can make our stand here.

101
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,657
Fray, get behind me.

102
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,725
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

103
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,832
Please, Lady Fen,
if we fight, they'll kill us.

104
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,377
Plus, are we super totally sure
that talking to them won't work?

105
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,954
No, pirates take.
That's what they do.

106
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,630
Will you not fight, Father?

107
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,754
Your father is a powerful Magician,
but when magic disappeared...

108
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,302
Is father a coward, then?

109
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,004
Father's a survivor.

110
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,176
That's weird.

111
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,635
Was there always
a keyhole right there?

112
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,896
Wait a second.

113
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,082
Mom, can we
talk privately, please?

114
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,544
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

115
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,507
We were just discussing how magic
is due to come back anytime now.

116
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,308
What a cute little kitten.

117
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,137
Oh. Oh!

118
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,847
Back off, Carol!

119
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,897
Alice, really?

120
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,771
Just stay away from her.

121
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,193
Don't be ridiculous.

122
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,986
Now, Carol is in
a very fragile state...

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,608
You need to listen
to me right now.

124
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,815
No, no, no, no.

125
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,909
You listen to me.

126
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,118
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

127
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,786
without any regard
for people's feelings.

128
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,785
Fine.

129
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,991
Where's Dad, then?

130
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,243
Look, all I'm saying is,

131
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,577
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

132
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,250
Look, I'd love to be more cautious,
but Penny is gonna die.

133
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,462
So, if you have a better idea
right now, I'm all ears.

134
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,727
Okay.

135
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,603
What do you need me to do?

136
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:25,352
I need a goat femur, pencil shavings,
and some other stuff for the summoning.

137
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,193
Oh, Alice.

138
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,697
I am so glad to see you.

139
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,655
When we heard, I knew that you would
take the time that you need, but...

140
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,205
Dad, we have to hurry.

141
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,907
There's a Lamprey after me.

142
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,458
A Lamprey?

143
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,874
What did you do to it?

144
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,456
It's not important, it...

145
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,962
But it's after me
and anyone connected to me,

146
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,965
and, look, I think
it's inside Carol right now.

147
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,637
But... Carol
is with your mother.

148
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,715
And I tried to warn her,
but you know Mom.

149
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,473
If I had any magic at all,
I'd be able to fight it, but I don't.

150
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,600
So, I need your help. Now.

151
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,640
Seriously, Tick?

152
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,145
What is the problem here?

153
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,230
I asked for two simple things.

154
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,317
Pull up the fields,
plant some goddamn mushrooms.

155
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,154
If you will allow me
to mansplain, Your Highness,

156
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,864
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

157
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,666
to throw out food
and replace it with...

158
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,994
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

159
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:29,708
And mansplaining
is a bad thing, Tick.

160
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,885
But I'm a man... Explaining.

161
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,428
Is that not mansplaining?

162
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,301
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

163
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,759
It's not me.
It's the fucking fairies.

164
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,560
This is more of their bullshit.

165
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:46,107
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,
and now mushroom fields.

166
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,105
I just need it done. Okay?

167
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,983
The Queen will not be pleased.

168
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,908
Are the fairies here right now?

169
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,030
They were.

170
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,612
Now they've gone
to tell the Queen

171
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,789
that we screwed the pooch
right in the pooper.

172
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,958
- That sounds painful.
- It is.

173
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,660
Your Highness!

174
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,041
We just received
a report from the seagulls

175
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,339
that the <i>Muntjac</i> has
been captured by pirates.

176
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,041
Two days' sail
from After Island.

177
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,502
Son of a twat.

178
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,056
Tick, what is the fastest
boat in our Navy?

179
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,431
The <i>Morgan Downs,</i> ma'am,
could reach the <i>Muntjac</i> in a week.

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,228
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

181
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,480
No, it is not
the best we can muster.

182
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,611
Follow me, dickholes.

183
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,984
Did she call us "dickholes"?

184
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,077
Queen Margo.

185
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,755
Perhaps you can tell me
what's taking so long

186
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,083
to plant the mushroom fields.

187
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,840
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

188
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,506
Meanwhile, I have
a real problem.

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,810
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

190
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,182
But you can.

191
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,059
I don't see
why that's my problem.

192
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,391
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

193
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,772
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

194
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,605
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

195
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,610
'cause we can't even
defend our high king?

196
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,113
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

197
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,614
see what happens then.

198
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,993
Interesting argument.

199
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,241
I'll tell you what.

200
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,169
I can bring you there
via <i>Pegasus,</i>

201
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,250
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

202
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,584
When do we leave?

203
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,595
These two need to come with.

204
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,853
Oh, my God...

205
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,400
Alice!

206
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,522
Daniel.

207
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,023
What are you doing?

208
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,573
Mom, I don't expect you to understand,
but Carol has a Lamprey inside of her

209
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,387
and if I don't get it out,
it'll kill all of us.

210
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,118
An old Sumerian text
suggested that

211
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,368
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

212
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,868
Oh, God.

213
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,835
And...

214
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,919
What are you doing?

215
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,121
Oh...

216
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,004
Damn it, it's dead.

217
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,633
Quentin, tell her to put that
thing down right this instant.

218
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,723
What are you doing here?

219
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,368
Your cat exploded.
What did you expect me to do?

220
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,759
Not, like, follow me home.
Jesus.

221
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,518
Hold on, your cat exploded?

222
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,847
Cats detect Lampreys
by exploding.

223
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,484
All of you, stay away from me!

224
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,066
Oh, great.

225
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,190
Now Carol won't come
over here anymore.

226
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,884
Honey, I know
this really isn't the time,

227
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,866
but shouldn't the Lamprey have come
out of Carol after you shocked her?

228
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,726
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

229
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,538
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

230
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,335
Maybe the Lamprey isn't here.

231
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,538
Yeah, well, maybe
the Lamprey doesn't exist.

232
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,046
The Lamprey exists, Mother,
and it can track long distances,

233
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,216
and it's coming for me.

234
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,795
Why, what did you do to it?

235
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,221
You wouldn't understand.

236
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,094
Why don't you just try me?

237
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,097
Whatever she did, she did it
because she was a Niffin.

238
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,645
Oh, God, Daniel, I know
she was a Niffin.

239
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,565
I thought she was dead
for months.

240
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,892
Wait a second.

241
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,944
You thought that Carol
had this Lamprey in her,

242
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,067
and you left me alone with her?

243
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,319
I told you to get away from her.

244
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,574
Okay, you are the most selfish
daughter on the planet.

245
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,748
Quentin, what's going on
with your neck?

246
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,074
What do you mean?

247
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,244
Honey, I thought
I saw Quentin's neck move.

248
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,125
- What?
- Wait.

249
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,672
Where did Quentin get to?

250
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,006
Shit.

251
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,220
We are very,
very lucky Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

252
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,172
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

253
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,179
They can be
most quarrelsome creatures.

254
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,761
I smell like a horse
fucked a bird.

255
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,221
Actually, it was
the other way around.

256
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,776
I'm going to go sun myself up here
while you chat with your pirates.

257
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,397
But don't worry.

258
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,104
I got my eye on you.

259
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,783
Who are you lot supposed to be?

260
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,288
I'm High Queen Margo the
Destroyer, and the entourage.

261
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,282
You brought a fairy with you.

262
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,958
You can see her?

263
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,754
Yes, well, most pirates have made a
fairy deal at one time or another.

264
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,877
My name is Hoop, Ms. Destroyer.

265
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,211
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

266
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,015
My Queen, a word before you go?

267
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,344
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

268
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,100
around the court as pickpockets?

269
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,646
I've heard. What's your point?

270
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,022
Only that my skills in this
field could be useful to you.

271
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,145
I'll keep an eye on my jewels.
Are we done here?

272
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,322
Are you suggesting
that you could...

273
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,907
Although Her Majesty
lacks depth perception,

274
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,836
she does not lack in depth
or perception.

275
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,085
You keep an eye on the pirates.

276
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,384
If anything turns up missing,
we'll know they're the culprits.

277
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,593
I shall catch up with you
below decks, ma'am.

278
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,520
What on Earth are you doing?

279
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,814
I can't afford
even the tiniest crack.

280
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,562
When the Lamprey
is outside the host,

281
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,313
it can enter through
almost any opening.

282
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,520
Why do you assume
the Lamprey's even here?

283
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,606
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

284
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,066
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

285
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,197
You really saw his neck move?

286
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,869
You know, without
your optical spells,

287
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,197
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

288
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,907
I mean, it looked weird.

289
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,958
We can't risk it.
If the Lamprey is in the house,

290
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,913
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

291
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,373
What if Quentin tries
to get back in here himself?

292
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,878
We could call the police.

293
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,301
They could come and
get him out of the house.

294
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,754
Problem solved.

295
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,555
That's a bad idea. If it's inside Quentin,
who knows what he'll do?

296
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,258
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

297
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,060
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

298
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,560
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the Lamprey.

299
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,484
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

300
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,403
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

301
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,697
I'm gonna need more wine.

302
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,901
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

303
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,906
No, a gun won't protect us
against a Lamprey.

304
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,909
That is the only weapon that we have,
except the battery's dead.

305
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,206
We need a new one.

306
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,533
There's a car in the garage.

307
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,744
Don't those use
some kind of battery?

308
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,666
Okay, now what are you doing?

309
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,252
The Lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

310
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,054
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

311
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,303
and I'm not taking any chances.

312
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,683
Thank you.

313
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,773
Yeah.

314
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,150
You're missing the signs, Julia.

315
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,402
What?

316
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,605
I thought you'd be
further along.

317
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,112
We're going to have to push you.

318
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,076
What are you talking about?

319
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,029
I said thank you.

320
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,456
Oh. Sorry.

321
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,582
Alice.

322
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,842
Hey!

323
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,406
Don't come any closer
or I'll smash your head in!

324
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,887
Alice, come on!

325
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,589
Ah! I'm not the Lamprey, Alice!

326
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,174
How do I know
you're not the Lamprey!

327
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,662
I don't know how to prove it.
I'm just, I'm not...

328
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,518
It's... It's gone! It left!

329
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,562
What?

330
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,020
Why did it leave you?

331
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,351
I don't know.

332
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,275
I was awake the whole time.

333
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,870
I could feel it controlling me
and searching my memory.

334
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,370
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

335
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,291
It's angry at you, Alice.

336
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,370
What did you do to it?

337
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,546
I... I don't remember.

338
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,964
It's weird.

339
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,710
I could've snapped your neck
over there so easy.

340
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,387
And the Lamprey didn't want to
for some reason.

341
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,557
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

342
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,761
I am taking our daughter
seriously.

343
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,392
Help me finish taping up the windows,
won't you?

344
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,723
Fine.

345
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,309
But wouldn't it be nice
if just once,

346
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,397
Alice would come without bringing
all of her drama with her?

347
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,824
What's with the candy?

348
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,253
You gonna summon some kind of
chocolate-loving demon to save my ass?

349
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,083
The scent of chocolate makes
them less likely to eat us.

350
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,344
I hope.

351
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,762
The only nice thing
about losing magic...

352
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,686
The radio signals in my head
went out too.

353
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,809
All's quiet
on the psychic front?

354
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,523
Yeah.

355
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,476
Could get used to that.

356
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,940
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

357
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,611
Damn.

358
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,241
You sure you wanna do this?

359
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,324
There's a lot of magic in that.

360
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,409
You sure you wanna
waste it on me?

361
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,834
I stole it.

362
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,294
It's my call.

363
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,631
You don't owe me anything, Kady.

364
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,504
Of course you'd say that.

365
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,755
You got poisoned
trying to help me.

366
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,839
If I didn't try
to help you, I...

367
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,141
I couldn't live with myself.

368
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,848
Guess I should say thanks.

369
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,846
Yeah, you should.

370
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,654
Julia will be back soon.

371
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,367
I will try not to die.

372
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,584
I appreciate that.

373
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,480
Good job, Tick.

374
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,526
Your praise is everything,
but I would also like a country estate.

375
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,228
Don't get greedy.

376
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,702
Queen Margo the Destroyer,
my king.

377
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,201
You're the pirate king?

378
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,330
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

379
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,877
That's fine by me.

380
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:18,333
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

381
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,010
Maybe you and I could, um,

382
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:26,056
take a private cabin and parlay
a thing or two on our own.

383
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,633
Yeah, I'm hot.

384
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,014
You're extremely hot yourself.

385
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,518
But you just took over
my goddamn boat,

386
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,647
which tells me you're not one to
pay attention to a safe word.

387
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,444
What's a safe word?

388
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,066
Exactly.

389
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,366
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

390
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:52,329
But... You give me what I want,
I won't take anything off the table.

391
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,413
Hmm.

392
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,543
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

393
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,216
Well, we've all got a thing.

394
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,301
I need to see High King Eliot.

395
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,052
Now.

396
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,145
Mmm-hmm.

397
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,573
My Queen!

398
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,072
It is I, your High King Eliot...

399
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,870
In the flesh.

400
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,505
So, you think it left the house?

401
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,675
Yes, and we need to find out what it
really wanted before it comes back.

402
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,003
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

403
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,510
but I was thinking we might be better
off avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

404
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,136
I was thinking Asian myself.

405
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,264
Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

406
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,061
But you said it left the house.

407
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,935
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

408
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,141
- Mom.
- Darling...

409
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,476
I have to go to the bathroom.

410
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,901
There's one right out there.

411
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,730
Don't you think we would've heard
it if it had come back inside?

412
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,658
Mom, the Lamprey is tiny,
but it is a powerful magical creature.

413
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,109
Don't underestimate it.

414
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:13,163
First you said it was inside of Carol,
so you electrocuted her.

415
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,742
Then you said it was inside of Quentin,
only now he's back,

416
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,169
and the creature's gone
for some reason.

417
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,838
Am I the only one
that this sounds crazy to?

418
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,085
Stephanie, sweetheart...

419
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,087
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

420
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,215
We've both been in this room
for God knows how long,

421
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,841
and I have to pee.

422
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,015
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

423
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,637
Just go in the corner, Mom.

424
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,287
I am not peeing
in front of your father.

425
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,851
If I had wanted that in my marriage,
I would've stayed with Jean Claude.

426
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,557
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

427
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,314
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

428
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,528
And I am not gonna risk it
just because you think

429
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,107
that you stepped on
some creature's magical toes.

430
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,452
I didn't step on its toes.

431
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,203
I murdered its entire family.

432
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,704
I did experiments on them to figure
out what kind of magic they had.

433
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,876
That's what I did as a Niffin.

434
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,794
Jesus, Alice.

435
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,215
Well, you know,
we've all dealt with our share of monsters.

436
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,542
You don't get it.

437
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,673
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

438
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,801
The Lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

439
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,724
It's just the one
who got my number.

440
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,430
So, I wanna be absolutely clear
on who the real monster is here.

441
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,650
Excuse me.

442
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,236
- That didn't really help.
- I know.

443
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,699
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

444
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,160
Okay, I'll go after her.

445
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,870
Just you and your dad
keep researching.

446
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,672
My Asian languages
are for shit, anyway.

447
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,592
You better tape up.

448
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,759
Yeah.

449
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,587
- Just to be safe.
- Yeah.

450
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,263
So, brass tacks.

451
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,934
You want 3,000 Fillorian Gold
Crescents?

452
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,886
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

453
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,937
I'm crying from
my one eye for you.

454
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,687
There is one more matter.

455
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,691
Our ship, the <i>Sika,</i> is a
Deer Class vessel like yours.

456
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,114
So?

457
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,111
So, it's been a dry voyage.

458
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,444
It's no coincidence
we met like this.

459
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,951
The <i>Sika</i> sought out the
<i>Muntjac</i> after he scented her.

460
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,873
And now he needs her to submit.

461
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,248
What?

462
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,251
Our boat
wants to fuck your boat.

463
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,458
And we can't leave
until he does.

464
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,005
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

465
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,639
and as such, they have the same
sort of biological urges we do.

466
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,095
Although, our ship
is subject to royal command.

467
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,728
Which I couldn't give,
but you can.

468
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,818
So, what?

469
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,145
I just tell our boat to spread it
for their boat and we're done?

470
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,564
What are you not telling me?

471
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:56,242
Well, the boat can be upset
by the experience.

472
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,240
They're not the same after.

473
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,656
Not the same?

474
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,157
Like, how?

475
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,914
They become distracted,
irritable.

476
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,586
Sometimes,
they can't sail right.

477
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,586
Some ships have to be put into
dry dock, never to sail again.

478
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,214
That sounds like PTSD.

479
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,967
So, these pirates are asking
us to let our boat get raped?

480
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,976
My Queen's words, as always,
are coarse, but truthful.

481
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,556
I love this old boat,

482
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,735
but if they don't get what they want,
the pirates will kill the crew.

483
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,876
Ah!

484
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,091
That's a new look for you.

485
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,173
Would you come back with me?
It's not safe in here.

486
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,179
Oh, you heard Alice.

487
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,726
She's the monster.

488
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,647
Come on, she's not a monster,
she's just... Conflicted.

489
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,065
What's it matter?

490
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,727
It's not safe anywhere.

491
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,031
Did you know we got
a tax bill for the house?

492
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,699
Apparently, we haven't paid
in 30 years.

493
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:23,406
Enchantment failed,
so now we're losing our home.

494
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,163
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

495
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,582
I mean, get fucking jobs?

496
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,085
I don't even know
how to do anything.

497
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,007
And Daniel.

498
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,128
There's no place for us
in this world.

499
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:43,475
Sometimes I think Charlie
was the one who got off easy.

500
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,352
Oh, shit.

501
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,723
I am Asteroth.

502
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:40,274
Astaroth, Demon of the Seventh Circle,
Great Duke of The Inferno.

503
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,199
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

504
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,074
Astaroth with an A is my cousin.

505
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,575
You can totally stand.

506
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,954
The whole kneeling thing's
weird.

507
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,306
It's pretty advanced,
and it'll be tough to extract.

508
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,934
Though, those are the tastiest.

509
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,440
Can you do anything?

510
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,435
Surgery.

511
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,858
But it will hurt.

512
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,212
Just, save it, okay?

513
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,210
You'd astrally project, too.

514
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,507
No shame, bro.

515
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,556
Oh, my head is swimming.

516
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,013
I can't read Chinese right now.

517
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,222
How do you read so fast?

518
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,852
This isn't fast.

519
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,962
When I was a Niffin, I didn't
have to rely on my eyes.

520
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,943
This is like running
through water.

521
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,441
It's so slow.

522
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,237
What you said to your mother,
is that true?

523
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,740
What you did
to that Lamprey's family?

524
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
When I was a Niffin,

525
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,491
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

526
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,129
Wait, hold on.

527
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,462
What is it?

528
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,543
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

529
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,883
It's a parasite
similar to the Lamprey.

530
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,555
I think I know what it's doing.

531
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,766
So, um, <i>Muntjac?</i>

532
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,190
I'm High Queen Margo of Fillory.

533
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,484
Your Liege.

534
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,562
I have a kind of problem.

535
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,321
See,

536
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,320
a bunch of pirates boarded you

537
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,902
and are threatening
to kill the crew

538
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,239
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

539
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,540
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

540
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,542
in a Johnny Depp sort of way,
but the fact is,

541
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,546
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

542
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,969
In a Johnny Depp sort of way.

543
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,053
Look...

544
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,767
I could just order you to do it,

545
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,688
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

546
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,981
You have thoughts and
feelings...

547
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,025
I think.

548
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,107
So, I guess I'm asking...

549
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,115
What do you wanna do?

550
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,705
Maybe I'm an idiot
for even asking.

551
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,596
There, there.

552
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,891
Gonna be okay.

553
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,269
I mean, look at me.

554
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,308
I'm a mess.

555
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,644
I have to clean myself up.

556
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,696
I do, I have to clean myself...

557
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,029
What are you... No, no, no, no.

558
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:15,915
What the hell?

559
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,116
No, she was,

560
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,203
kissing me, and I'm just...
Stop, I'm trying to...

561
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,882
Oh, please, we're both adults.

562
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,208
You don't get to judge.

563
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,383
Step away from him, Mom.

564
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,304
Stephanie, do you honestly have
to make this about you too?

565
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,382
Don't psychoanalyze me, Daniel.

566
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,841
Back away, Mom.

567
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,717
- Don't raise your voice to me.
- Oh, God.

568
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,394
Her neck... She's the Lamprey.

569
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,642
What? Oh, don't be ridiculous.

570
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,394
I saw it. Her neck moved.

571
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,726
I told you to back
the fuck away from him!

572
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,698
What?

573
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,110
The Lamprey should
leave her body.

574
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,074
Any moment now.

575
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,072
I swear to God, she kissed me.

576
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,407
Shut up, Quentin.

577
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,581
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

578
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,253
Anything's possible.

579
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,650
The Lamprey
already took you over.

580
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:09,418
It doesn't wanna kill us because it...
Wants to lay eggs inside of us.

581
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,761
And then what?

582
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,467
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

583
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,553
until you die,
and then feeds on the carcass.

584
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,888
I don't understand.

585
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,848
The Lamprey
should've left her by now.

586
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,943
Unless it hasn't left Quentin.

587
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,611
Oh, God. No.

588
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,907
He was trying to kiss her so that the
Lamprey would jump into her body.

589
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:33,993
No.

590
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,655
Stay away from me!

591
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,037
Quentin...

592
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,364
I am not the Lamprey.

593
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,121
This isn't really
a great way to prove that.

594
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,327
If you're not the Lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

595
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,483
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

596
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,999
that I'm not the Lamprey,
and when I do it...

597
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,752
You'll know what to do.

598
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,651
Oh, bravo.

599
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,404
Nicely done.

600
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,243
You got me.

601
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,863
I'm gonna give you
one chance to leave my dad.

602
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,037
Or what?

603
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,116
You'll kill me?

604
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,376
You killed my family.

605
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,463
That wasn't me.

606
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,163
I don't remember
what I did as a Niffin.

607
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,373
Alice, I know you're lying.

608
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,049
Your father could always tell.

609
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,922
That little twitch you get.

610
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,256
You murdered every one of my children
because you were seeking knowledge.

611
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,512
So, what did you learn

612
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,060
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

613
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,016
I wanna know.

614
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,942
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

615
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:55,107
When they died,
they made pretty little lights.

616
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,781
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

617
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,374
It's funny the things
you can sense from the inside.

618
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,247
That one still loves you.

619
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,836
And your father
has a weak heart.

620
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,384
He'll die
if you try to shock me.

621
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,586
You don't know that.

622
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,216
You really wanna risk it?

623
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,095
And I'm sorry I wasn't able
to lay my eggs into her.

624
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:29,483
Since I know how much you hate her,
it's crueler to leave her alive.

625
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:34,487
Well, thank you
for finally being honest.

626
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,573
I'll let myself out.

627
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,601
Thank God.

628
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,974
Kill it, Alice.

629
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,768
Congratulations.

630
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,942
Jesus Christ.

631
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,273
What did you do?

632
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:02,735
I was moved by your speech to the <i>Muntjac,</i>
coming to her defense.

633
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,949
So, I decided to intervene.

634
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,787
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

635
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,254
What?

636
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,046
You stood up to them.

637
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,998
You were a queen.

638
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,216
That's who I need you to be.

639
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,513
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

640
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,465
remember this room.

641
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,011
Now...

642
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,434
There's the matter
of your lying to me.

643
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,898
Did you think I wouldn't be
a queen with you?

644
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,362
Time to give it back.

645
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,574
It's my eye.

646
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,581
It was, but you made a deal.

647
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,627
Tick, Gillen, come here.

648
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,884
Someone has stolen
something from me.

649
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,712
Which one of you was it?

650
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,342
They didn't do this.

651
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,342
I did.

652
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,599
Fine, we do it your way.

653
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,233
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

654
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,281
catch a human by the... Tongue.

655
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,627
You may go.

656
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,632
What did you do?

657
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,385
There is a song
he does not like,

658
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,639
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

659
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:56,644
He will slowly go mad,
then he will not be of much use to you.

660
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,724
My eye.

661
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,945
The eye can never be fixed.

662
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,497
But you can't spy on me anymore.

663
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,122
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

664
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:21,627
You have a week's sail back to Whitespire
to think about what you've done.

665
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,929
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

666
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,473
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

667
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,108
What the hell
did you put in that?

668
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,815
It should kill any of the
eggs left inside of you.

669
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,116
Did you drink it all?

670
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,943
Mmm...

671
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:58,542
When you left Brakebills,
you said that you couldn't forgive me.

672
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,371
Was that real?

673
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,374
Didn't it feel real?

674
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,085
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

675
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,297
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

676
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,847
From the Lamprey, or...

677
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,803
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

678
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,810
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

679
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,314
sort of sleeping together,
or whenever...

680
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,441
There were two of us
doing that, Alice.

681
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,523
- It wasn't just me.
- Yeah, I know.

682
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,073
I...

683
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,572
I know that, and it felt good,

684
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:36,451
I'm not saying that it didn't,
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

685
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,625
I'm just...
I'm not that girl anymore.

686
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,830
And I can't ever be her again.
I don't know how.

687
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:49,385
I know that I have said this before and
that it probably sounds ridiculous.

688
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,961
I just wanna help.

689
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,224
I really mean it.

690
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,050
Yeah, I know. I know you do.

691
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,602
I just...

692
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,939
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I don't know what I want.

693
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,027
That's okay.

694
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,854
It's confusing.

695
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,950
I lived this whole other life,

696
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,535
and a part of that is still who I am,
whether I like it or not.

697
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,246
But when you look at me,

698
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,419
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

699
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,877
The old Alice, like...
Like that's who you want me to be.

700
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,552
She's gone.

701
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,096
It's just...
It makes it too hard, Quentin.

702
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,807
Alice!

703
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,143
Daniel!

704
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,725
Alice!

705
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,360
Daniel!

706
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,812
Oh, my God.

707
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,990
I think I've got it.

708
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,068
Oh, it's juicy.

709
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,161
I'll save it for later.

710
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,210
I'll close the wound.

711
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,294
It may take him
some time to heal.

712
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,087
Thank you.

713
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,771
Penny?

714
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,597
Penny.

715
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,603
Penny?

716
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
Penny.

717
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,401
No.

718
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,230
Penny, come on.

719
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,152
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,152
You called me too late.

721
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,445
No, no, no, he can't.

722
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,700
No, come on, Penny.

723
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,281
Don't... Don't, come on.

724
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,124
Oh, no.

725
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,080
No.

726
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,548
Shit.
