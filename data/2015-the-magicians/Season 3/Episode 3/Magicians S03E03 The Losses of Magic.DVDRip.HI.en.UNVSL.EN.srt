00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,312
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

181
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,785
It's not me. It's
the fucking fairies.

182
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,549
This is more of their bullshit.

183
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:46,115
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,
and now mushroom fields.

184
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,128
I just need it done. Okay?

185
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,994
The Queen will not be pleased.

186
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,900
Are the fairies here right now?

187
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,028
They were.

188
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,606
Now they've gone
to tell the Queen

189
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,800
that we screwed the
pooch right in the pooper.

190
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,969
That sounds painful. It is.

191
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,672
Your Highness!

192
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,044
We just received a
report from the seagulls

193
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,344
that the <i>Muntjac</i> has
been captured by pirates.

194
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,045
Two days' sail
from After Island.

195

Son of a twat.

196
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,051
Tick, what is the
fastest boat in our Navy?

197
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,425
The <i>Morgan Downs,</i> ma'am,
could reach the <i>Muntjac</i> in a week.

198
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,226
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

199
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,463
No, it is not the
best we can muster.

200
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,596
Follow me, dickholes.

201
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,001
Did she call us "dickholes"?

202
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,083
Queen Margo.

203
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,752
Perhaps you can tell
me what's taking so long

204
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,089
to plant the mushroom fields.

(SIGHS)

206
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,861
Mushroom screw-ups
are on these chuckleheads.

207
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,500
Meanwhile, I have
a real problem.

208
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,799
The High King was hijacked
by pirates and I can't help him.

209
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,202
But you can.

210
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,070
I don't see why
that's my problem.

211
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,406
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

212
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,776
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

213
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,610
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

214
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,617
'cause we can't even
defend our high king?

215
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,119
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

216
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,620
see what happens then.

217
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,987
Interesting argument.

218
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,249
I'll tell you what.

219
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,161
I can bring you
there via <i>Pegasus,</i>

220
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,267
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

221
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,598
When do we leave?

229
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,021
What are you doing?

230
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,559
Mom, I don't expect you to understand,
but Carol has a Lamprey inside of her

231
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,403
and if I don't get it
out, it'll kill all of us.

232
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,123
An old Sumerian
text suggested that

233
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,360
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

234
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,866
Oh, God.

Damn it, it's dead.

239
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,639
Quentin, tell her to put that
thing down right this instant.

240
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,714
What are you doing here?

241
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,360
Your cat exploded. What
did you expect me to do?

242
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,751
Not, like, follow
me home. Jesus.

243
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,513
Hold on, your cat exploded?

244
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,853

All of you, stay away from me!

247
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,063
Oh, great.

248
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,194
Now Carol won't come
over here anymore.

249
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,901
Honey, I know this
really isn't the time,

250
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,873
but shouldn't the Lamprey have come
out of Carol after you shocked her?

251
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,717
But the kitten freaked
out when it looked at Carol.

252
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,540
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

253
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,341
Maybe the Lamprey isn't here.

254
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,541
Yeah, well, maybe the
Lamprey doesn't exist.

255
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:59,052
The Lamprey exists, Mother,
and it can track long distances,

256
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,211
and it's coming for me.

257
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,789
Why, what did you do to it?

258
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,221
You wouldn't understand.

259
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,088
Why don't you just try me?

260
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,094
Whatever she did, she did
it because she was a Niffin.

261
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,630
Oh, God, Daniel, I
know she was a Niffin.

262
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,565
I thought she was
dead for months.

263
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,897
Wait a second.

264
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,939
You thought that Carol
had this Lamprey in her,

265
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,064
and you left me alone with her?

266
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,336
I told you to get away from her.

267
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,574
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

268
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,742
Quentin, what's going
on with your neck?

269
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,080
What do you mean?

270
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,252
Honey, I thought I saw
Quentin's neck move.

271
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,119
What? STEPHANIE: Wait.

272
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,657
Where did Quentin get to?

273
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,984
Shit.

274
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,227
PICKWICK: We are very, very
lucky Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

275
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,199
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

276
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,202
They can be most
quarrelsome creatures.

277
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,761
I smell like a
horse fucked a bird.

278
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,239
Actually, it was the
other way around.

279
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:58,768
I'm going to go sun myself up
here while you chat with your pirates.

280
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,404
But don't worry.

281
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,108
I got my eye on you.

282
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,777
Who are you lot supposed to be?

283
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm High Queen Margo the
Destroyer, and the entourage.

284
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,288
You brought a fairy with you.

285
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,952
You can see her?

286
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,760
Yes, well, most pirates have made
a fairy deal at one time or another.

287
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,857
My name is Hoop, Ms. Destroyer.

288
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,234
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

289
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,008
PICKWICK: My Queen,
a word before you go?

290
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,341
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

291
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,108
around the court as pickpockets?

292
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,649
I've heard. What's your point?

293
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,016
Only that my skills in this
field could be useful to you.

294
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,145
I'll keep an eye on my
jewels. Are we done here?

295
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,330
Are you suggesting
that you could...

296
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,901
Although Her Majesty
lacks depth perception,

297
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,836
she does not lack in
depth or perception.

298
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:02,069
You keep an eye on the pirates.

299
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,373
If anything turns up missing,
we'll know they're the culprits.

300
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,607
I shall catch up with
you below decks, ma'am.

301
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,514
STEPHANIE: What
on Earth are you doing?

302
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,818
ALICE: I can't afford
even the tiniest crack.

303
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,553
When the Lamprey
is outside the host,

304
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,322
it can enter through
almost any opening.

305
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,523
Why do you assume
the Lamprey's even here?

306
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,622
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

307
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,066
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

308
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,194
You really saw his neck move?

309
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,863
You know, without
your optical spells,

310
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,204
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

311
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,902
I mean, it looked weird.

312
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,944
We can't risk it. If the
Lamprey is in the house,

313
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,913
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

314
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,381
What if Quentin tries to
get back in here himself?

315
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,884
We could call the police.

316
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,285
They could come and
get him out of the house.

317
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,754
Problem solved.

318
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,553
That's a bad idea. If it's inside
Quentin, who knows what he'll do?

319
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,251
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

320
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,057
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

321
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,566
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the Lamprey.

322
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,500
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

323
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,403
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

324
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,702
I'm gonna need more wine.

325
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,904
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

326
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,913
No, a gun won't protect
us against a Lamprey.

327
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,916
That is the only weapon that we
have, except the battery's dead.

328
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,212
We need a new one.

329
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,547
There's a car in the garage.

330
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,747
Don't those use
some kind of battery?

331
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,719
STEPHANIE: Okay,
now what are you doing?

332
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,252
The Lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

333
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,060
even skin, so I'm
going to get that battery

334
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,294
and I'm not taking any chances.

335
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,698
Thank you.

336
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,773
Yeah.

337
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,143
You're missing the signs, Julia.

338
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,408
What?

339
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,608
I thought you'd
be further along.

340
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,116
We're going to have to push you.

341
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,088
What are you talking about?

342
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,015
I said thank you.

343
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,456
Oh. Sorry.

Hey!

349

Don't come any closer
or I'll smash your head in!

Alice, come on! (SCREAMS)

351
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,575
Ah! I'm not the Lamprey, Alice!

00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,174
How do I know you're
not the Lamprey!

353
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,662
I don't know how to
prove it. I'm just, I'm not...

354
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,518
It's... It's gone! It left!

00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,867
I could feel it controlling me
and searching my memory.

362
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,374
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

363
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,274
It's angry at you, Alice.

364
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,370
What did you do to it?

365
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,540
I... I don't remember.

366
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,981
It's weird.

367
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,710
I could've snapped your
neck over there so easy.

368
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,380
And the Lamprey didn't
want to for some reason.

369
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,551
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,302
But wouldn't it be
nice if just once,

374
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,397
Alice would come without
bringing all of her drama with her?

take a private cabin and

over my goddamn boat,

really wanted before it comes back.

volumes that might be useful,

better off avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

need to stay put here.

heard it if it had come back inside?

Mom, the Lamprey is tiny, but
it is a powerful magical creature.

447
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,126
Don't underestimate it.

448
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:13,155
First you said it was inside of
Carol, so you electrocuted her.

449
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,760
Then you said it was inside
of Quentin, only now he's back,

450
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,169
and the creature's
gone for some reason.

this sounds crazy to?

We've both been in this
room for God knows how long,

455
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,839
and I have to pee.

00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,009
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

457
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,643
Just go in the corner, Mom.

458
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,279
I am not peeing in
front of your father.

00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,849
If I had wanted that in my marriage,
I would've stayed with Jean Claude.

Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

461
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,322
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

462
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,522
And I am not gonna risk
it just because you think

463
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,090
that you stepped on some
creature's magical toes.

464
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,463
I didn't step on its toes.

465
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,197
I murdered its entire family.

466
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,710
I did experiments on them to figure
out what kind of magic they had.

467
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,870
That's what I did as a Niffin.

00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,215
Well, you know, we've all
dealt with our share of monsters.

00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,547
You don't get it.

471
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,679
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

472
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,816
The Lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

473
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,724
It's just the one
who got my number.

474
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:19,424
So, I wanna be absolutely clear
on who the real monster is here.

00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,667
Excuse me.

476
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,242
That didn't really help. I know.

477
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,708
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

478
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,152
Okay, I'll go after her.

479
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,882

480
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,687

are for shit, anyway.

we met like this.

And we can't
leave until he does.

499

Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

500

and as such, they have the
same sort of biological urges we do.

501
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,112
Although, our ship is
subject to royal command.

00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,743
Which I couldn't
give, but you can.

503
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,818
So, what?

504
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,151
I just tell our boat to spread it
for their boat and we're done?

505
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,581
What are you not telling me?

506
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:56,220
Well, the boat can be
upset by the experience.

507
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,229
They're not the same after.

508
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,656

Sometimes, they
can't sail right.

512
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,575
Some ships have to be put
into dry dock, never to sail again.

513
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,202
That sounds like PTSD.

514
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,979

00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,882
Someone has stolen
something from me.

703
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,718
Which one of you was it?

704
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,348
They didn't do this.

705
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,359
I did.

706
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,588
Fine, (SIGHS) we do it your way.

707
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,231
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

708
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,270
catch a human by the... Tongue.

709
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,950
(WHISPERING INAUDIBLY)

710
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,621
You may go.

711
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,630
What did you do?

712
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,393
There is a song
he does not like,

713
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,630
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

714
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:56,640
He will slowly go mad, then he
will not be of much use to you.

715
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,741
My eye.

716
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,953
The eye can never be fixed.

717
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,491
But you can't spy on me anymore.

718
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,119
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

719
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,632
You have a week's sail back to
Whitespire to think about what you've done.

720
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,833
(PANTS)

721
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,935
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

722
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,476
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

723
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,575
(QUENTIN VOMITING)

724
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,849
(COUGHS)

725
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,123
What the hell did
you put in that?

726
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,819
It should kill any of the
eggs left inside of you.

727
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,121
Did you drink it all?

728
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,958
Mmm... (VOMITS)

729
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,534
When you left Brakebills, you
said that you couldn't forgive me.

730
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,365
Was that real?

731
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,371
Didn't it feel real?

732
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,071
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

733
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,308
where you push me
away in order to protect me.

734
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,853
From the Lamprey, or...

735
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,821
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

736
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,825
just going on the
way they were, it's just,

737
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:24,329
sort of sleeping
together, or whenever...

738
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,455
There were two of
us doing that, Alice.

739
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,523
It wasn't just me. Yeah, I know.

740
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,569
I know that, and it felt good,

741
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,471
I'm not saying that it didn't,
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

742
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,640
I'm just... I'm not
that girl anymore.

743
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,841
And I can't ever be her
again. I don't know how.

744
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:49,377
I know that I have said this before
and that it probably sounds ridiculous.

745
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,955
I just wanna help.

746
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,224
I really mean it.

747
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,056
Yeah, I know. I know you do.

748
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,590
I just...

749
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,927
I guess what I'm trying to
say is, I don't know what I want.

750
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,038
That's okay.

751
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,871
It's confusing.

752
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,941
I lived this whole other life,

753
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,543
and a part of that is still who
I am, whether I like it or not.

754
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,246
But when you look at me,

755
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,423
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

756
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,891
The old Alice, like... Like
that's who you want me to be.

757
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,555
She's gone.

758
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,455
(CHUCKLES)

759
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,093
It's just... It makes
it too hard, Quentin.

760
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,801
STEPHANIE: Alice!

761
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,131
Daniel!

762
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,738
Alice!

763
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,345
Daniel!

764
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,812
Oh, my God.

765
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:02,023
(INAUDIBLE)

766
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,984
I think I've got it.

767
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,091
Oh, it's juicy.

768
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,161
I'll save it for later.

769
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,196
I'll close the wound.

770
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,305
It may take him
some time to heal.

771
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,104
JULIA: Thank you.

772
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,807
(SIGHS)

773
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:04,788
KADY: Penny?

774
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,583
Penny.

775
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,586
Penny?

776
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
Penny.

777
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,389
No. (GASPS)

778
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,226
Penny, come on.

779
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,164
I'm sorry.

780
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,163
You called me too late.

781
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,431
No, no, no, he can't.

782
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,700
No, come on, Penny.

783
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,275
Don't... Don't, come on.

784
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,138
Oh, no.

785
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,077
No.

786
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,273
(KADY WHIMPERS)

787
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,548
Shit.
