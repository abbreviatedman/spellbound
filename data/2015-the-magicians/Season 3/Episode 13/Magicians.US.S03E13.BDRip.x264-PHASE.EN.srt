The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:06,345
I'll send you
on an epic quest.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,817
Q, I think this is it.

DIONYSUS: Okay, if fixing magic
is, like, so important to you,

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,620
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,125
that I met back in Athens
one time.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,559
You mean Prometheus?
He's dead.

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,890
Damn it!

10
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,124
He told me
this crazy story one time

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,963
about how there was, like,
a secret back door

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,161
to magic.

I have to be able
to do something with it.

16
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,502

for you to grow.

Okay, tick-tuck.

Does it say
where the castle is?

37
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,524
Shh! Bambi.

39
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,600
Okay, so she faces the
door of the castle.

40
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,202
<i>In the door,
there were seven keyholes.</i>

41

the keys whole</i>

43
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,443

"I'm here to save you.“</i>

48
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,290
I thought the weird door
swallowed the keys.

49
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,585
Yeah, no, it did,
but then...

50
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,127

she has them again?

51

I'm not that drunk.

52
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,291
This is sloppy plotting.

53
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,627
JOSH: Or it's a paradox.

54
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,133
That's a clue.

59
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,400

to charge it,

60
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,674

They'll think of something.

63

All we gotta do
is beat them to it.

their window of time

is super short, right?

00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,282
So do we book tickets?

179
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,549
No, it's not a real place.

180
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,954
Hold on, okay, so...

181
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,582
Ogai, ogaiga,

182
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,127
or however you say it,
is a island

183
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,419
in the fictional tale of
"The Odyssey."

184
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,756
It's a clothing label,

185
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,062
a Eurovision band,

186
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,069
a tech company.
They make games.

187
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,399
Oh, my God.

188
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,640
I know them.
I worship them.

189
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,834
They're the Candy Collider
people.

190
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,737
I nearly spent $600
on level 593.

191
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,144
It took me
12 straight days.

192
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,078
There are prisons,
and there are prisons.

193
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,309
JOSH: Right?

194
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,483
We're all just 24/7,
"Like my post."

195
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,245
Beep-boop. Selfie!

196
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,584
(CHUCKLES) Right?

197
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,682
No one's... No one...

198
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,815
Okay, so the CEO

199
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,862
is a woman named Callie.

200
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,828
<i>Great. Vamonos.</i>

201
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,103
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

202
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,265
because I promised
Prometheus I would,

203
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,434
and I would never
break my word to him,

204
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,975
but for the record,
I'm not a fan.

205
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,111
Of you, this big magic quest,
the whole fucking thing.

206
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,014
It's the reason
Prometheus is dead.

207
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,018
So as far as I'm concerned,

208
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,111
you're a big part
of why he's dead.

209
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,785
No, I... We don't...

210
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,291
Yeah, of course you don't

211
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,789
You're humans.

212
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,722
Little human Magicians.

213
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,520
He loved you so.

214
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,290
All right, here it is.

215
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,636
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

216
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,732
To design a prison that secure

217
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,004
<i>for clients o! that caliber...</i>

218
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,248
<i>When I explained that I would
need the most steadfast jailors,</i>

219
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,989
<i>Prometheus offered
in help find them,</i>

220
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,320
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

221
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,988
<i>Always was good a! quests.</i>

222
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,563
So you trapped
some poor girl

223
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,692
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

224
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,498
She's there of her own will,

225
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,099
as was her father,

226
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,403
who offered himself as,
well, bail, really.

227
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,438
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

228
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,214
I gave them each
an opportunity

229
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,217
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

230
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,011
I assure you,

231
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,349
she can leave if she wishes.

232
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,047
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

233
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,049
Surely the quest
has taught you,

234
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,185
sacrifice is part
of everything.

235
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,358
So when Prometheus

236
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,900
was looking to hide
his back door...

237
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,368
I had already designed
the perfect place.

238
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,630
A place full of monsters

239
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,968
where no one wants to look.

240
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,242
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

241
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,909
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

242
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,279
who couldn't ensure
it remained secure.

243
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,878
<i>He channeled
every atom of power</i>

244
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,251
<i>into me keys.</i>

245
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,157
<i>MARGO: So he, like,
Horcruxed himself?</i>

246
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,381
JOSH: Jesus.

247
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,054
<i>Someone got bit hard
by the martyr bug.</i>

248
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,291
<i>CALYPSO: All I can say
is he believed in you,</i>

249
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,391
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

250
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,401
<i>when you would save us</i>

251
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,731
<i>I! you had magic;.</i>

252
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,100
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

253
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,503
QUENTIN: <i>What</i> does that <i>mean?</i>

254
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,905
Guess we'll find out,

255
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,443
if you get to the end.

256
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,270
He gave everything
for you,

257
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,806
and then his enemies came,

258
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,111
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

259
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,976
<i>With his power gone,</i>

260
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,115
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

261
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,781
<i>and they were strong.</i>

262
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,872
(SIGHS)

263
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,303
Sorry, uh...

264
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,872
It was a long time ago.

265
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,313
So you don't suppose

266
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,184
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

267
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,157
and/or how to get in?
(CHUCKLES)

268
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,123
I've been waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

269
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,994
QUENTIN: Wait,
this looks like...

270
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,970
ls that Fillory?

271
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,301
MARGO: It's upside-down.

272
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,172
CALYPSO: Looked like that before
Ember and Umber got there

273
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,734
when it was just a distant,
wild little world.

274
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,176
Oh, my God.

275
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,377
There's a...

276
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,215
A theory about Castle Whitespire,
that the dwarves based it on

277
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,515
the most perfect design
that they'd ever seen,

278
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,147
a castle called...

279
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,158
Blackspire, but Ember
destroyed it.

280
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,023
More like flipped
the whole thing over

281
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,891
and started over
on the other side.

282
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,487
So my castle is based
on your prison?

283
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,691
What can I say?

284
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,031
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

285
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,002
So Blackspire's still there,

286
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,835
it's just underneath.

287
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,235
Yes.

288
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,608
Good luck with your quest.

289
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, lady, come on.

290
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,239
How do we get in?
The key paradox.

291
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,110
Let me get
one thing clear:

292
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,517
Everything I put
the girl through,

293
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,109
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

294
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,353
You'll find your way in,

295
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,219
and you'll find a way
to do it safely and securely,

296
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,852
but whatever you do,
there's one simple thing

297
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,419
you need to understand
above everything else.

298
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,392
What's locked inside
that castle...

299
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,632
Can never, ever be allowed
to escape.

300
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,733
(EXHALES)

301
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,246
Begging pardon, we need
your official permission.

302
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,952
As acting High King.

303
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,916
Oh.

304
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,923
You have my permission
to implement the new schedule.

305
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,290
Excellent,
Your acting Majesty.

306
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,623
FEN: And if it's no trouble,

307
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,425
bring the tax collector's
latest expense reports.

308
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,233
L would like to
double-check them.

309
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,126
Sorry.

310
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,065
Of course.
Right away.

311
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,478
FAIRY QUEEN:
You need to stop apologizing.

312
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,943
You'd do well to remember, that
power comes from High King Margo,

313
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,147
but it flows through you.

314
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,945
Is there something you need?

315
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,013
Yes.

316
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,117
Six fairies have disappeared
in two days.

317
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,121
And how are you certain
this is...

318
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,528
I found this.

319
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,624
I believe it's a part of
a magical device

320
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,331
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

321
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,440
There is no magic.

322
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,768
Someone's hunting my people.

323
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,387
What is this?

324
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,722
<i>My Mm,</i>

325
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,157
where I come to think,
answer texts, create worlds.

326
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,464
Wait, do I get to
create worlds?

327
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,298
I mean, we'll start with one.

328
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,994
You'll split your time
between the lab

329
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,165
and answering the prayers
of your choice.

330
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,333
But I'll be blunt.

331
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,310
The work we do here is much
more vital to the big picture,

332
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,506
but we find that
morale stays higher

333
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,640
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

334
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,085
One more thing.

335
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,015
My friends...

336
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,186
How come I can still
feel them?

337
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,360
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

338
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,690
Q is stressing, and Fen...

339
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,234
I know that she wants to help
save these fairies' lives but...

340
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,166
This is the discipline.

341
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,171
You need to keep
from being seduced.

342
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,072
You're wasted if you expend
too much energy

343
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,268
trying to look after
every last fairy

344
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,175
when you could be building
and shaping worlds

345
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,181
where no fairy
ever comes to harm.

346
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,944
Why don't I show you?

347
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,184
MARGO: So do we think
the knight chick

348
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,556
is somehow still in there?

349
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,759
It's god magic,
so anything's possible.

350
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,200
We really don't know
what could be in there.

351
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,291
I'll travel in.

352
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,267
Excuse us for caring, but, no.

353
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,129
We don't know
what you'd be blipping into,

354
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,071
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

355
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,302
from the last Penny.

356
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,134
PENNY 23: Okay.

357
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,877
Say we do find some window.

358
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,747
We know this knight
is gonna help us?

359
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,793
Hi. You're asleep.
(GASPS)

360
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,562
I'm in your head, not his.

361
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,270
It's a dream.

362
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,178
ORA: You have magic.

363
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,741
Had.

364
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,512
It's sort of a one-off.

365
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,812
Listen...
Ora.

366
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,622
I'm Quentin.

367
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,587
I need your help.

368
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,683
You're here
about the fountain?

369
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,921
The back door to magic?

370
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,491
Yeah.
I can't help.

371
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,624
Because you're guarding
all the...

372
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,100
No. They're all gone.

373
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,769
He's the only one left.

374
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,329
Did they all die, or?

375
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,774
He killed them all.

376
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,271
You can't imagine
what he's capable of.

377
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,813
That's why I can't do
anything for you.

378
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,372
I cannot risk
the security of my charge.

379
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,779
I get that

380
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,517
I have something
to offer you too.

381
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,050
Julia gave you a hit of
magic, and you did what?

382
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,888
Incepted the knight
in the castle.

383
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,656
MARGO: That magic was
for killing a monster.

384
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,629
Why waste it on chatting
with the help?

385
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,667
When Calypso told us that Ora
was there on her own accord,

386
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,465
I figured she must know
more than one way

387
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,164
in and out of the castle,
and she does,

388
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,672
and she's going to
open it for us.

389
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,710
In exchange for...
All you have to do is get in,

390
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,074
tum the key,
and get out fast.

391
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,679
Um, what about the monster?

392
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,080
Ora will take care of
the monster.

393
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,650
What about you?

394
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,982
I stay in the castle.

395
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,413
It's a fair deal.

396
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,754
She's been there for
centuries, and she's tired,

397
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,022
and I'm...
I'm strong enough,

398
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,528
thanks to the quest,
so I'm the new jailor.

399
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,228
This isn't the solution.
I second that.

400
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,031
Alice, who's the one
that died for us?

401
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,205
You were willing to stay in Fillory
for forever. How is this different?

402
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,175
Someone has to step up.

403
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,406
MARGO:
Quick alternative pitch:

404
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,038
Take the gun with
the god-killing bullet

405
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,242
and shoot the fucking monster
in the face.

406
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,511
Second second that, yes.

407
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,575
No.

408
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,949
I promised, no clever stuff.

409
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,721
It's more bloody
and straightforward.

410
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,448
Look, this monster,

411
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,787
it's not a joke.

412
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,727
We cannot let it escape,

413
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,230
and the only way to make sure
that it doesn't

414
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,765
is to do this
the hard way.

415
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,630
The quest taught us that
it's like that sometimes.

416
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,209
I don't like this.

417
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,644
Me neither,
but I'm going to do it.

418
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,823
Hello, love.

419
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,121
(LAUGHS)

420
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,985
Oh, shit.

421
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,128
It's a human.
(SIGHS)

422
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,563
It's also the current ruler
of Fillory.

423
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,757
Hello.

424
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,498
We've met, so we can
get right to the part

425
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,166
where I tell you to stop
stealing fairies to chop up.

426
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,265
They are full citizens
of Fillory.

427
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,606
You will cease at once.

428
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,305
Full citizens. Well, la di da.
(LAUGHS)

429
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,014
Escort them to the.“

430
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,315
Uh-uh' uh.
Know what a Traveler is?

431
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,686
We can blip on out of here
and go about our beeswax

432
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,917
anytime we please.

433
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,456
I have something
you very much need

434
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,126
in the castle.

435
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,464
They won't be but a moment.

436
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,872
And may I say' sir,

437
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,808
how much I admire your suit.

438
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,608
I've been passing bunnies
with Margo.

439
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,047
They are very close
to turning magic back on.

440
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,617
Hooray for them.

441
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,152
And you must know

442
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,777
the reason Irene
is poaching fairies

443
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,515
is she needs
a huge amount of energy

444
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,717
to power a thing
that must be placed

445
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,987
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

446
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,529
Let me save your breath.

447
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,120
I don't care.

448
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,893
You should.

449
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,661
If we keep her long enough,

450
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,669
we can stop her
from derailing magic

451
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,706
and taking it for herself
and for the Library.

452
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,240
This is the future
we're talking about.

453
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,637
Not our future.

454
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,878
I cannot risk another soul.

455
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,072
I know exactly
how to deal with this.

456
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,511
IRENE; <i>So, what are you
offering, exactly?</i>

457
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,344
FAIRY QUEEN:
I broke a deal.

458
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,820
It's my fault
we're vulnerable.

459
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,884
I offer you the magic
of 50 fairies

460
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,862
with a single body.

461
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,600
You know the power
of royal marrow.

462
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,498
You're volunteering
to die?

463
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,040
In exchange for
a new agreement.

464
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,767
Wait.
No fairy will be hunted

465
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,039
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

466
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,712
and this deal
cannot be broken,

467
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,548
for any reason,
by any being, ever.

468
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,882
Swear to that,
and you have me.

469
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,084
Time is of the essence.

470
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,396
My offer expires
in one minute.

471
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,430
IRENE: <i>I'm gonna need</i> a <i>table</i>

472
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,730
with restraints,
a bone saw,

473
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,931
knives, and a grinder.

474
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,768
(CONTINUES SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY)

475
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,075
There must be another way.

476
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,870
The deal I struck
with Irene

477
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,646
will finally make it possible

478
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,309
for my people
to be safe and free.

479
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,419
Tears for your enemy?

480
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,008
DEAN: Any day now.

481
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,510
My God.

482
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,103
Where did it turn out
to be, Alice?

483
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,116
This Castle
at the End of the World?

484
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,611
Fillory. Underneath.

485
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,078
Castle Blackspire.

486
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,422
How did you...
l was a fan, too, once.

487
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,818
(CHUCKLES)

488
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,653
I need a favour.

489
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,521
I have this,

490
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,765
and I know it's wrong,
and I'll never use it again,

491
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,995
but I need it.

492
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,030
To?

493
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,100
I hear you have
an experimental potion

494
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,971
that not only wipes
your memory,

495
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,942
but creates
a whole new persona.

496
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,309
I do, but what?

497
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,046
I'll always be tempted.

498
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,642
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

499
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,715
Unless I have no memory.

500
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,716
Alice,

501
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,187
you are...

502
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,486
You are one of the most
brilliant Magicians

503
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,825
I've ever seen.

504
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,663
I didn't choose to be!

505
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,632
L want to live my life,

506
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,671
not how my parents
raised me to think,

507
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,004
or what you taught me,

508
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,476
or what the Library
wants me to do.

509
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,139
I'm not sure if that's
the best path to happiness.

510
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,206
What if there is
no best path, huh?

511
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,677
I don't know.

512
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,718
All I know is the one I'm on
is a bad one...

513
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,081
And I'm stepping off.

514
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,878
Once you've... (SNIFFS)

515
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,076
Yes?

516
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,549
Drink this.

517
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,518
Give it about a full day

518
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,847
for everything
to get rebooted.

519
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,790
After that,

520
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,291
you are on your own.

521
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,527
Thank you.

522
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,805
So?

523
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,311
We need to talk

524
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,250
about our arrangement

525
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,002
You tell anyone else?

526
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,806
Please don't

527
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,608
Of course not.

528
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,254
You're the only one
that I...

529
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,813
Wanted...
Had to tell.

530
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,688
Look, I know that I don't show
it or act like it all the time,

531
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,264
but you're...

the way we have.

They're barely using
213 of their allotment,

714
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,897
and they've offered it
to us.

715
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,763
Both you and they need to
bring a written request to...

716
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:22,803
In triplicate.

717
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,107
You'll have a decision
by the 31st.

718
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,277
Excellent

719
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,813
There's just
one more request.

720
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,989
My answer hasn't changed.

721
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,156
She made a deal with us,
then broke it.

722
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,622
Unlike the others,

723
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,684
she belongs to the Library.

724
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,463
I just would like to see her.

725
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,365
Please.

Where are they?

728
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,338
Per the deal,
as struck with The Order,

729
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,840
safe.

730
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,308
No, no, no, no, no,
they're not.

731
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,147
Alice, the McAllistairs
can't find them,

732
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,181
and if they try,

733
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,020
the Library's retribution
will be swift.

734
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,856
Not the McAllistairs!
That thing!

735
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,692
It can jump bodies,
I told you.

736
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,856
You should know,

737
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,828
that alone is a very
dangerous ability.

738
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,558
If they don't know
who they are,

739
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,660

they can't protect themselves.

this thing gets loose.

It's seen them.

746
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,051
It knows magic is back.

747
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,881
It knows they're Magicians,
