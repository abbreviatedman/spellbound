1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,541
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:06,338
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,789
Q, I think this is it.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,419
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,752
Okay, if fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,586
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,091
that I met back in Athens
one time.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,548
You mean Prometheus? He's dead.

9
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,883
Damn it!

10
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,093
He told me
this crazy story one time

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,930
about how there was, like,
a secret back door

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,139
to magic.

13
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,233
<i>I have...</i>

14
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,524
<i>Magic.</i>

15
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,727
I have to be able
to do something with it.

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,482
I planted a seed
for you to grow.

17
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,780
<i>It doesn't matter
where it comes from.</i>

18
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,524
<i>It matters what you do with it.</i>

19
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,876
<i>"The Tale of the Seven Keys,"</i>

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,337
<i>chapter eight.</i>

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,045
<i>The knight remained imprisoned</i>

22
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,051
<i>at the Castle
at the End of the World.</i>

23
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,258
<i>Not even a warrior
as great as he</i>

24
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,704
<i>could break the bonds
placed on him</i>

25
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,139
<i>by the witch.</i>

26
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,096
<i>He could not escape.</i>

27
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,398
<i>But his daughter, now every bit</i>

28
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,691
<i>the knight her father was,</i>

29
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,643
<i>and more so, never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,196
<i>She fought monsters,
real and imagined,</i>

31
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,525
<i>without as well as within.</i>

32
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,655
<i>She had won all seven keys,</i>

33
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,361
<i>and now she set sail</i>

34
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,037
<i>for the Castle at the End
of the World.</i>

35
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,331
Okay, tick-tock.

36
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,749
Does it say where the castle is?

37
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,497
Shh! Bambi. Let him read.

38
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,169
Just saying, <i>Ã¡ndale.</i>

39
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,589
Okay, so she faces
the door of the castle.

40
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,169
<i>In the door,
there were seven keyholes.</i>

41
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,629
<i>The door swallowed
the keys whole</i>

42
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,555
<i>and slowly opened.</i>

43
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,429
<i>Up ahead, she saw her father,
bound by seven chains.</i>

44
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,727
<i>"Father," she cried,
"I'm here to save you."</i>

45
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,180
<i>She placed the keys
into the locks,</i>

46
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,418
<i>and when she turned
the seventh...</i>

47
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,603
<i>Sorry, time out.</i>

48
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,276
I thought the weird door
swallowed the keys.

49
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,569
Yeah, no, it did, but then...

50
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,113
But then she has them again?

51
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,531
I'm not that drunk.

52
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,280
This is sloppy plotting.

53
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,611
Or it's a paradox.

54
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,116
That's a clue.

55
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,789
Oh, we're fucked.

56
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,867
The fucking Library
is ready to swoop in

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,168
with a... What's it called?

58
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,792
Siphon,
and it's not that simple.

59
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,373
Takes a lot of power
to charge it,

60
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,737
and they don't have those
kind of reserves just lying around,

61
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,753
thanks to Julia
freeing those fairies.

62
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,634
Yeah, well, it's the Library.
They'll think of something.

63
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,431
All we gotta do
is beat them to it.

64
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,758
I mean, their window of time

65
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,596
to even use the whatchamacallit
is super short, right?

66
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,851
Less than a minute,
once we turn the key.

67
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,898
There you go.
Get all this done before...

68
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,692
<i>Our Lady of the Tree, help us.</i>

69
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,940
<i>Please, help me!</i>

70
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,033
Hi, Julia.

71
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,449
Pleasure to finally meet you.

72
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,903
I'm Iris, messenger goddess,

73
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,079
bon vivant, rainbow aficionado.

74
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,201
Let's chat.

75
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,533
Who's...

76
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,368
Our Lady of the Tree?

77
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,462
You are.

78
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,127
I presume they mean the trees
you brought back in Fillory.

79
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,800
Lovely act of penance.
Good moniker for you.

80
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,594
Just what are you saying?

81
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,174
You fulfilled the task
Our Lady Underground gave you...

82
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,849
To grow the spark...

83
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,598
And now you are the flame.

84
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,355
So I'm...

85
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,647
A full-on goddess, correct.

86
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,604
Holy shit.

87
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,277
Shall we go?
We have a lot of work

88
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,070
to do, love, all very exciting.

89
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,314
I'm sort of in the middle
of this quest.

90
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,492
Oh, that.
They can take it from here.

91
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,028
Your concerns are greater now.

92
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,239
Your duty to them is over.

93
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,913
And by the way,
so is all that pain.

94
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,753
You can put it down.

95
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,465
Okay.

96
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,836
I mean, should I, like, bow?

97
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,043
No. I mean, I'm still me.

98
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,298
Well, you're clearly not.

99
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,631
I mean, it's been kind of hard to ignore
the nuclear power plant

100
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,341
radiating off you
the last couple weeks.

101
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,386
I don't know, just...

102
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,887
Wanted us to finish
this together, you know?

103
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,141
Mmm. Me too, but...

104
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,267
I mean, let's be honest, like,

105
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,568
you deserve this.

106
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,024
Why me?

107
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,822
Life is unfair,

108
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,900
but I'm good with it
occasionally working out

109
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,281
for people that I actually love.

110
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,246
Our Lady of the Tree.

111
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,120
No, it's good.

112
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,624
Yeah, it's good.

113
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,796
It's formal.

114
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,124
Very formal.

115
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,337
I'm gonna miss you too.

116
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,065
What was that?

117
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,022
It's enough juice
for a one-off spell.

118
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,573
You know, just in case, like,

119
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,027
a giant <i>Indiana Jones</i> boulder
comes hurtling at you.

120
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,657
You can fight it off.

121
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,417
I love you, Jules.

122
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,795
I love you too.

123
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,592
Goodbye, Quentin.

124
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,579
Any headway?

125
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,080
Well, wasted a few hours

126
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,377
looking at castles, but...

127
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,546
Think I'm onto something,

128
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,758
or someone, who could help us.

129
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,678
I've been tripping on this,
hard.

130
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,847
It's the witch, in the castle,
sitting at a table,

131
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,555
on which another,
smaller, castle...

132
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,637
- Yeah?
- Well, either this is some.

133
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,347
M.C. Escher,
"the castle goes on forever" shit,

134
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,808
or that picture means something.

135
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,643
Do you see these?

136
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,194
These are drafting tools

137
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,988
for architects.

138
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,658
Right, she's
the architect that...

139
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,951
That Reynard talked about,

140
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,528
that she's... Oh, my God,

141
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,488
she's the one that,
she made the prison

142
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,915
for the mistakes of the gods,

143
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,204
and she hid it.

144
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,041
She knows where it is.

145
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,498
We need to find her, Q.

146
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,881
There are, like, 50 minor gods
of architecture and the arts.

147
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,178
Well, come at me.

148
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,384
Let's get 'em all down here.

149
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,886
I mean, full-on goddess, huh?

150
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,136
Look, I mean, I get that Julia
has been through some shit,

151
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,393
but seriously,
it just seems random.

152
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,565
So it's like life, then?

153
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,608
I don't know. I'm happy for her.

154
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,561
Me too. Might as well be.

155
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,819
Well, I'd be happier if she stayed,
so she could help us.

156
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,400
Look, she seemed pretty positive

157
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,053
that we could do this
without her, so...

158
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,486
You forgot Calypso.

159
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,946
Like the musical style?

160
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,248
The witch
that imprisoned Odysseus.

161
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,745
And I love you, El,

162
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,667
but how the hell
did you pass AP Lit

163
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,837
- without ever reading?
- I didn't.

164
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,585
So, according to the story,

165
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,040
she was a nymph, which...

166
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,168
Not a god, but I assume
a pretty powerful creature,

167
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,549
considering she had him
in lockdown

168
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,929
for, like, seven full years
on an island called Ogai...

169
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,179
Ogiji?

170
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,350
Ogijia?

171
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,516
- Ogygia.
- However that's pronounced.

172
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,892
Cool. Great.

173
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,268
So do we book tickets?

174
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,521
No, it's not a real place.

175
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,943
Hold on, okay, so...

176
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,565
Ogai, ogaiga,

177
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,114
or however you say it,
is a island

178
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,400
in the fictional tale of
"The Odyssey."

179
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,739
It's a clothing label,

180
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,037
a Eurovision band,

181
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,035
a tech company. They make games.

182
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,366
Oh, my God.

183
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,626
I know them. I worship them.

184
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,829
They're the Candy Collider
people.

185
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,714
I nearly spent $600
on level 593.

186
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,133
It took me 12 straight days.

187
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,051
There are prisons,
and there are prisons.

188
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,298
Right?

189
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,473
We're all just 24/7,
"Like my post."

190
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,220
Beep-boop. Selfie!

191
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,551
Right?

192
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,682
No one's... No one...

193
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,808
Okay, so the CEO

194
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,857
is a woman named Callie.

195
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,809
Great. <i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

196
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,066
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

197
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,243
because I promised
Prometheus I would,

198
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,412
and I would never
break my word to him,

199
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,952
but for the record,
I'm not a fan.

200
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,078
Of you, this big magic quest,
the whole fucking thing.

201
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,003
It's the reason
Prometheus is dead.

202
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,001
So as far as I'm concerned,

203
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,084
you're a big part
of why he's dead.

204
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,752
No, I... We don't...

205
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,257
Yeah, of course you don't.

206
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,758
You're humans.

207
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,719
Little human Magicians.

208
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,509
He loved you so.

209
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,262
All right, here it is.

210
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,609
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

211
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,733
To design a prison that secure

212
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,985
<i>for clients of that caliber...</i>

213
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,240
<i>When I explained that I would need
the most steadfast jailors,</i>

214
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,956
<i>Prometheus offered
to help find them,</i>

215
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,292
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

216
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,957
<i>Always was good at quests.</i>

217
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,544
So you trapped some poor girl

218
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,675
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

219
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,473
She's there of her own will,

220
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,092
as was her father,

221
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,395
who offered himself as,
well, bait, really.

222
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,436
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

223
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,191
I gave them each an opportunity

224
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,191
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

225
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,988
I assure you,

226
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,316
she can leave if she wishes.

227
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,025
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

228
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,032
Surely the quest has taught you,

229
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,159
sacrifice is part of everything.

230
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,330
So when Prometheus

231
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,878
was looking to hide
his back door...

232
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,331
I had already designed
the perfect place.

233
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,625
A place full of monsters

234
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,965
where no one wants to look.

235
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,215
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

236
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,884
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

237
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,264
who couldn't ensure
it remained secure.

238
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,853
<i>He channeled every atom of power</i>

239
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,229
<i>into the keys.</i>

240
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,152
<i>So he, like, Horcruxed himself?</i>

241
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,364
<i>Jesus.</i>

242
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,031
<i>Someone got bit hard
by the martyr bug.</i>

243
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,280
<i>All I can say
is he believed in you.</i>

244
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,361
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

245
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,367
<i>when you would save us</i>

246
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,698
<i>if you had magic.</i>

247
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,078
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

248
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,500
<i>What does that mean?</i>

249
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,873
Guess we'll find out,

250
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,421
if you get to the end.

251
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,253
He gave everything for you,

252
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,801
<i>and then his enemies came,</i>

253
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,091
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

254
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,967
<i>With his power gone,</i>

255
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,099
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

256
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,767
<i>and they were strong.</i>

257
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,294
Sorry, uh...

258
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,869
It was a long time ago.

259
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,293
So you don't suppose

260
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,170
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

261
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,133
and/or how to get in?

262
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,090
I've been waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

263
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,980
Wait, this looks like...

264
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,936
Is that Fillory?

265
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,268
It's upside-down.

266
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,149
Looked like that
before Ember and Umber got there

267
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,731
when it was just a distant,
wild little world.

268
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,157
Oh, my God.

269
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,363
There's a...

270
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,202
A theory about Castle Whitespire,
that the dwarves based it on

271
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,499
the most perfect design
that they'd ever seen,

272
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,121
a castle called...

273
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,124
Blackspire, but Ember
destroyed it.

274
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,001
More like flipped
the whole thing over

275
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,877
and started over
on the other side.

276
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,459
So my castle
is based on your prison?

277
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,669
What can I say?

278
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,006
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

279
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,965
So Blackspire's still there,

280
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,801
it's just underneath.

281
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,219
Yes.

282
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,597
Good luck with your quest.

283
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,001
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, lady, come on.

284
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,294
How do we get in?
The key paradox.

285
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,105
Let me get one thing clear:

286
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,485
Everything I put
the girl through,

287
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,110
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

288
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,317
You'll find your way in,

289
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,263
and you'll find a way
to do it safely and securely,

290
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,826
but whatever you do,
there's one simple thing

291
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,408
you need to understand
above everything else.

292
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,378
What's locked inside
that castle...

293
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,630
Can never, ever be allowed
to escape.

294
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,223
Begging pardon,
we need your official permission.

295
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,938
As acting High King.

296
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,894
Oh.

297
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,898
You have my permission
to implement the new schedule.

298
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,277
Excellent, Your acting Majesty.

299
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,607
And if it's no trouble,

300
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,409
bring the tax collector's
latest expense reports.

301
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,202
I would like to
double-check them.

302
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,120
Sorry.

303
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,041
Of course. Right away.

304
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,468
You need to stop apologizing.

305
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,927
You'd do well to remember,
that power comes from High King Margo,

306
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,134
but it flows through you.

307
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,997
Is there something you need?

308
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,021
Yes.

309
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,098
Six fairies have disappeared
in two days.

310
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,107
And how are you certain
this is...

311
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,525
I found this.

312
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,604
I believe it's a part of
a magical device

313
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,317
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

314
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,406
There is no magic.

315
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,742
Someone's hunting my people.

316
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,387
What is this?

317
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,715
My lab,

318
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,144
where I come to think,
answer texts, create worlds.

319
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,437
Wait, do I get to create worlds?

320
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,272
I mean, we'll start with one.

321
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,975
You'll split your time
between the lab

322
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,152
and answering the prayers
of your choice.

323
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,318
But I'll be blunt.

324
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,273
The work we do here is
much more vital to the big picture,

325
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,484
but we find that
morale stays higher

326
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,614
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

327
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,076
One more thing.

328
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,000
My friends...

329
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,160
How come I can still feel them?

330
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,336
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

331
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,676
Q is stressing, and Fen...

332
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,220
I know that she wants to help save
these fairies' lives but...

333
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,138
This is the discipline.

334
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,137
You need to keep
from being seduced.

335
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,052
You're wasted if you expend
too much energy

336
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,263
trying to look after
every last fairy

337
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,145
when you could be building
and shaping worlds

338
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,147
where no fairy
ever comes to harm.

339
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,940
Why don't I show you?

340
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,154
So do we think the knight chick

341
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,534
is somehow still in there?

342
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,743
It's god magic,
so anything's possible.

343
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,166
We really don't know
what could be in there.

344
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,292
I'll travel in.

345
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,248
Excuse us for caring, but, no.

346
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,126
We don't know
what you'd be blipping into,

347
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,115
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

348
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,300
from the last Penny.

349
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,131
Okay.

350
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,846
Say we do find some window.

351
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,727
We know this knight
is gonna help us?

352
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,779
Hi. You're asleep.

353
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,535
I'm in your head, not his.

354
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,242
It's a dream.

355
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,167
You have magic.

356
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,715
Had.

357
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,512
It's sort of a one-off.

358
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,799
- Listen...
- Ora.

359
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,597
I'm Quentin.

360
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,562
I need your help.

361
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,750
You're here about the fountain?

362
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,890
The back door to magic?

363
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,480
- Yeah.
- I can't help.

364
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,611
Because you're guarding
all the...

365
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,063
No. They're all gone.

366
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,741
He's the only one left.

367
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,318
Did they all die, or?

368
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,737
He killed them all.

369
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,243
You can't imagine
what he's capable of.

370
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,853
That's why I can't do
anything for you.

371
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,369
I cannot risk
the security of my charge.

372
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,749
I get that.

373
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,506
I have something
to offer you too.

374
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,053
Julia gave you a hit of magic,
and you did what?

375
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,880
Incepted the knight
in the castle.

376
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,636
That magic was
for killing a monster.

377
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,592
Why waste it on chatting
with the help?

378
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,645
When Calypso told us that Ora was
there on her own accord,

379
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,439
I figured she must know
more than one way

380
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,142
in and out of the castle,
and she does,

381
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,647
and she's going to
open it for us.

382
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,696
- In exchange for...
- All you have to do is get in,

383
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,069
turn the key, and get out fast.

384
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,651
Um, what about the monster?

385
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,077
Ora will take care of
the monster.

386
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,616
What about you?

387
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,957
I stay in the castle.

388
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,420
It's a fair deal.

389
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,747
She's been there for centuries,
and she's tired,

390
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,002
and I'm... I'm strong enough,

391
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,506
thanks to the quest,
so I'm the new jailor.

392
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,213
- This isn't the solution.
- I second that.

393
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,014
Alice, who's the one
that died for us?

394
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,183
You were willing to stay in Fillory
for forever. How is this different?

395
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,148
Someone has to step up.

396
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,395
Quick alternative pitch:

397
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,045
Take the gun with
the god-killing bullet

398
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,229
and shoot the fucking monster
in the face.

399
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,483
Second second that, yes.

400
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,574
No.

401
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,944
I promised, no clever stuff.

402
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,693
It's more bloody
and straightforward.

403
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,448
Look, this monster,

404
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,784
it's not a joke.

405
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,699
We cannot let it escape,

406
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,271
and the only way to make sure
that it doesn't

407
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,752
is to do this the hard way.

408
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,627
The quest taught us
that it's like that sometimes.

409
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,175
I don't like this.

410
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,642
Me neither,
but I'm going to do it.

411
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,820
Hello, love.

412
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,982
Oh, shit.

413
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,117
It's a human.

414
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,529
It's also the current ruler
of Fillory.

415
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,748
Hello.

416
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,495
We've met, so we can get
right to the part

417
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,169
where I tell you to stop
stealing fairies to chop up.

418
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,247
They are full citizens
of Fillory.

419
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,582
You will cease at once.

420
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,300
Full citizens. Well, la di da.

421
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,009
Escort them to the...

422
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,307
Uh-uh, uh.
Know what a Traveler is?

423
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,680
We can blip on out of here
and go about our beeswax

424
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,887
anytime we please.

425
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,437
I have something
you very much need

426
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,101
in the castle.

427
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,447
They won't be but a moment.

428
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,869
And may I say, sir,

429
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,789
how much I admire your suit.

430
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,582
I've been passing bunnies
with Margo.

431
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,036
They are very close
to turning magic back on.

432
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,586
Hooray for them.

433
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,130
And you must know

434
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,752
the reason Irene
is poaching fairies

435
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,504
is she needs
a huge amount of energy

436
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,712
to power a thing
that must be placed

437
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,968
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

438
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,515
Let me save your breath.

439
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,092
I don't care.

440
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,886
You should.

441
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,645
If we keep her long enough,

442
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,643
we can stop her
from derailing magic

443
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,692
and taking it for herself
and for the Library.

444
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,297
This is the future
we're talking about.

445
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,607
Not our future.

446
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,863
I cannot risk another soul.

447
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,070
I know exactly
how to deal with this.

448
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,498
<i>So, what are you
offering, exactly?</i>

449
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,325
I broke a deal.

450
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,786
It's my fault we're vulnerable.

451
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,873
I offer you the magic
of 50 fairies

452
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,837
with a single body.

453
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,596
You know the power
of royal marrow.

454
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,470
You're volunteering to die?

455
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,017
In exchange for a new agreement.

456
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,771
- Wait.
- No fairy will be hunted

457
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,021
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

458
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,689
and this deal cannot be broken,

459
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,523
for any reason,
by any being, ever.

460
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,868
Swear to that, and you have me.

461
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,079
Time is of the essence.

462
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,371
My offer expires in one minute.

463
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,416
<i>I'm gonna need a table</i>

464
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,714
with restraints, a bone saw,

465
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,917
knives, and a grinder.

466
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,053
There must be another way.

467
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,842
The deal I struck with Irene

468
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,644
will finally make it possible

469
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,313
for my people
to be safe and free.

470
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,402
Tears for your enemy?

471
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,997
Any day now.

472
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,501
My God.

473
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,084
Where did it turn out
to be, Alice?

474
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,090
This Castle
at the End of the World?

475
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,589
Fillory. Underneath.

476
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,052
Castle Blackspire.

477
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,389
- How did you...
- I was a fan, too, once.

478
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,640
I need a favor.

479
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,524
I have this,

480
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,729
and I know it's wrong,
and I'll never use it again,

481
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,984
but I need it.

482
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,027
To?

483
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,075
I hear you have
an experimental potion

484
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,949
that not only wipes your memory,

485
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,905
but creates a whole new persona.

486
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,290
I do, but what?

487
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,035
I'll always be tempted.

488
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,623
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

489
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,715
Unless I have no memory.

490
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,714
Alice,

491
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,171
you are...

492
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,475
You are one of the most
brilliant Magicians

493
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,806
I've ever seen.

494
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,637
I didn't choose to be!

495
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,604
I want to live my life,

496
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,652
not how my parents
raised me to think,

497
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,979
or what you taught me,

498
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,439
or what the Library
wants me to do.

499
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,116
I'm not sure if that's
the best path to happiness.

500
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,195
What if there is
no best path, huh?

501
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,655
I don't know.

502
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,704
All I know is the one I'm on
is a bad one...

503
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,079
And I'm stepping off.

504
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,856
Once you've...

505
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,062
Yes?

506
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,522
Drink this.

507
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,482
Give it about a full day

508
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,821
for everything to get rebooted.

509
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,781
After that,

510
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,288
you are on your own.

511
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,499
Thank you.

512
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,806
So?

513
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,304
We need to talk

514
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,222
about our arrangement.

515
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,998
You tell anyone else?

516
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,793
Please don't.

517
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,586
Of course not.

518
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,222
You're the only one that I...

519
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,805
Wanted... Had to tell.

520
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,692
Look, I know that I don't show it
or act like it all the time,

521
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,237
but you're...

522
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,906
You're the one that I love, Q.

523
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,443
You're the one.

524
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,706
And the only thing I'm going to regret
is not remembering that.

525
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,455
Well...

526
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,713
Well, I'll remember
for the both of us.

527
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,330
You made a deal you will regret.

528
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,246
You'll never know.

529
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,131
True.

530
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,629
But I'll die a queen,

531
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,804
not some mediocre,
power-hungry girl.

532
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,926
As I said, I'm only alive
because I fulfill its need.

533
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,681
To be entertained.

534
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,512
Served, coddled.

535
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:30,938
Loved.

536
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,020
Loved, like...

537
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,605
A child.

538
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,195
Okay, that's better
than my first thought.

539
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,944
Right now, he thinks
we're playing a game.

540
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,033
Hide and seek.

541
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,096
It's the only way to ensure
he'd stay diverted long enough

542
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,282
to let you in, and right now,
he's getting bored.

543
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,122
What's up?

544
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,959
In case I get held up.

545
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,499
Don't. Hear me?

546
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,301
You got this, okay?

547
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,183
My love?

548
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,391
I found you! I tag you!

549
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,898
Give it a moment.

550
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,985
Does it have a name?

551
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,316
No.

552
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,162
What makes it so dangerous?

553
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,367
The gods created something
that simply wants.

554
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,328
So it has to know one secure place
and constant love.

555
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,960
If not,
if its appetite goes unfed

556
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,541
and it's unleashed,

557
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,127
even the gods can't stop it.

558
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,009
Love?

559
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,226
Come out! Did you fall asleep?

560
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,015
Yeah, but what can it do?

561
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,409
Will you play with me?

562
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,184
Eliot! No!

563
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,948
- Fuck, Eliot...
- How?

564
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,400
God-killing bullet.

565
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,323
This is not what we agreed on.

566
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,405
I didn't actually agree
on anything,

567
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,226
but I did decide that
one of my best friends

568
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,833
wouldn't spend the rest of
his life locked in a prison,

569
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,912
guarding what turns out to be
a really not-so-scary monster.

570
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,923
Wait, where'd she go?

571
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,131
Anyway, it's done.

572
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,054
You spent a little bit
too much time as a king.

573
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,931
Well, that's really not
the issue now, is it?

574
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,033
Could've used some
Goo Gone and a toothbrush,

575
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,585
but I think we're good to go.
All right, let's go.

576
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,941
Let's go. Come on, come on.

577
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,190
All right, bitches,
everyone grab a key.

578
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,402
Alice, what are you doing?

579
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,576
Nothing good.

580
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,071
- No!
- Margo!

581
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,044
She's destroying the keys!

582
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,246
I have to.

583
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,048
You don't get to decide that
the whole universe doesn't have magic.

584
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,500
I'll never remember this.

585
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,846
Alice...

586
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,560
Why?

587
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,896
You...

588
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,732
You talked me out of
working for the Library.

589
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,395
I realize there's no good side.

590
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,652
Magic just makes people
different shades of bad,

591
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,485
selfish and irresponsible.

592
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,161
- We can't handle it!
- You can't handle it.

593
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,909
It's wrong.

594
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,285
We're wrong.

595
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,950
And it stops now!

596
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,056
What are you doing?

597
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,256
I'm gonna cut the bitch,

598
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,012
grab her fairy coke power-up,

599
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,102
and fix this.

600
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,933
<i>So, where shall we start?</i>

601
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,480
Ocean?

602
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,898
Cute little landmass?

603
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,817
Dealer's choice.

604
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,105
I know you can still feel them.

605
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,690
You need to let them go.

606
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,734
I know, but it's bad.

607
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,702
In a blink, it'll be good again,

608
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,205
and in two blinks,
they'll be long gone.

609
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,916
<i>He's on the floor. He's...</i>

610
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,411
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

611
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,246
<i>He'll die, not giving up.</i>

612
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,582
Can't you feel his heart?

613
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,752
<i>No,</i>

614
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,303
<i>'cause I don't do
what you're doing.</i>

615
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,224
You need to let them go.

616
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,353
Remember the future
we're creating.

617
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,526
Will you play with me?

618
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,284
Hey!

619
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,488
You think you can cast
faster than I can stab? Go!

620
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,684
Please, just listen to me.
The knight...

621
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,994
Ah, shut up the fuck up...

622
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,545
- Fix this.
- Now.

623
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,461
There's no point.

624
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,886
The magic's gone. It's done.

625
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,263
He's right.

626
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,021
Jules.

627
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,191
None of your pain
is what we'd call quiet,

628
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,269
especially yours.

629
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,023
I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

630
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,951
You'll see someday,

631
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,615
it wasn't.

632
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:23,700
For now, I need you
to stay out of the way.

633
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,302
I want you to know,
it's your bravery...

634
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,517
Made me see.

635
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,306
See what?

636
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,187
What I need to do.

637
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,444
What are you doing?

638
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,780
What Prometheus did.

639
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,524
Whore-crotching.

640
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,526
- Horcruxing.
- Oh.

641
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,031
Look, Jules, are you sure?

642
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,572
Julia, you could lose
your power.

643
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,588
- Hurry.
- You okay?

644
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,186
Okay, okay.

645
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,604
Hey, I got you. I got you.

646
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,939
Come on.

647
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,731
Are you okay?

648
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,393
It hurt.

649
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,697
And I'm not connected
to anything anymore.

650
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,317
- I got you.
- Are you guys ready?

651
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,152
Match it with the key.

652
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,829
Let's do this.

653
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,286
Dean Fogg?

654
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,547
Travel, Penny, I kill them all.

655
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,297
Irene...

656
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,048
We do have a deal.

657
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,553
Unless you want to have
a problem with the Library.

658
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,661
The very essence is altered

659
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,864
by the slightest deviation
in finger position.

660
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,993
Watch closely.

661
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,921
The difference is in
the position of the right middle finger.

662
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,173
Sorry, looks like we're
having another...

663
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,130
Power issue.

664
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,633
The rations
are wholly inadequate.

665
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,934
I can't even assign homework!

666
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,685
Do the best you can.

667
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,643
I'll attempt to renegotiate
for our supply.

668
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,728
How?

669
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,840
I'm afraid we can't revisit
your supply until next quarter.

670
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,526
I've spoken to the Board.

671
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,860
Which Board?

672
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,136
North American Fourth District.

673
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,651
Calgary enrollment

674
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,702
hasn't bounced back
the way we have.

675
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,621
They're barely using
2/3 of their allotment,

676
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,869
and they've offered it to us.

677
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,743
Both you and they need
to bring a written request to...

678
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,797
In triplicate.

679
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,090
You'll have a decision
by the 31st.

680
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,262
Excellent.

681
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,799
There's just one more request.

682
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,976
My answer hasn't changed.

683
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,141
She made a deal with us,
then broke it.

684
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,600
Unlike the others,

685
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,682
she belongs to the Library.

686
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,435
I just would like to see her.

687
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,357
Please.

688
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,529
Where are they?

689
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,334
Per the deal,
as struck with The Order,

690
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,834
safe.

691
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,292
No, no, no, no, no, they're not.

692
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,125
Alice, the McAllistairs
can't find them,

693
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,176
and if they try,

694
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,004
the Library's retribution
will be swift.

695
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,841
Not the McAllistairs!
That thing!

696
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,675
It can jump bodies, I told you.

697
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,850
You should know,

698
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,812
that alone is a very
dangerous ability.

699
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,626
If they don't know who they are,

700
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,850
if they don't have magic,
they can't protect themselves.

701
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,435
Okay.

702
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,187
Hypothetically,

703
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,364
this thing gets loose.

704
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,029
Why would it go after them?

705
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,154
It's seen them.

706
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,040
It knows magic is back.

707
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,870
It knows they're Magicians,
even if they don't.

708
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,798
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

709
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,305
Sophie, hit pause
on your idiocy for a sec.

710
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,094
Janet?

711
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,050
Hi, I'm Isaac.

712
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,902
You're late. Me, too.

713
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,231
Uh, luckily, I don't recognize
the legality of red lights.

714
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,520
Quentin.

715
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,767
I found you.

716
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,560
Oh, uh...

717
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,979
No, sorry, I'm Brian.

718
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,650
Do a card trick for me, Quentin.

719
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,983
Come on.

720
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,324
Will you play with me?

721
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,247
Uh, I'm sorry,
I think you've got me

722
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,413
mistaken for somebody else,

723
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,745
but I... You know...

724
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,335
<i>I saw it.</i>

725
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,913
<i>I've felt it!</i>

726
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,999
Even the gods are afraid of it.

727
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,089
This is your fault,
just as much as it is mine.

728
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,886
Get me out of here!

729
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,308
Help me stop it.

730
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,743
Don't be scared.

731
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,324
This is great!

732
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,080
There's so much
for us to do together.

733
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,076
I can't wait to get started

734
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,911
on all the people

735
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,122
who really deserve our wrath.

736
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,083
Um, no, look, please, I'm not...

737
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,009
This is gonna be so fun.

738
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,972
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.
