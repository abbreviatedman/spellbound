1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,594
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,367
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,840
Q, I think this is it.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,467
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,855
Okay, if fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,643
then you should just
talk to this crazy guy

7
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,148
that I met back in
Athens one time.

8
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,615
You mean Prometheus? He's dead.

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,946
Damn it!

10
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,146
He told me this
crazy story one time

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,985
about how there was,
like, a secret back door

12
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,183
to magic.

13
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,282
<i>I have...</i>

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,554
<i>Magic.</i>

15
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,789
I have to be able to
do something with it.

16
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,524
I planted a seed
for you to grow.

17
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,793
<i>It doesn't matter
where it comes from.</i>

18
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,561
<i>It matters what you do with it.</i>

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,906
<i>"The Tale of the Seven Keys,"</i>

20
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,381
<i>chapter eight.</i>

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,116
<i>The knight remained imprisoned</i>

22
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,124
<i>at the Castle at the
End of the World.</i>

23
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,319
<i>Not even a warrior
as great as he</i>

24
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,738
<i>could break the
bonds placed on him</i>

25
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,196
<i>by the witch.</i>

26
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,164
<i>He could not escape.</i>

27
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,428
<i>But his daughter, now every bit</i>

28
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,730
<i>the knight her father was,</i>

29
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,703
<i>and more so, never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,230
<i>She fought monsters,
real and imagined,</i>

31
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,573
<i>without as well as within.</i>

32
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,703
<i>She had won all seven keys,</i>

33
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,407
<i>and now she set sail</i>

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,073
<i>for the Castle at
the End of the World.</i>

35
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,378
Okay, tick-tock.

36
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,782
Does it say where the castle is?

37
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,547
Shh! Bambi. Let him read.

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,213
Just saying, <i>Ã¡ndale.</i>

39
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,622
Okay, so she faces
the door of the castle.

40
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,224
<i>In the door, there
were seven keyholes.</i>

41
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,696
<i>The door swallowed
the keys whole</i>

42
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,596
<i>and slowly opened.</i>

43
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,465
<i>Up ahead, she saw her
father, bound by seven chains.</i>

44
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,767
<i>"Father," she cried,
"I'm here to save you."</i>

45
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,239
<i>She placed the
keys into the locks,</i>

46
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,451
<i>and when she
turned the seventh...</i>

47
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,636
<i>Sorry, time out.</i>

48
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,312
I thought the weird
door swallowed the keys.

49
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,608
Yeah, no, it did, but then...

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,172
But then she has them again?

51
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,581
I'm not that drunk.

52
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,313
This is sloppy plotting.

53
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,651
Or it's a paradox.

54
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,156
That's a clue.

55
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,819
Oh, we're fucked.

56
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,917
The fucking Library
is ready to swoop in

57
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,225
with a... What's it called?

58
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,822
Siphon, and it's
not that simple.

59
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,423
Takes a lot of
power to charge it,

60
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,778
and they don't have those kind
of reserves just lying around,

61
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,794
thanks to Julia
freeing those fairies.

62
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,670
Yeah, well, it's the Library.
They'll think of something.

63
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,471
All we gotta do
is beat them to it.

64
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,805
I mean, their window of time

65
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,644
to even use the whatchamacallit
is super short, right?

66
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,910
Less than a minute,
once we turn the key.

67
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,952
There you go. Get
all this done before...

68
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,749
<i>Our Lady of the Tree, help us.</i>

69
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,981
<i>Please, help me!</i>

70
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,082
Hi, Julia.

71
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,491
Pleasure to finally meet you.

72
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,955
I'm Iris, messenger goddess,

73
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,124
bon vivant, rainbow aficionado.

74
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,222
Let's chat.

75
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,597
Who's...

76
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,433
Our Lady of the Tree?

77
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,504
You are.

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,175
I presume they mean the
trees you brought back in Fillory.

79
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,844
Lovely act of penance.
Good moniker for you.

80
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,645
Just what are you saying?

81
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:04,207
You fulfilled the task Our
Lady Underground gave you...

82
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,877
To grow the spark...

83
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,614
And now you are the flame.

84
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,412
So I'm...

85
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,685
A full-on goddess, correct.

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,658
Holy shit.

87
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,321
Shall we go? We
have a lot of work

88
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,092
to do, love, all very exciting.

89
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,364
I'm sort of in the
middle of this quest.

90
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,528
Oh, that. They can
take it from here.

91
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,068
Your concerns are greater now.

92
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,272
Your duty to them is over.

93
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,942
And by the way,
so is all that pain.

94
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,774
You can put it down.

95
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,515
Okay.

96
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,881
I mean, should I, like, bow?

97
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,079
No. I mean, I'm still me.

98
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,348
Well, you're clearly not.

99
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,687
I mean, it's been kind of hard
to ignore the nuclear power plant

100
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,386
radiating off you the
last couple weeks.

101
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,422
I don't know, just...

102
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,929
Wanted us to finish
this together, you know?

103
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,157
Mmm. Me too, but...

104
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,326
I mean, let's be honest, like,

105
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,598
you deserve this.

106
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,065
Why me?

107
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,875
Life is unfair,

108
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,934
but I'm good with it
occasionally working out

109
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,309
for people that I actually love.

110
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,282
Our Lady of the Tree.

111
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,187
No, it's good.

112
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,689
Yeah, it's good.

113
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,850
It's formal.

114
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,153
Very formal.

115
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,362
I'm gonna miss you too.

116
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,113
What was that?

117
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,082
It's enough juice
for a one-off spell.

118
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,618
You know, just in case, like,

119
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,086
a giant <i>Indiana Jones</i>
boulder comes hurtling at you.

120
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,680
You can fight it off.

121
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,462
I love you, Jules.

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,825
I love you too.

123
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,637
Goodbye, Quentin.

124
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,590
Any headway?

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,135
Well, wasted a few hours

126
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,399
looking at castles, but...

127
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,571
Think I'm onto something,

128
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,809
or someone, who could help us.

129
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,708
I've been tripping
on this, hard.

130
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,878
It's the witch, in the
castle, sitting at a table,

131
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,611
on which another,
smaller, castle...

132
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,679
Yeah? Well, either this is some

133
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,384
M.C. Escher, "the castle
goes on forever" shit,

134
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,859
or that picture means something.

135
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,691
Do you see these?

136
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,230
These are drafting tools

137
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,027
for architects.

138
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,703
Right, she's the
architect that...

139
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,998
That Reynard talked about,

140
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,562
that she's... Oh, my God,

141
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,540
she's the one that,
she made the prison

142
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,940
for the mistakes of the gods,

143
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,243
and she hid it.

144
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,071
She knows where it is.

145
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,548
We need to find her, Q.

146
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,920
There are, like, 50 minor gods
of architecture and the arts.

147
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,217
Well, come at me.

148
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,416
Let's get 'em all down here.

149
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,925
I mean, full-on goddess, huh?

150
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,191
Look, I mean, I get that Julia
has been through some shit,

151
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,427
but seriously, it
just seems random.

152
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,593
So it's like life, then?

153
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,660
I don't know. I'm happy for her.

154
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,603
Me too. Might as well be.

155
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,870
Well, I'd be happier if she
stayed, so she could help us.

156
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,486
Look, she seemed pretty positive

157
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,070
that we could do
this without her, so...

158
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,545
You forgot Calypso.

159
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,013
Like the musical style?

160
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,277
The witch that
imprisoned Odysseus.

161
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,818
And I love you, El,

162
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,717
but how the hell
did you pass AP Lit

163
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,881
without ever reading? I didn't.

164
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,618
So, according to the story,

165
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,091
she was a nymph, which...

166
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,219
Not a god, but I assume
a pretty powerful creature,

167
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,595
considering she
had him in lockdown

168
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,965
for, like, seven full years
on an island called Ogai...

169
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,230
Ogiji?

170
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,430
Ogijia?

171
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,564
Ogygia. KADY: However
that's pronounced.

172
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,937
Cool. Great.

173
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,305
So do we book tickets?

174
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,571
No, it's not a real place.

175
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,976
Hold on, okay, so...

176
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,605
Ogai, ogaiga,

177
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,150
or however you
say it, is a island

178
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,442
in the fictional tale
of "The Odyssey."

179
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,779
It's a clothing label,

180
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,085
a Eurovision band,

181
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,092
a tech company. They make games.

182
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,388
Oh, my God.

183
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,663
I know them. I worship them.

184
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,857
They're the Candy
Collider people.

185
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,760
I nearly spent
$600 on level 593.

186
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,166
It took me 12 straight days.

187
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,101
There are prisons,
and there are prisons.

188
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,332
Right?

189
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,506
We're all just 24/7,
"Like my post."

190
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,268
Beep-boop. Selfie!

191
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,607
Right?

192
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,738
No one's... No one...

193
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,838
Okay, so the CEO

194
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,908
is a woman named Callie.

195
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,851
Great. <i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

196
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,126
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

197
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,288
because I promised
Prometheus I would,

198
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,423
and I would never
break my word to him,

199
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,997
but for the record,
I'm not a fan.

200
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,135
Of you, this big magic
quest, the whole fucking thing.

201
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,037
It's the reason
Prometheus is dead.

202
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,075
So as far as I'm concerned,

203
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,134
you're a big part
of why he's dead.

204
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,807
No, I... We don't...

205
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,279
Yeah, of course you don't.

206
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,777
You're humans.

207
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,744
Little human Magicians.

208
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,542
He loved you so.

209
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,279
All right, here it is.

210
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,625
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

211
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,789
To design a prison that secure

212
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,027
<i>for clients of that caliber...</i>

213
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,271
<i>When I explained that I would
need the most steadfast jailors,</i>

214
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,977
<i>Prometheus offered
to help find them,</i>

215
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,308
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

216
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,976
<i>Always was good at quests.</i>

217
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,586
So you trapped some poor girl

218
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,715
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

219
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,487
She's there of her own will,

220
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,156
as was her father,

221
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,425
who offered himself
as, well, bait, really.

222
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,461
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

223
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,237
I gave them each an opportunity

224
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,239
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

225
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,033
I assure you,

226
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,371
she can leave if she wishes.

227
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,071
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

228
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,072
Surely the quest has taught you,

229
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,207
sacrifice is part of everything.

230
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,381
So when Prometheus

231
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,923
was looking to
hide his back door...

232
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,356
I had already designed
the perfect place.

233
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,654
A place full of monsters

234
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,990
where no one wants to look.

235
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,265
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

236
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,932
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

237
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,301
who couldn't ensure
it remained secure.

238
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,900
<i>He channeled every atom of power</i>

239
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,274
<i>into the keys.</i>

240
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,180
<i>So he, like, Horcruxed himself?</i>

241
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,404
<i>Jesus.</i>

242
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,077
<i>Someone got bit
hard by the martyr bug.</i>

243
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,313
<i>All I can say is
he believed in you.</i>

244
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,415
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

245
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,424
<i>when you would save us</i>

246
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,754
<i>if you had magic.</i>

247
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,123
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

248
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,559
<i>What does that mean?</i>

249
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,927
Guess we'll find out,

250
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,465
if you get to the end.

251
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,293
He gave everything for you,

252
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,829
<i>and then his enemies came,</i>

253
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,133
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

254
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,998
<i>With his power gone,</i>

255
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,138
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

256
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,803
<i>and they were strong.</i>

257
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,335
Sorry, uh...

258
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,894
It was a long time ago.

259
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,335
So you don't suppose

260
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,206
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

261
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,181
and/or how to get in?

262
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,112
I've been waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

263
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,016
Wait, this looks like...

264
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,993
Is that Fillory?

265
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,289
It's upside-down.

266
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,194
Looked like that before
Ember and Umber got there

267
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,790
when it was just a
distant, wild little world.

268
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,199
Oh, my God.

269
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,400
There's a...

270
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,238
A theory about Castle Whitespire,
that the dwarves based it on

271
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,539
the most perfect design
that they'd ever seen,

272
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,169
a castle called...

273
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,180
Blackspire, but
Ember destroyed it.

274
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,045
More like flipped
the whole thing over

275
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,913
and started over
on the other side.

276
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,510
So my castle is
based on your prison?

277
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,714
What can I say?

278
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,054
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

279
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,025
So Blackspire's still there,

280
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,823
it's just underneath.

281
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,258
Yes.

282
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,664
Good luck with your quest.

283
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,043
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, lady, come on.

284
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,311
How do we get in?
The key paradox.

285
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,133
Let me get one thing clear:

286
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,539
Everything I put
the girl through,

287
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,132
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

288
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,376
You'll find your way in,

289
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,288
and you'll find a way to
do it safely and securely,

290
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,874
but whatever you do,
there's one simple thing

291
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,441
you need to understand
above everything else.

292
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,414
What's locked
inside that castle...

293
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,655
Can never, ever be
allowed to escape.

294
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:52,269
Begging pardon, we need
your official permission.

295
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,974
As acting High King.

296
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,940
Oh.

297
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,946
You have my permission to
implement the new schedule.

298
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,313
Excellent, Your acting Majesty.

299
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,646
And if it's no trouble,

300
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,448
bring the tax collector's
latest expense reports.

301
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,221
I would like to
double-check them.

302
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,149
Sorry.

303
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,054
Of course. Right away.

304
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,502
You need to stop apologizing.

305
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,966
You'd do well to remember, that
power comes from High King Margo,

306
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,170
but it flows through you.

307
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,022
Is there something you need?

308
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,070
Yes.

309
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,140
Six fairies have
disappeared in two days.

310
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,143
And how are you
certain this is...

311
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,584
I found this.

312
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,646
I believe it's a part
of a magical device

313
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:47,353
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

314
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,428
There is no magic.

315
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,790
Someone's hunting my people.

316
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,444
What is this?

317
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,744
My lab,

318
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:15,180
where I come to think,
answer texts, create worlds.

319
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,453
Wait, do I get to create worlds?

320
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,286
I mean, we'll start with one.

321
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,016
You'll split your
time between the lab

322
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,188
and answering the
prayers of your choice.

323
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,355
But I'll be blunt.

324
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,332
The work we do here is much
more vital to the big picture,

325
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,528
but we find that
morale stays higher

326
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,628
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

327
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,107
One more thing.

328
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,038
My friends...

329
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,208
How come I can still feel them?

330
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,383
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

331
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,713
Q is stressing, and Fen...

332
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,256
I know that she wants to help
save these fairies' lives but...

333
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,189
This is the discipline.

334
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,159
You need to keep
from being seduced.

335
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,094
You're wasted if you
expend too much energy

336
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,325
trying to look after
every last fairy

337
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,198
when you could be
building and shaping worlds

338
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,169
where no fairy
ever comes to harm.

339
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,968
Why don't I show you?

340
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,207
So do we think the knight chick

341
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,579
is somehow still in there?

342
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,783
It's god magic, so
anything's possible.

343
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,222
We really don't know
what could be in there.

344
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,348
I'll travel in.

345
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,290
Excuse us for caring, but, no.

346
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,185
We don't know what
you'd be blipping into,

347
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,140
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

348
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,325
from the last Penny.

349
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,156
Okay.

350
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,899
Say we do find some window.

351
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,769
We know this knight
is gonna help us?

352
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,849
Hi. You're asleep.

353
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,551
I'm in your head, not his.

354
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,294
It's a dream.

355
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,201
You have magic.

356
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,763
Had.

357
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,535
It's sort of a one-off.

358
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,836
Listen... Ora.

359
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,645
I'm Quentin.

360
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,609
I need your help.

361
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,792
You're here about the fountain?

362
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,909
The back door to magic?

363
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,513
Yeah. I can't help.

364
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,647
Because you're
guarding all the...

365
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,088
No. They're all gone.

366
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,792
He's the only one left.

367
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,352
Did they all die, or?

368
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,762
He killed them all.

369
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,293
You can't imagine
what he's capable of.

370
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,878
That's why I can't
do anything for you.

371
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,428
I cannot risk the
security of my charge.

372
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,768
I get that.

373
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,539
I have something
to offer you too.

374
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,106
Julia gave you a hit of
magic, and you did what?

375
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,945
Incepted the
knight in the castle.

376
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,727
That magic was
for killing a monster.

377
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,652
Why waste it on
chatting with the help?

378
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,690
When Calypso told us that Ora
was there on her own accord,

379
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,487
I figured she must
know more than one way

380
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,187
in and out of the
castle, and she does,

381
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,695
and she's going
to open it for us.

382
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,732
In exchange for... All
you have to do is get in,

383
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,097
turn the key, and get out fast.

384
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,702
Um, what about the monster?

385
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,102
Ora will take care
of the monster.

386
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,638
What about you?

387
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,970
I stay in the castle.

388
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,469
It's a fair deal.

389
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,812
She's been there for
centuries, and she's tired,

390
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,044
and I'm... I'm strong enough,

391
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,551
thanks to the quest,
so I'm the new jailor.

392
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,250
This isn't the
solution. I second that.

393
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,054
Alice, who's the
one that died for us?

394
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,228
You were willing to stay in Fillory
for forever. How is this different?

395
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,198
Someone has to step up.

396
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,478
Quick alternative pitch:

397
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,062
Take the gun with
the god-killing bullet

398
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,265
and shoot the fucking
monster in the face.

399
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,534
Second second that, yes.

400
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,607
No.

401
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,973
I promised, no clever stuff.

402
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,744
It's more bloody
and straightforward.

403
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,471
Look, this monster,

404
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,809
it's not a joke.

405
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,750
We cannot let it escape,

406
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,296
and the only way to
make sure that it doesn't

407
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,788
is to do this the hard way.

408
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,652
The quest taught us that
it's like that sometimes.

409
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,232
I don't like this.

410
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,667
Me neither, but
I'm going to do it.

411
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,879
Hello, love.

412
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,007
Oh, shit.

413
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,150
It's a human.

414
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,551
It's also the current
ruler of Fillory.

415
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,789
Hello.

416
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,554
We've met, so we
can get right to the part

417
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,223
where I tell you to stop
stealing fairies to chop up.

418
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,289
They are full
citizens of Fillory.

419
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,629
You will cease at once.

420
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,329
Full citizens. Well, la di da.

421
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,072
Escort them to the...

422
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,337
Uh-uh, uh. Know
what a Traveler is?

423
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,743
We can blip on out of here
and go about our beeswax

424
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,905
anytime we please.

425
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,478
I have something
you very much need

426
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,148
in the castle.

427
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,486
They won't be but a moment.

428
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,928
And may I say, sir,

429
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,831
how much I admire your suit.

430
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,630
I've been passing
bunnies with Margo.

431
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,103
They are very close to
turning magic back on.

432
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,639
Hooray for them.

433
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,174
And you must know

434
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,800
the reason Irene
is poaching fairies

435
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,538
is she needs a huge
amount of energy

436
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,775
to power a thing
that must be placed

437
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,009
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

438
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,551
Let me save your breath.

439
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,109
I don't care.

440
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,916
You should.

441
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,683
If we keep her long enough,

442
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,691
we can stop her
from derailing magic

443
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,728
and taking it for herself
and for the Library.

444
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,315
This is the future
we're talking about.

445
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,626
Not our future.

446
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,900
I cannot risk another soul.

447
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,095
I know exactly how
to deal with this.

448
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,534
<i>So, what are you
offering, exactly?</i>

449
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,366
I broke a deal.

450
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,808
It's my fault we're vulnerable.

451
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,906
I offer you the
magic of 50 fairies

452
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,885
with a single body.

453
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,623
You know the power
of royal marrow.

454
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,521
You're volunteering to die?

455
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,063
In exchange for a new agreement.

456
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,824
Wait. No fairy will be hunted

457
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,062
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

458
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,734
and this deal cannot be broken,

459
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,571
for any reason,
by any being, ever.

460
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,904
Swear to that, and you have me.

461
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,106
Time is of the essence.

462
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,418
My offer expires in one minute.

463
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,487
<i>I'm gonna need a table</i>

464
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,752
with restraints, a bone saw,

465
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,953
knives, and a grinder.

466
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,097
There must be another way.

467
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,859
The deal I struck with Irene

468
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,703
will finally make it possible

469
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,332
for my people to
be safe and free.

470
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,442
Tears for your enemy?

471
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,064
Any day now.

472
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,566
My God.

473
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,126
Where did it turn
out to be, Alice?

474
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,138
This Castle at the
End of the World?

475
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,633
Fillory. Underneath.

476
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,065
Castle Blackspire.

477
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,411
How did you... I
was a fan, too, once.

478
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,676
I need a favor.

479
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,544
I have this,

480
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,788
and I know it's wrong,
and I'll never use it again,

481
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,017
but I need it.

482
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,052
To?

483
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,123
I hear you have an
experimental potion

484
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,994
that not only wipes your memory,

485
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,930
but creates a whole new persona.

486
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,332
I do, but what?

487
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,069
I'll always be tempted.

488
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,665
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

489
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,738
Unless I have no memory.

490
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:26,739
Alice,

491
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,210
you are...

492
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,509
You are one of the
most brilliant Magicians

493
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,848
I've ever seen.

494
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,685
I didn't choose to be!

495
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,621
I want to live my life,

496
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,694
not how my parents
raised me to think,

497
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,026
or what you taught me,

498
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,498
or what the Library
wants me to do.

499
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,161
I'm not sure if that's the
best path to happiness.

500
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,229
What if there is
no best path, huh?

501
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,699
I don't know.

502
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,741
All I know is the one
I'm on is a bad one...

503
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,104
And I'm stepping off.

504
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,901
Once you've...

505
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,098
Yes?

506
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,572
Drink this.

507
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,507
Give it about a full day

508
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,869
for everything to get rebooted.

509
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,812
After that,

510
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,313
you are on your own.

511
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,516
Thank you.

512
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:58,827
So?

513
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,333
We need to talk

514
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,272
about our arrangement.

515
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,026
You tell anyone else?

516
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,829
Please don't.

517
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,630
Of course not.

518
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,242
You're the only one that I...

519
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,836
Wanted... Had to tell.

520
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,711
Look, I know that I don't
show it or act like it all the time,

521
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,253
but you're...

522
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,923
You're the one that I love, Q.

523
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,488
You're the one.

524
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,725
And the only thing I'm going to
regret is not remembering that.

525
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,497
Well...

526
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,738
Well, I'll remember
for the both of us.

527
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,369
You made a deal you will regret.

528
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,279
You'll never know.

529
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,178
True.

530
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,677
But I'll die a queen,

531
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,814
not some mediocre,
power-hungry girl.

532
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,977
As I said, I'm only alive
because I fulfill its need.

533
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,740
To be entertained.

534
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,543
Served, coddled.

535
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,975
Loved.

536
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,045
Loved, like...

537
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,645
A child.

538
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,252
Okay, that's better
than my first thought.

539
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,985
Right now, he thinks
we're playing a game.

540
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,082
Hide and seek.

541
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,138
It's the only way to ensure
he'd stay diverted long enough

542
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,324
to let you in, and right
now, he's getting bored.

543
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,164
What's up?

544
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,998
In case I get held up.

545
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,541
Don't. Hear me?

546
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,349
You got this, okay?

547
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,214
My love?

548
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,416
I found you! I tag you!

549
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,929
Give it a moment.

550
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,024
Does it have a name?

551
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,363
No.

552
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,198
What makes it so dangerous?

553
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,400
The gods created
something that simply wants.

554
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,370
So it has to know one secure
place and constant love.

555
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,007
If not, if its
appetite goes unfed

556
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,574
and it's unleashed,

557
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,143
even the gods can't stop it.

558
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,051
Love?

559
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,262
Come out! Did you fall asleep?

560
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,054
Yeah, but what can it do?

561
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,445
Will you play with me?

562
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,204
Eliot! No!

563
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,981
Fuck, Eliot... How?

564
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,451
God-killing bullet.

565
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,382
This is not what we agreed on.

566
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,446
I didn't actually
agree on anything,

567
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,268
but I did decide that
one of my best friends

568
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,887
wouldn't spend the rest of
his life locked in a prison,

569
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,954
guarding what turns out to be
a really not-so-scary monster.

570
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,965
Wait, where'd she go?

571
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,164
Anyway, it's done.

572
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:12,110
You spent a little bit
too much time as a king.

573
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,975
Well, that's really not
the issue now, is it?

574
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,126
Could've used some Goo
Gone and a toothbrush,

575
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,627
but I think we're good
to go. All right, let's go.

576
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,983
Let's go. Come on, come on.

577
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,215
All right, bitches,
everyone grab a key.

578
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,461
Alice, what are you doing?

579
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:31,588
Nothing good.

580
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,096
No! ELIOT: Margo!

581
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,103
She's destroying the keys!

582
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,299
I have to.

583
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,070
You don't get to decide that the
whole universe doesn't have magic.

584
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,539
I'll never remember this.

585
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,883
Alice...

586
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,579
Why?

587
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:58,918
You...

588
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,760
You talked me out of
working for the Library.

589
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,420
I realize there's no good side.

590
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,694
Magic just makes people
different shades of bad,

591
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,532
selfish and irresponsible.

592
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,198
We can't handle it!
You can't handle it.

593
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,971
It's wrong.

594
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,304
We're wrong.

595
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,975
And it stops now!

596
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,133
What are you doing?

597
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,368
I'm gonna cut the bitch,

598
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,054
grab her fairy coke power-up,

599
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,127
and fix this.

600
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,961
<i>So, where shall we start?</i>

601
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,525
Ocean?

602
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,932
Cute little landmass?

603
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,868
Dealer's choice.

604
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,168
I know you can still feel them.

605
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,732
You need to let them go.

606
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,776
I know, but it's bad.

607
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,738
In a blink, it'll be good again,

608
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,241
and in two blinks,
they'll be long gone.

609
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,953
<i>He's on the floor. He's...</i>

610
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,453
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

611
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,286
<i>He'll die, not giving up.</i>

612
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,624
Can't you feel his heart?

613
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,828
<i>No,</i>

614
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,330
<i>'cause I don't do
what you're doing.</i>

615
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,264
You need to let them go.

616
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,363
Remember the
future we're creating.

617
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,543
Will you play with me?

618
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,313
Hey!

619
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,550
You think you can cast
faster than I can stab? Go!

620
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,700
Please, just listen
to me. The knight...

621
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,022
Ah, shut up the fuck up...

622
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,562
Fix this. Now.

623
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,492
There's no point.

624
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,899
The magic's gone. It's done.

625
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,311
He's right.

626
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,046
Jules.

627
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,219
None of your pain is
what we'd call quiet,

628
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,313
especially yours.

629
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,057
I know you thought this
was for everyone's good.

630
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,995
You'll see someday,

631
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,657
it wasn't.

632
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:23,725
For now, I need you
to stay out of the way.

633
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,347
I want you to know,
it's your bravery...

634
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,547
Made me see.

635
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,346
See what?

636
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,221
What I need to do.

637
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,463
What are you doing?

638
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,790
What Prometheus did.

639
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,563
Whore-crotching.

640
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,565
Horcruxing. Oh.

641
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,071
Look, Jules, are you sure?

642
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,600
Julia, you could
lose your power.

643
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,625
Hurry. PENNY: You okay?

644
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,230
Okay, okay.

645
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,637
Hey, I got you. I got you.

646
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,968
Come on.

647
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,768
Are you okay?

648
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,443
It hurt.

649
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,715
And I'm not connected
to anything anymore.

650
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,350
I got you. MARGO:
Are you guys ready?

651
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:23,181
Match it with the key.

652
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,857
Let's do this.

653
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,333
Dean Fogg?

654
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,569
Travel, Penny, I kill them all.

655
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,310
Irene...

656
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,088
We do have a deal.

657
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,591
Unless you want to have
a problem with the Library.

658
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,756
The very essence is altered

659
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,908
by the slightest
deviation in finger position.

660
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,006
Watch closely.

661
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,957
The difference is in the
position of the right middle finger.

662
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,192
Sorry, looks like
we're having another...

663
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,157
Power issue.

664
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,701
The rations are
wholly inadequate.

665
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,964
I can't even assign homework!

666
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,702
Do the best you can.

667
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,668
I'll attempt to
renegotiate for our supply.

668
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:58,768
How?

669
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,857
I'm afraid we can't revisit
your supply until next quarter.

670
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,577
I've spoken to the Board.

671
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,908
Which Board?

672
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,161
North American Fourth District.

673
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,710
Calgary enrollment

674
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,756
hasn't bounced back
the way we have.

675
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,654
They're barely using
2/3 of their allotment,

676
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,886
and they've offered it to us.

677
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,785
Both you and they need to
bring a written request to...

678
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:22,826
In triplicate.

679
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,130
You'll have a
decision by the 31st.

680
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,299
Excellent.

681
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,835
There's just one more request.

682
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,012
My answer hasn't changed.

683
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,180
She made a deal
with us, then broke it.

684
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,645
Unlike the others,

685
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,707
she belongs to the Library.

686
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,487
I just would like to see her.

687
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,387
Please.

688
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,559
Where are they?

689
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,361
Per the deal, as
struck with The Order,

690
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,862
safe.

691
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,331
No, no, no, no, no, they're not.

692
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,170
Alice, the McAllistairs
can't find them,

693
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,204
and if they try,

694
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,043
the Library's
retribution will be swift.

695
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,879
Not the McAllistairs!
That thing!

696
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,749
It can jump bodies, I told you.

697
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,878
You should know,

698
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,852
that alone is a very
dangerous ability.

699
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,668
If they don't know who they are,

700
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,892
if they don't have magic,
they can't protect themselves.

701
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,460
Okay.

702
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,220
Hypothetically,

703
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,391
this thing gets loose.

704
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,062
Why would it go after them?

705
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,196
It's seen them.

706
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,073
It knows magic is back.

707
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,903
It knows they're
Magicians, even if they don't.

708
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,849
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

709
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,325
Sophie, hit pause on
your idiocy for a sec.

710
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,156
Janet?

711
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,092
Hi, I'm Isaac.

712
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,938
You're late. Me, too.

713
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:10,265
Uh, luckily, I don't recognize
the legality of red lights.

714
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,545
Quentin.

715
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:24,807
I found you.

716
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,574
Oh, uh...

717
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,016
No, sorry, I'm Brian.

718
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,683
Do a card trick for me, Quentin.

719
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,020
Come on.

720
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,361
Will you play with me?

721
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,297
Uh, I'm sorry, I
think you've got me

722
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,447
mistaken for somebody else,

723
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,764
but I... You know...

724
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,363
<i>I saw it.</i>

725
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,963
<i>I've felt it!</i>

726
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,032
Even the gods are afraid of it.

727
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,143
This is your fault, just
as much as it is mine.

728
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,909
Get me out of here!

729
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:01,353
Help me stop it.

730
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,764
Don't be scared.

731
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,369
This is great!

732
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,108
There's so much
for us to do together.

733
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,138
I can't wait to get started

734
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,975
on all the people

735
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,175
who really deserve our wrath.

736
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,111
Um, no, look, please, I'm not...

737
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,048
This is gonna be so fun.

738
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,986
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.
