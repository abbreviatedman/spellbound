00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,609
<i>Previously on</i>
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:11,132
I'll send you
on an epic quest.

3
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:12,789
Q, I think this is it.

4
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:14,406
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

5
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,756
Okay, if fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

6
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:18,874
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

7
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:20,152
that I met back in Athens
one time.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,920
You mean Prometheus? 
He's dead.

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,030
Damn it!

10
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,132
He told me
this crazy story one time

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:27,886
about how there was, like,
a secret back door

12
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:29,180
to magic.

13
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:30,311
<i>I have...</i>

14
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>magic.</i>

15
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,666
I have to be able
to do something with it.

16
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:35,597
I planted a seed
for you to grow.

17
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:37,713
<i>It doesn't matter
where it comes from.</i>

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,964
<i>It matters what you do
with it.</i>

19
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,948
<i>"The Tale
of the Seven Keys,"</i>

20
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,518
<i>chapter eight.</i>

21
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,097
<i>The Knight remained imprisoned</i>

22
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:03,130
<i>at the Castle
at the End of the World.</i>

23
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:05,303
<i>Not even a warrior
as great as he</i>

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>could break the bonds
placed on him</i>

25
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,175
<i>by the Witch.</i>

26
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:09,839
<i>He could not escape.</i>

27
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,590
<i>But his daughter,
now every bit</i>

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,793
<i>the knight her father was,</i>

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,751
<i>and more so,
never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:19,230
<i>She fought monsters,
real and imagined,</i>

31
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,487
<i>without as well as within.</i>

32
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,759
<i>She had won all seven keys,</i>

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,410
<i>and now she set sail</i>

34
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:27,017
<i>for the Castle at
the End of the World.</i>

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,369
Okay, tick-tock.

36
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,852
Does it say where
the castle is?

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,593
Shh, Bambi.
Let him read.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,247
Just saying, andale.

39
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:37,253
Okay, so she faces the door
of the castle.

40
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,254
In the door,
there were seven keyholes.

41
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,735
The door swallowed
the keys whole

42
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,393
and slowly opened.

43
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,761
Up ahead, she saw her father,
bound by seven chains.

44
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:49,839
"Father," she cried,
"I'm here to save you."

45
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:52,219
<i>She placed the keys
into the locks,</i>

46
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,460
<i>and when she turned
the seventh...</i>

47
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:54,604
Sorry, time out.

48
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:56,387
I thought the weird door

49
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:57,537
swallowed the keys.

50
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,941
Yeah, no, it did, but then...
she has done again.

51
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,577
I'm not that drunk.

52
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,365
This is sloppy plotting.

53
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,668
Or it's a paradox.

54
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,195
- Hmm.
- That's a clue.

55
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,671
Oh, we're... ed.

56
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,801
The... ing Library

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,981
is ready to swoop in

58
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:14,201
with a...
What's it called?

59
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,807
Siphon,
and it's not that simple.

60
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:18,463
Takes a lot of power
to charge it,

61
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,661
and they don't have those kind
of reserves just lying around,

62
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,250
thanks to Julia
freeing those fairies.

63
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,734
Yeah, well, it's the Library.
They'll think of something.

64
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,472
All we gotta do
is beat them to it.

65
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,050
I mean,
their window of time

66
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,487
to even use the, uh,
whatchamacallit

67
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,738
is super short, right?

68
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,787
Less than a minute,
once we turn the key.

69
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:37,006
There you go.
Get all this done before...

70
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,791
Our Lady of the Tree,
help us.

71
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,066
Please, help me!

72
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:43,972
Hi, Julia.

73
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,624
Pleasure to finally meet you.

74
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,796
I'm Iris,
messenger goddess,

75
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:50,214
bon vivant, rainbow aficionado.

76
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:51,844
Let's chat.

77
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:53,585
Who's...

78
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,460
Our Lady of the Tree?

79
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,849
You are.

80
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,416
I presume they mean

81
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,334
the trees you brought back
in Fillory.

82
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:03,175
Lovely act of penance.
Good moniker for you.

83
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,658
Just what are you saying?

84
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,256
You fulfilled the task
Our Lady Underground gave you...

85
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,906
To grow the spark...

86
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,694
And now you are the flame.

87
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,388
So I'm...

88
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:17,058
A full-on goddess, correct.

89
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:19,654
Holy shit.

90
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,421
We have a lot of work

91
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,303
to do, love,
all very exciting.

92
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,403
I'm sort of
in the middle of this quest.

93
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,569
Oh, that.
They can take it from here.

94
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,186
Your concerns
are greater now.

95
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:33,640
Your duty to them is over.

96
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:37,138
And by the way,
so is all that pain.

97
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,167
You can put it down.

98
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:41,353
Okay.

99
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,952
I mean, should I, like, bow?

100
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,827
No.
I mean, I'm still me.

101
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:46,547
Well, you're clearly not.

102
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,180
I mean, it's been kind of hard

103
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,731
to ignore
the nuclear power plant

104
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:53,285
radiating off you
the last couple weeks.

105
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:54,723
I don't know, just...

106
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:57,102
wanted us to finish this
together, you know?

107
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:59,278
Mm, me too, but...

108
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,478
I mean, let's be honest, like,

109
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:02,995
you deserve this.

110
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,166
Why me?

111
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:06,997
Life is unfair,

112
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,334
but I'm good with it
occasionally working out

113
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:11,786
for people that I actually love.

114
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,473
Our Lady of the Tree.

115
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,223
No, it's good.

116
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,771
Yeah, it's good.

117
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:22,939
It's formal.

118
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,122
Very formal.

119
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,722
I'm gonna miss you too.

120
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:46,080
What was that?

121
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,249
It's enough juice for a one-off spell.

122
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:49,830
You know, just in case, like,

123
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:53,301
a giant "Indiana Jones" boulder
comes hurtling at you.

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,117
You can fight it off.

125
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,872
I love you, Jules.

126
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,527
I love you too.

127
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,161
Goodbye, Quentin.

129
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,395
Any headway?

130
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,181
Well, wasted a few hours

131
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:43,786
looking at castles, but...

132
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,784
think I'm onto something,

133
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:47,285
or someone,

134
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,770
who could help us.

135
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,774
I've been tripping on this, hard.

136
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:56,193
It's the witch, in the castle,
sitting at a table,

137
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,749
on which another, smaller, castle...

138
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,798
- Yeah?
- Well, either this is some.

139
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,600
M.C. Escher, "the castle
goes on forever" shit,

140
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,778
or that picture means something.

141
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,606
Do you see these?

142
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,293
These are drafting tools

143
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,934
for architects.

144
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:14,659
Right, she's the architect that...

145
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,733
that Reynard talked about,
that she's... oh, my God,

146
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,702
she's the one that, uh...
she made the prison

147
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,050
for the mistakes of the gods,

148
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,549
and she... she hid it.

149
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,997
She knows where it is.

150
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:28,848
We need to find her, Q.

151
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,127
There are, like, 50 minor gods
of architecture and the arts.

152
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:35,473
Well, come at me. Let's
get 'em all down here.

153
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,085
I mean, full-on goddess, huh?

154
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,787
Look, I mean, I get that

155
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,235
Julia has been through some shit,

156
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:44,591
but seriously, it just seems random.

157
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,694
So it's like life, then?

158
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,661
I don't know. I'm happy for her.

159
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,896
Me too. Might as well be.

160
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:53,943
Well, I'd be happier if she
stayed, so she could help us.

161
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,910
Look, she seemed pretty positive that
we could do this without her, so...

162
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:58,551
You forgot Calypso.

163
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,094
Like the musical style?

164
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,364
The witch that imprisoned Odysseus.

165
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:05,878
And I love you, El, but how
the hell did you pass AP Lit

166
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,981
- without ever reading?
- I didn't.

167
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,829
So, according to the story,

168
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,536
she was a nymph, which...

169
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,433
not a god, but I assume
a pretty powerful creature,

170
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,755
considering she had him in lockdown

171
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,437
for, like, seven full years

172
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:20,171
on an island called Ogai...

173
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,393
Ogiji?

174
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,395
- Ogijia?
- Ogygia.

175
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,710
However that's pronounced.

176
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:25,831
Cool. Great.

177
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,279
So do we book tickets?

178
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,633
No, it's not...

179
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,782
it's not a real place.

180
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,181
Hold on, okay, so...

181
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:32,770
Ogai... ogaiga,

182
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:33,984
or however you say it,

183
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,305
is a island

184
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,388
um, in the fictional tale
of "The Odyssey."

185
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:40,122
It's a clothing label,

186
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:42,606
a Eurovision band,

187
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,328
a tech company... they make games.

188
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:45,473
Oh, my God.

189
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,851
I know them. I worship them.

190
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,999
They're the Candy Collider people.

191
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,955
I nearly spent $600 on level 593.

192
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,357
It took me 12 straight days.

193
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,339
There are prisons, and
there are prisons.

194
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:57,794
Right?

195
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,744
We're all just 24/7, "Like my post."

196
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,512
Beep-boop! Selfie!

197
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,966
Right?

198
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:05,901
No one's... No one...

199
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:07,082
Okay, so the CEO

200
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,118
is a woman named Callie.

201
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:11,989
Great. Vámonos.

202
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,314
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

203
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,482
because I promised Prometheus I would,

204
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,465
and I would never break my word to him,

205
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,487
but for the record, I'm not a fan.

206
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,324
Of you, this big magic quest,
the whole... ing thing.

207
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,727
It's the reason Prometheus is dead.

208
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:34,275
So as far as I'm concerned,

209
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:36,377
you're a big part of why he's dead.

210
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,998
No, I... we don't...

211
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,654
Yeah, of course you don't.

212
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:40,914
You're humans.

213
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,983
Little human Magicians.

214
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,876
He loved you so.

215
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,647
All right, here it is.

216
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:54,127
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

217
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,882
To design a prison that secure

218
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,414
<i>for clients of that caliber...</i>

219
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,240
<i>When I explained that I would
need the most steadfast jailors,</i>

220
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:12,011
<i>Prometheus offered to help find them,</i>

221
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,966
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

222
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,398
<i>Always was good at quests.</i>

223
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,772
So you trapped some poor girl

224
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,921
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

225
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,976
She's there of her own will,

226
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:26,357
as was her father,

227
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:29,480
who offered himself
as, well, bait, really.

228
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:33,383
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

229
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,465
I gave them each an opportunity

230
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:38,737
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

231
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,090
I assure you,

232
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,605
she can leave if she wishes.

233
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,721
I wouldn't have it any other way.

234
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:46,309
Surely the quest has taught you,

235
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,936
sacrifice is part of everything.

236
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:52,822
Um, so when, uh, Prometheus

237
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,051
was looking to hide his back door...

238
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,745
I had already designed
the perfect place.

239
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:00,353
A place full of monsters

240
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:02,571
where no one wants to look.

241
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,550
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

242
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,135
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

243
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,469
who couldn't ensure it remained secure.

244
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:15,123
<i>He channeled every atom of power</i>

245
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,794
<i>into the keys.</i>

246
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,358
<i>So he, like, Horcruxed himself?</i>

247
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:20,706
<i>Jesus.</i>

248
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,956
<i>Someone got bit hard by the martyr bug.</i>

249
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:25,221
<i>All I can say is he believed in you.</i>

250
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,697
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

251
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,634
<i>when you would save us</i>

252
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,938
<i>if you had magic.</i>

253
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,305
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

254
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,554
<i>What... what does that mean?</i>

255
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:36,109
Guess we'll find out,

256
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,157
if you get to the end.

257
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,660
He gave everything for you,

258
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:43,315
<i>and then his enemies came,</i>

259
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,317
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

260
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,286
<i>With his power gone,</i>

261
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:49,288
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

262
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,154
<i>and they were strong.</i>

263
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:15,345
Sorry.

264
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,052
It was a long time ago.

265
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,484
So you don't suppose

266
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:22,399
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

267
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:26,323
and/or how to get in?

268
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,622
I've waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

269
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,213
Wait, this looks like...

270
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,102
is that Fillory?

271
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,937
It's upside-down.

272
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,286
Looked like that before
Ember and Umber got there,

273
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,955
when it was just a distant,
wild little world.

274
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,176
Oh, my God.

275
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:50,012
There's a...

276
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,114
a theory about Castle Whitespire,

277
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,428
that the dwarves based it on

278
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:54,621
the most perfect design

279
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,758
that they'd ever seen,

280
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,285
a castle called...

281
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,287
Blackspire, but Ember destroyed it.

282
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,270
More like flipped the whole thing over

283
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:03,071
and started over on the other side.

284
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,506
So my castle is based on your prison?

285
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:06,694
What can I say?

286
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:10,178
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

287
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:12,180
So Blackspire's still there,

288
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,015
it's just... underneath.

289
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:15,913
Yes.

290
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,399
Good luck with your quest.

291
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,243
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, lady, come on.

292
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:22,265
- How do we get in? The key paradox.
- Let me get one thing clear:

293
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,424
everything I put the girl through,

294
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,843
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

295
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,324
You'll find your way in,

296
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:32,957
and you'll find a way to do it safely
and securely, but whatever you do,

297
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,988
there's one simple thing

298
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,728
you need to understand
above everything else.

299
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,590
What's locked inside that castle...

300
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:47,203
Can never, ever be allowed to escape.

301
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,407
Begging pardon,

302
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:56,213
we need your official permission.

303
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:59,533
As acting High King.

304
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:03,954
Oh, you have my permission
to implement the new schedule.

305
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,276
Excellent, Your acting Majesty.

306
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,491
And if it's no trouble,

307
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:09,959
bring the tax collector's

308
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,294
latest expense reports.

309
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,997
I would like to double-check them.

310
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,584
Sorry.

311
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,251
Of course. Right away.

312
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:28,530
You need to stop apologizing.

313
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:30,012
You'd do well to remember,

314
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,981
that power comes from High King Margo,

315
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,137
but it flows through you.

316
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:36,985
Is there something you need?

317
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,239
Yes.

318
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:41,108
Six fairies have disappeared
in two days.

319
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,157
And how are you certain this is...

320
00:13:43,244 --> 00:13:44,545
I found this.

321
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,494
I believe it's a part
of a magical device

322
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:51,690
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

323
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:54,468
There is no magic.

324
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:57,028
Someone's hunting my people.

325
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,353
What is this?

326
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,973
My lab,

327
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,655
where I come to think,

328
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:19,178
answer texts, create worlds.

329
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,313
Wait, do I get to create worlds?

330
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,148
I mean, we'll start with one.

331
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,030
You'll split your time between the lab

332
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:27,199
and answering the prayers
of your choice.

333
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:28,367
But I'll be blunt.

334
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:29,588
The work we do here

335
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,236
is much more vital to the big picture,

336
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,357
but we find that morale stays higher

337
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,689
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

338
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,378
One more thing.

339
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,333
My friends...

340
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,365
How come I can still feel them?

341
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,052
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

342
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,674
Q is stressing, and Fen...

343
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:54,224
I know that she wants to help
save these fairies' lives but...

344
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,113
This is the discipline.

345
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,195
You need to keep from being seduced.

346
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:01,051
You're wasted if you expend
too much energy

347
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:03,186
trying to look after every last fairy

348
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:04,434
when you could be building

349
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,155
and shaping worlds

350
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:08,604
where no fairy ever comes to harm.

351
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,156
Why don't I show you?

352
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,135
<i>So do we think the knight chick</i>

353
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,582
is somehow still in there?

354
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,037
It's god magic,

355
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,140
so anything's possible.

356
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,189
We really don't know
what could be in there.

357
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:28,290
I'll Travel in.

358
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,544
Excuse us for caring, but no.

359
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,148
We don't know what
you'd be blipping into,

360
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:35,230
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

361
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,431
from the last Penny.

362
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,153
Okay.

363
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,321
Say we do find some window.

364
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,920
We know this knight is gonna help us?

365
00:15:58,414 --> 00:15:59,428
Hi.

366
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,707
You're asleep.

367
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:02,738
I'm in your head, not his.

368
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,442
It's a dream.

369
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:15,137
You have magic.

370
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:16,721
Had.

371
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,119
Uh, it's sort of a one-off.

372
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:21,759
- Listen...
- Ora.

373
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,731
I'm Quentin.

374
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:26,631
I need your help.

375
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,907
You're here about the fountain?
The back door to magic?

376
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,367
Yeah.

377
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,748
I can't help.

378
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:32,941
Uh, because you're

379
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,138
- guarding all the...
- No.

380
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:35,620
They're all gone.

381
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:38,655
He's the only one left.

382
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:40,936
Did they all die, or?

383
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:42,579
He killed them all.

384
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,249
You can't imagine what he's capable of.

385
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,040
That's why I can't do anything for you.

386
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:49,283
I cannot risk the security of my charge.

387
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,771
I get that.

388
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,819
I have something to offer you too.

389
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,062
Julia gave you a hit
of magic, and you did what?

390
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,643
Incepted the knight in the castle.

391
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,631
That magic was for killing a monster.

392
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,466
Why waste it on chatting with the help?

393
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:05,847
When Calypso told us that Ora

394
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,635
was there on her own accord,

395
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,438
I... I figured she must know
more than one way

396
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,140
in and out of the castle, and she does,

397
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:13,574
and she's going to open it for us.

398
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:14,689
In exchange for...

399
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,725
All you have to do is get in,

400
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:17,793
turn the key,

401
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,128
and get out fast.

402
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,482
Um, what about the monster?

403
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,748
- Ora will take care of the monster.
- What about you?

404
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:28,155
I stay in the castle.

405
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,425
It's a fair deal.

406
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,875
She's been there for centuries,

407
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:36,303
and she's tired,
and I'm... I'm strong enough,

408
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:38,098
thanks to the quest,

409
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,465
so I'm the new jailor.

410
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:42,141
- This isn't the solution.
- I second that.

411
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,289
Alice, who's the one that died for us?

412
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,590
You were willing to stay in Fillory

413
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,559
for forever. How is this different?

414
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,145
Someone has to step up.

415
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,894
Quick alternative pitch: take the
gun with the god-killing bullet

416
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:57,182
and shoot the... ing monster
in the face.

417
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:58,476
Second second that, yes.

418
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,095
No.
I-I promised, no clever stuff.

419
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,602
It's more bloody and straightforward.

420
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:06,116
Look, this monster,

421
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:07,826
it's not a joke.

422
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:11,277
We cannot let it escape, and the only
way to make sure that it doesn't

423
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,178
is to do this the hard way.

424
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,834
The quest taught us
that it's like that sometimes.

425
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,553
I don't like this.

426
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,344
Me neither,

427
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,875
but I'm going to do it.

428
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,503
Hello, love.

429
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,349
Oh, shit.

430
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,850
It's a human.

431
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,860
It's also the current ruler of Fillory.

432
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:48,008
Hello.

433
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,457
We've met,

434
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:50,941
so we can get right to the part

435
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,574
where I tell you to stop

436
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:54,354
stealing fairies to chop up.

437
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,518
They are full citizens of Fillory.

438
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,153
You will cease at once.

439
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,846
Full citizens. Well, la Di da.

440
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:06,327
- Escort them to the...
- Ah, ah, ah.

441
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:07,881
Know what a traveler is?

442
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:12,150
We can blip on out of here and go
about our beeswax anytime we please.

443
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,070
I have something you very much need

444
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,263
in the castle.

445
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:27,033
They won't be but a moment.

446
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,515
And may I say, sir,

447
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,371
how much I admire your suit.

448
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,018
I've been passing bunnies with Margo.

449
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,522
They are very close
to turning magic back on.

450
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,176
Hooray for them.

451
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,843
And you must know

452
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,392
the reason Irene is poaching fairies

453
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,127
is she needs a huge amount of energy

454
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,317
to power a... a thing
that must be placed

455
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:47,599
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

456
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,134
Let me save your breath.

457
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,203
I don't care.

458
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,924
You should.

459
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,274
If we keep her long enough, we can
stop her from derailing magic

460
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,729
and taking it for herself

461
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:58,980
and for the Library.

462
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,971
This is the future we're talking about.

463
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,158
Not our future.

464
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:04,208
I cannot risk another soul.

465
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:10,243
I know exactly how to deal with this.

466
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,925
<i>So, what are you offering, exactly?</i>

467
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,713
I broke a deal.

468
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,379
It's my fault we're vulnerable.

469
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,720
I offer you the magic of 50 fairies

470
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,700
with a single body.

471
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:28,228
You know the power of royal marrow.

472
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:31,041
You're volunteering to die?

473
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:33,444
In exchange for a new agreement.

474
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,114
- Wait.
- No fairy will be hunted

475
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,403
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

476
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,377
and this deal cannot be broken,

477
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:43,612
for any reason,

478
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,603
by any being, ever.

479
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,518
Swear to that,

480
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,502
and you have me.

481
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,017
Time is of the essence.

482
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,284
My offer expires in one minute.

483
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:00,804
<i>I'm gonna need a table</i>

484
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:01,939
with restraints,

485
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,635
uh, a bone saw, knives, and a grinder.

486
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,234
There must be another way.

487
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,236
The deal I struck with Irene

488
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,085
will finally make it possible

489
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:19,025
for my people to be safe and free.

490
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,976
Tears for your enemy?

491
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,377
<i>Any day now.</i>

492
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:44,831
<i>My God.</i>

493
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,467
Where did it turn out to be? Alice?

494
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,860
This Castle at the End of the World?

495
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:52,338
Fillory. Underneath.

496
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,273
Castle Blackspire.

497
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,039
- How did you...
- I was a fan, too, once.

498
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:02,748
I need a favor.

499
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,917
I have this,

500
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:06,097
and I know it's wrong,

501
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,501
and I'll never use it again,
but I need it.

502
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:10,601
To?

503
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,504
I hear you have an experimental potion

504
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:15,342
that not only wipes your memory,

505
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,809
but creates a whole new persona.

506
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:20,465
I do, but what?

507
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,934
I'll always be tempted.

508
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:26,351
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

509
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,886
unless I have no memory.

510
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,208
Alice,

511
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:34,044
you are...

512
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:38,034
you are one of the most
brilliant Magicians

513
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:39,331
I've ever seen.

514
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,923
I didn't choose to be!

515
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,650
I want to live my life,

516
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:48,071
not how my parents raised me to think,

517
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,359
or what you taught me,

518
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,060
or what the Library wants me to do.

519
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:53,343
I'm not sure if that's
the best path to happiness.

520
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,328
What if there is no best path?

521
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:58,803
I don't know.

522
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,298
All I know is the one I'm on
is a bad one...

523
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,796
And I'm stepping off.

524
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,295
Once you've...

525
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:30,431
Yes?

526
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:31,899
Drink this.

527
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:33,867
Give it about a full day

528
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,383
for everything to get rebooted.

529
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,005
After that,

530
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:40,604
you are on your own.

531
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,960
Thank you.

532
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,194
So?

533
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:04,129
We need to talk

534
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,794
about our arrangement.

535
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:29,808
You tell anyone else?

536
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:32,712
Please don't.

537
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:34,805
Of course not.

538
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:39,392
You're the only one that I...

539
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,703
wanted... had to tell.

540
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,489
Look, I know that I don't show it

541
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:49,605
or act like it all the time,

542
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:50,811
but...

543
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,485
but you're...

544
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:56,112
you're the one that I love, Q.

545
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,347
You're the one.

546
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:03,286
And the only thing I'm going to
regret is not remembering that.

547
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,089
Well...

548
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,054
Well, I'll remember for the both of us.

549
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:48,223
You made a deal you will regret.

550
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,328
You'll never know.

551
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:54,690
True.

552
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,612
But I'll die a queen,

553
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:59,873
not some mediocre, power-hungry girl.

To be entertained.

583
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:31,767
Served, coddled.

584
00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:33,222
Loved.

585
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,972
Loved, like...

586
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,327
A child.

587
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:40,085
Okay, that's better
than my first thought.

588
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,776
Right now, he thinks
we're playing a game.

589
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:42,993
Hide and seek.

590
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,224
It's the only way to ensure
he'd stay diverted long enough

591
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,560
to let you in, and right
now, he's getting bored.

592
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:54,152
What's up?

593
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:58,293
In case I get held up.

594
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,506
Don't.

595
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:01,326
Hear me?

596
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,450
You got this, okay?

597
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,094
My love?

598
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:16,527
I found you! I tag you!

599
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,032
Give it a moment.

600
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:23,984
Does it have a name?

601
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,848
No.

602
00:28:28,528 --> 00:28:30,710
What makes it so dangerous?

603
00:28:30,797 --> 00:28:33,159
The gods created something
that simply...

604
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:34,680
wants.

605
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,196
So it has to know one secure place

606
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:37,330
and constant love.

607
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,451
If not,

608
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:39,932
if its appetite goes unfed

609
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,154
and it's unleashed,

610
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,253
even the gods can't stop it.

611
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:49,161
Love?

612
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:50,395
Come out!

613
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,211
Did you fall asleep?

614
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,663
Yeah, but what can it do?

615
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:08,460
Will you play with me?

616
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,196
Eliot! No!

617
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,416
Oh! No.

618
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,373
- Fuck, Eliot...
- How?

619
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,852
God-killing bullet.

620
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,776
This is not what we agreed on.

621
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:52,854
I didn't actually agree on anything,

622
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,931
but I did decide that
one of my best friends

623
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:57,487
wouldn't spend the rest of
his life locked in a prison,

624
00:29:57,574 --> 00:30:00,120
guarding what turns out to be a
really not-so-scary monster.

625
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,914
Wait, where'd she go?

626
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:10,565
Anyway, it's done.

627
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:13,052
You spent a little bit
too much time as a king.

628
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:15,134
Well, that's really not
the issue now, is it?

629
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,557
Could've used some Goo
Gone and a toothbrush,

630
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,401
- but I think we're good to go.
- All right, let's go.

631
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,523
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- All right bitches,

632
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,110
everyone grab a key.

633
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:31,863
Alice, what are you doing?

634
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,566
Nothing good.

635
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:36,184
- No!
- Margo!

636
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,506
She's destroying the keys!

637
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,661
I have to.

638
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:45,651
You don't get to decide that the
whole universe doesn't have magic.

639
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,083
I'll never remember this.

640
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,851
Alice...

641
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:58,609
why?

642
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,577
You...

643
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,506
you talked me out of
working for the Library.

644
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:07,178
I realize there's no good side.

645
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:10,100
Magic just makes people
different shades of bad,

646
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,889
selfish and irresponsible.

647
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:14,070
We can't handle it!

648
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:15,606
You can't handle it.

649
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:17,293
It's wrong.

650
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,894
We're wrong.

651
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:21,220
And it stops now!

652
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,442
What are you doing?

653
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:34,689
I'm gonna cut the bitch,

654
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:38,349
grab her fairy coke
power-up, and fix this.

655
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,564
<i>So, where shall we start?</i>

656
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:42,883
Ocean?

657
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,785
Cute little landmass?

658
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:46,150
Dealer's choice.

659
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:50,539
I know you can still feel them.

660
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:52,659
You need to let them go.

661
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,428
I know, but it's bad.

662
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,430
In a blink, it'll be good again,

663
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,796
and in two blinks, they'll be long gone.

664
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:02,836
<i>He's on the floor. He's...</i>

665
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:04,771
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

666
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:07,107
<i>He'll die, not giving up.</i>

667
00:32:07,578 --> 00:32:09,138
Can't you feel his heart?

668
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,111
<i>No,</i>

669
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:13,843
<i>'cause I don't do what you're doing.</i>

670
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,288
You need to let them go.

671
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,884
Remember the future we're creating.

672
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:32,661
Will you play with me?

673
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,369
- Hey!
- Ah!

674
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,603
You think you can cast

675
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,884
faster than I can stab? Go!

676
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:43,382
- Please, listen to me. The knight...
- Ah, shut the... up and...

677
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:48,667
- Fix this.
- Now.

678
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,093
There's no point.

679
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,499
The magic's gone. It's done.

680
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,101
He's right.

681
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,495
Jules.

682
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:09,085
None of your pain
is what we'd call quiet,

683
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:11,343
especially yours.

684
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,382
I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

685
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:18,776
You'll see someday,

686
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:20,100
it wasn't.

687
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,090
For now,

688
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,137
I need you to stay out of the way.

689
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,890
I want you to know, it's your bravery...

690
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,038
made me see.

691
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:44,852
See what?

692
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,950
What I need to do.

693
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:54,344
What are you doing?

694
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,429
What Prometheus did.

695
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:58,070
Whore-crotching.

696
00:33:58,157 --> 00:34:00,025
- Horcruxing.
- Oh.

697
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:01,908
- Look, Jules, are you sure?
- Shh.

698
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:04,259
Julia, you could lose your power.

699
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:02,313
- Hurry.
- You okay?

700
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:08,546
Okay, okay.

701
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,022
Hey, I got you. I got you.

702
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:12,093
Come on.

703
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,509
Are you okay?

704
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:15,507
It hurt.

705
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,390
And I'm not con...
connected to anything anymore.

706
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:23,398
- I got you.
- Are you guys ready?

707
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,479
Let's do this.

708
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,596
Dean Fogg?

709
00:36:18,796 --> 00:36:20,491
Travel, Penny,

710
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,356
I kill them all.

711
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,820
Irene...

712
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,838
We do have a deal.

713
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:09,267
Unless you want to have
a problem with the Library.

714
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:29,236
<i>The very essence is altered</i>

715
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:32,878
by the slightest deviation in
finger position. Watch closely.

716
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:40,049
The difference is in the position
of the right middle finger.

717
00:37:43,204 --> 00:37:46,300
Sorry, looks like we're
having another...

718
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:48,989
power issue.

719
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:52,940
The rations are wholly inadequate.
I can't even assign homework!

720
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,492
Do the best you can.

721
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:57,888
I'll attempt to renegotiate
for our supply.

722
00:37:58,212 --> 00:37:59,278
How?

723
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:03,868
I'm afraid we can't revisit
your supply until next quarter.

724
00:38:03,955 --> 00:38:05,531
I've spoken to the Board.

725
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,703
- Which Board?
- North American Fourth District.

726
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:11,117
Calgary enrollment hasn't
bounced back the way we have.

727
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,153
They're barely using
2/3 of their allotment,

728
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,342
and they've offered it to us.

729
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:18,416
Both you and they need
to bring a written request to...

730
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,421
In triplicate.

731
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,635
You'll have a decision by the 31st.

732
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:30,089
Excellent.

733
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,572
There's just one more request.

734
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,626
My answer hasn't changed.

735
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,675
She made a deal with us, then broke it.

736
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:38,143
Unlike the others,

737
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,303
she belongs to the Library.

738
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,340
I just would like to see her.

739
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,225
Please.

740
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,349
Where are they?

741
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,314
Per the... deal,

742
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,196
as struck with the Order,

743
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:00,651
safe.

744
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,434
No, no, no, no, no, they're not.

745
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:07,037
Alice, the McAllistairs can't find them,

746
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:08,658
and if they try,

747
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:10,540
the Library's retribution will be swift.

748
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:12,208
Not the McAllistairs!

749
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,329
That thing!

750
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:16,695
It can jump bodies, I told you.
You should know,

751
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,814
that alone is a very dangerous ability.

752
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:21,821
If they don't know who they
are, if they don't have magic,

753
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:23,195
they can't protect themselves.

754
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:24,982
Okay.

755
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:26,722
Hypothetically,

756
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:29,343
this thing gets loose.

757
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,804
Why would it go after them?

758
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:35,835
It's seen them.

759
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:38,812
It knows magic is back.

760
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:42,495
It knows they're Magicians,
even if they don't.

761
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:53,937
Sophie, hit pause
on your idiocy for a sec.

762
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:55,336
Janet?

763
00:39:55,423 --> 00:39:57,676
Hi, I'm Isaac.

764
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,614
You're late. Me, too.

765
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:10,914
Uh, luckily, I don't recognize
the legality of red lights.

766
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:24,119
Quentin.

767
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:25,597
I found you.

768
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,038
No, sorry, I'm Brian.

769
00:41:30,445 --> 00:41:32,323
Do a card trick for me, Quentin.

770
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,795
Come on.

771
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:40,802
Will you play with me?

772
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,703
I'm sorry, I think you've got me

773
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,343
mistaken for somebody else,
but I... you know...

774
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:47,808
<i>I saw it.</i>

775
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:49,376
<i>I've felt it!</i>

776
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,675
Even the gods are afraid of it.

777
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:55,596
This is your fault,
just as much as it is mine.

778
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,547
Get me out of here!

779
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:02,418
Help me stop it.

780
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:20,251
Don't be scared.

781
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,807
This is great!

782
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:24,890
There's so much for us to do together.

783
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,546
I can't wait to get started

784
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:31,547
on... all the people
who really deserve our wrath.

785
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,732
Um, no, look, please, I'm not... I...

786
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,594
This is gonna be so fun.

787
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:40,527
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.
