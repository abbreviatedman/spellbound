1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,607
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:05,364
I'll send you on an epic quest.

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,699
Q, I think this is it.

4
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:08,535
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

5
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:10,871
Okay, if fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

6
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,706
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

7
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:14,208
that I met back in Athens one time.

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:16,066
You mean Prometheus? He's dead.

9
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:17,128
Damn it!

10
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:19,212
He told me this crazy story one time

11
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,814
about how there was, like,
a secret back door

12
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:23,249
to magic.

13
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:24,317
<i>I have...</i>

14
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:25,617
<i>magic.</i>

15
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:27,653
I have to be able
to do something with it.

16
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:29,455
I planted a seed for you to grow.

17
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:31,724
<i>It doesn't matter where it comes from.</i>

18
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,625
<i>It matters what you do with it.</i>

19
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:48,573
<i>"The Tale of the Seven Keys,"</i>

20
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,441
<i>chapter eight.</i>

21
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,145
<i>The Knight remained imprisoned</i>

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,147
<i>at the Castle at the End of the World.</i>

23
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>Not even a warrior as great as he</i>

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,751
<i>could break the bonds placed on him</i>

25
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,253
<i>by the Witch.</i>

26
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,188
<i>He could not escape.</i>

27
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,490
<i>But his daughter, now every bit</i>

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,791
<i>the knight her father was,</i>

29
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,760
<i>and more so, never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,296
<i>She fought monsters, real and imagined,</i>

31
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,631
<i>without as well as within.</i>

32
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,767
<i>She had won all seven keys,</i>

33
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,937
<i>and now she set sail for the
Castle at the End of the World.</i>

34
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,438
Okay, tick-tock.

35
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,839
Does it say where the castle is?

36
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,608
Shh, Bambi. Let him read.

37
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,276
Just saying, andale.

38
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:31,446
Okay, so she faces the door
of the castle.

39
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,283
<i>In the door, there were seven keyholes.</i>

40
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,718
<i>The door swallowed the keys whole</i>

41
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,653
<i>and slowly opened.</i>

42
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:41,523
<i>Up ahead, she saw her father,
bound by seven chains.</i>

43
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,825
<i>"Father," she cried,
"I'm here to save you."</i>

44
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:46,294
<i>She placed the keys into the locks,</i>

45
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:48,562
<i>- and when she turned the seventh...
- Sorry, time out.</i>

46
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:51,299
I thought the weird door
swallowed the keys.

47
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,666
Yeah, no, it did, but then...

48
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,969
But then she has them again?

49
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,637
I'm not that drunk.

50
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,372
This is sloppy plotting.

51
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:00,707
Or it's a paradox.

52
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,208
- Hmm.
- That's a clue.

53
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:03,709
Oh, we're... ed.

54
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,979
The... ing Library is ready to swoop in

55
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,214
with a... what's it called?

56
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:10,683
Siphon, and it's not that simple.

57
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,429
Takes a lot of power to charge it,

58
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,869
and they don't have those kind
of reserves just lying around,

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,324
thanks to Julia freeing those fairies.

60
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,724
Yeah, well, it's the Library.
They'll think of something.

61
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:21,526
All we gotta do is beat them to it.

62
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:22,861
I mean, their window of time

63
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:25,431
to even use the, uh, whatchamacallit

64
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,967
is super short, right?

65
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,767
Less than a minute,
once we turn the key.

66
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:31,003
There you go.
Get all this done before...

67
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:32,771
<i>Our Lady of the Tree, help us.</i>

68
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,739
<i>Please, help me!</i>

69
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:37,908
Hi, Julia.

70
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,610
Pleasure to finally meet you.

71
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,846
I'm Iris, messenger goddess,

72
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:43,948
bon vivant, rainbow aficionado.

73
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,224
Let's chat.

74
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:47,618
Who's...

75
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:49,454
Our Lady of the Tree?

76
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,888
You are.

77
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:52,456
I presume they mean

78
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,358
the trees you brought back in Fillory.

79
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:56,834
Lovely act of penance.
Good moniker for you.

80
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,696
Just what are you saying?

81
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:03,266
You fulfilled the task
Our Lady Underground gave you...

82
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:04,934
to grow the spark...

83
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:06,703
and now you are the flame.

84
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,438
So I'm...

85
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:10,739
A full-on goddess, correct.

86
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,709
Holy shit.

87
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,378
Shall we go? We have a lot of work

88
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:16,945
to do, love, all very exciting.

89
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,415
I'm sort of in the middle of this quest.

90
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:21,525
Oh, that. They can take it from here.

91
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:24,887
Your concerns are greater now.

92
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:27,322
Your duty to them is over.

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,559
And by the way, so is all that pain.

94
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:32,827
You can put it down.

95
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:35,563
Okay.

96
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:36,764
I mean, should I, like, bow?

97
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:38,733
No. I mean, I'm still me.

98
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,402
Well, you're clearly not.

99
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,070
I mean, it's been kind of hard

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,737
to ignore the nuclear power plant

101
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,439
radiating off you the last couple weeks.

102
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,742
I don't know, just...

103
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:50,777
wanted us to finish this
together, you know?

104
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:53,580
Mm, me too, but...

105
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,349
I mean, let's be honest, like,

106
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,850
you deserve this.

107
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,086
Why me?

108
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,920
Life is unfair,

109
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,988
but I'm good with it
occasionally working out

110
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:05,466
for people that I actually love.

111
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:07,960
Our Lady of the Tree.

112
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,100
No, it's good.

113
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,601
Yeah, it's good.

114
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,769
It's formal.

115
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,802
Very formal.

116
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,442
I'm gonna miss you too.

117
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:39,957
What was that?

118
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:42,126
It's enough juice for a one-off spell.

119
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:43,660
You know, just in case, like,

120
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,131
a giant "Indiana Jones" boulder
comes hurtling at you.

121
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,665
You can fight it off.

122
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,004
I love you, Jules.

123
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:56,872
I love you too.

124
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,717
Goodbye, Quentin.

125
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:32,507
- Any headway?

126
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,176
Well, wasted a few hours

127
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:38,012
looking at castles, but...

128
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:39,614
think I'm onto something,

129
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,115
or someone,

130
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,451
who could help us.

131
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,753
I've been tripping on this, hard.

132
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,023
It's the witch, in the castle,
sitting at a table,

133
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,626
on which another, smaller, castle...

134
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,628
- Yeah?
- Well, either this is some.

135
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:57,430
M.C. Escher, "the castle
goes on forever" shit,

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,765
or that picture means something.

137
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,733
Do you see these?

138
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,068
These are drafting tools

139
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:06,539
for architects.

140
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,740
Right, she's the architect that...

141
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,610
that Reynard talked about,
that she's... oh, my God,

142
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,579
she's the one that, uh...
she made the prison

143
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:14,880
for the mistakes of the gods,

144
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,748
and she... she hid it.

145
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,117
She knows where it is.

146
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:22,528
We need to find her, Q.

147
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:26,957
There are, like, 50 minor gods
of architecture and the arts.

148
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,460
Well, come at me. Let's
get 'em all down here.

149
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,962
I mean, full-on goddess, huh?

150
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:33,664
Look, I mean, I get that

151
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,065
Julia has been through some shit,

152
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:38,468
but seriously, it just seems random.

153
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,571
So it's like life, then?

154
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,673
I don't know. I'm happy for her.

155
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,641
Me too. Might as well be.

156
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,819
Well, I'd be happier if she
stayed, so she could help us.

157
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,745
Look, she seemed pretty positive that
we could do this without her, so...

158
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,582
You forgot Calypso.

159
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:53,916
Like the musical style?

160
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:56,118
The witch that imprisoned Odysseus.

161
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:59,755
And I love you, El, but how
the hell did you pass AP Lit

162
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,924
- without ever reading?
- I didn't.

163
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,659
So, according to the story,

164
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,661
she was a nymph, which...

165
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,263
not a god, but I assume
a pretty powerful creature,

166
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,632
considering she had him in lockdown

167
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,267
for, like, seven full years

168
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:14,001
on an island called Ogai...

169
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:15,270
Ogiji?

170
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,272
- Ogijia?
- Ogygia.

171
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,540
However that's pronounced.

172
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,708
Cool. Great.

173
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,109
So do we book tickets?

174
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,510
No, it's not...

175
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,612
it's not a real place.

176
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,011
Hold on, okay, so...

177
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,647
Ogai... ogaiga,

178
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:27,814
or however you say it,

179
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,182
is a island

180
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,218
um, in the fictional tale
of "The Odyssey."

181
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,820
It's a clothing label,

182
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,690
a Eurovision band,

183
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,158
a tech company... they make games.

184
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,693
Oh, my God.

185
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,728
I know them. I worship them.

186
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,829
They're the Candy Collider people.

187
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,832
I nearly spent $600 on level 593.

188
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,234
It took me 12 straight days.

189
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,169
There are prisons, and
there are prisons.

190
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,671
Right?

191
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,574
We're all just 24/7, "Like my post."

192
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,342
Beep-boop! Selfie!

193
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,843
Right?

194
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,778
No one's... No one...

195
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:00,912
Okay, so the CEO

196
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:03,948
is a woman named Callie.

197
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,858
Great. Vámonos.

198
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,191
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

199
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,359
because I promised Prometheus I would,

200
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,295
and I would never break my word to him,

201
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:20,364
but for the record, I'm not a fan.

202
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,201
Of you, this big magic quest,
the whole... ing thing.

203
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,604
It's the reason Prometheus is dead.

204
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,105
So as far as I'm concerned,

205
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,207
you're a big part of why he's dead.

206
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:31,875
No, I... we don't...

207
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,710
Yeah, of course you don't.

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,744
You're humans.

209
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,813
Little human Magicians.

210
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:38,556
He loved you so.

211
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:42,327
All right, here it is.

212
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:47,957
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

213
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,759
To design a prison that secure

214
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,094
<i>for clients of that caliber...</i>

215
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,070
<i>When I explained that I would
need the most steadfast jailors,</i>

216
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,841
<i>Prometheus offered to help find them,</i>

217
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,843
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

218
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:11,078
<i>Always was good at quests.</i>

219
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,649
So you trapped some poor girl

220
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,751
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

221
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:18,853
She's there of her own will,

222
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:20,187
as was her father,

223
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:23,357
who offered himself
as, well, bait, really.

224
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:27,260
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

225
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,295
I gave them each an opportunity

226
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:32,799
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

227
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:33,967
I assure you,

228
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,435
she can leave if she wishes.

229
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:38,004
I wouldn't have it any other way.

230
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,139
Surely the quest has taught you,

231
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,616
sacrifice is part of everything.

232
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,445
Um, so when, uh, Prometheus

233
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,881
was looking to hide his back door...

234
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:51,425
I had already designed
the perfect place.

235
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,419
A place full of monsters

236
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,655
where no one wants to look.

237
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,623
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

238
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,293
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

239
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,495
who couldn't ensure it remained secure.

240
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,266
<i>He channeled every atom of power</i>

241
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,002
<i>into the keys.</i>

242
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,537
<i>So he, like, Horcruxed himself?</i>

243
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:14,771
<i>Jesus.</i>

244
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,440
<i>Someone got bit hard by the martyr bug.</i>

245
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,676
<i>All I can say is he believed in you.</i>

246
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,778
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

247
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,780
<i>when you would save us</i>

248
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,115
<i>if you had magic.</i>

249
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,482
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

250
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,684
<i>What... what does that mean?</i>

251
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,286
Guess we'll find out,

252
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,287
if you get to the end.

253
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,790
He gave everything for you,

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,492
<i>and then his enemies came,</i>

255
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,494
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

256
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,463
<i>With his power gone,</i>

257
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,465
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

258
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,134
<i>and they were strong.</i>

259
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:09,522
Sorry.

260
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,032
It was a long time ago.

261
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,661
So you don't suppose

262
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,529
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

263
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:20,500
and/or how to get in?

264
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,602
I've waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

265
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,343
Wait, this looks like...

266
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,279
is that Fillory?

267
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,114
It's upside-down.

268
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,416
Looked like that before
Ember and Umber got there,

269
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:40,085
when it was just a distant,
wild little world.

270
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,353
Oh, my God.

271
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,189
There's a...

272
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,291
a theory about Castle Whitespire,

273
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:47,558
that the dwarves based it on

274
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:48,626
the most perfect design

275
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:49,694
that they'd ever seen,

276
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:51,462
a castle called...

277
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,464
Blackspire, but Ember destroyed it.

278
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:55,400
More like flipped the whole thing over

279
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,201
and started over on the other side.

280
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:59,636
So my castle is based on your prison?

281
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:00,871
What can I say?

282
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,308
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

283
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,310
So Blackspire's still there,

284
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,145
it's just... underneath.

285
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,480
Yes.

286
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,575
Good luck with your quest.

287
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,208
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, lady, come on.

288
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,619
- How do we get in? The key paradox.
- Let me get one thing clear:

289
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,554
everything I put the girl through,

290
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:22,225
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

291
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,659
You'll find your way in,

292
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:27,263
and you'll find a way to do it safely
and securely, but whatever you do,

293
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,165
there's one simple thing

294
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:31,708
you need to understand
above everything else.

295
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:35,570
What's locked inside that castle...

296
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:41,176
Can never, ever be allowed to escape.

297
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:46,703
Begging pardon,

298
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:49,205
we need your official permission.

299
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,697
As acting High King.

300
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,268
You have my permission
to implement the new schedule.

301
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,637
Excellent, Your acting Majesty.

302
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,805
And if it's no trouble,

303
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,273
bring the tax collector's

304
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,608
latest expense reports.

305
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,311
I would like to double-check them.

306
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,945
Sorry.

307
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,415
Of course. Right away.

308
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,891
You need to stop apologizing.

309
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,326
You'd do well to remember,

310
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,295
that power comes from High King Margo,

311
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,498
but it flows through you.

312
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,299
Is there something you need?

313
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,600
Yes.

314
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,469
Six fairies have disappeared
in two days.

315
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,471
And how are you certain this is...

316
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,906
I found this.

317
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,808
I believe it's a part
of a magical device

318
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:44,854
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

319
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,782
There is no magic.

320
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,192
Someone's hunting my people.

321
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,667
What is this?

322
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,334
My lab,

323
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:09,969
where I come to think,

324
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,539
answer texts, create worlds.

325
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,674
Wait, do I get to create worlds?

326
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:16,509
I mean, we'll start with one.

327
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,344
You'll split your time between the lab

328
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,513
and answering the prayers
of your choice.

329
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:21,681
But I'll be blunt.

330
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:22,949
The work we do here

331
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,550
is much more vital to the big picture,

332
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,718
but we find that morale stays higher

333
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,853
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

334
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,692
One more thing.

335
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,694
My friends...

336
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,529
How come I can still feel them?

337
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:42,366
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

338
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,035
Q is stressing, and Fen...

339
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,538
I know that she wants to help
save these fairies' lives but...

340
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:49,474
This is the discipline.

341
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,509
You need to keep from being seduced.

342
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,412
You're wasted if you expend
too much energy

343
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:56,547
trying to look after every last fairy

344
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:57,748
when you could be building

345
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,516
and shaping worlds

346
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:01,918
where no fairy ever comes to harm.

347
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,320
Why don't I show you?

348
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,496
<i>So do we think the knight chick</i>

349
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:13,896
is somehow still in there?

350
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:16,398
It's god magic,

351
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:18,501
so anything's possible.

352
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:20,503
We really don't know
what could be in there.

353
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:21,604
I'll Travel in.

354
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:23,905
Excuse us for caring, but no.

355
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:26,509
We don't know what
you'd be blipping into,

356
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,544
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

357
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,745
from the last Penny.

358
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:31,514
Okay.

359
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:34,682
Say we do find some window.

360
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,084
We know this knight is gonna help us?

361
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:52,899
Hi.

362
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:53,967
You're asleep.

363
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,902
I'm in your head, not his.

364
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,606
It's a dream.

365
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:07,754
You have magic.

366
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,082
Had.

367
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,451
Uh, it's sort of a one-off.

368
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:15,120
- Listen...
- Ora.

369
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,622
I'm Quentin.

370
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:19,925
I need your help.

371
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,220
You're here about the fountain?
The back door to magic?

372
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,728
Yeah.

373
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:24,829
I can't help.

374
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:25,963
Uh, because you're

375
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,131
- guarding all the...
- No.

376
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,433
They're all gone.

377
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:31,969
He's the only one left.

378
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,472
Did they all die, or?

379
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:35,940
He killed them all.

380
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,610
You can't imagine what he's capable of.

381
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,144
That's why I can't do anything for you.

382
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:42,446
I cannot risk the security of my charge.

383
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:44,114
I get that.

384
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:46,983
I have something to offer you too.

385
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,423
Julia gave you a hit
of magic, and you did what?

386
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,957
Incepted the knight in the castle.

387
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:55,992
That magic was for killing a monster.

388
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:57,827
Why waste it on chatting with the help?

389
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:59,161
When Calypso told us that Ora

390
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,996
was there on her own accord,

391
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:03,799
I... I figured she must know
more than one way

392
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:05,501
in and out of the castle, and she does,

393
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:06,869
and she's going to open it for us.

394
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,003
In exchange for...

395
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,039
All you have to do is get in,

396
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:11,107
turn the key,

397
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,442
and get out fast.

398
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:14,843
Um, what about the monster?

399
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:18,714
- Ora will take care of the monster.
- What about you?

400
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:21,116
I stay in the castle.

401
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:24,786
It's a fair deal.

402
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,020
She's been there for centuries,

403
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,122
and she's tired,

404
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,958
and I'm... I'm strong enough,

405
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,459
thanks to the quest,

406
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:32,826
so I'm the new jailor.

407
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:35,195
- This isn't the solution.
- I second that.

408
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,164
Alice, who's the one that died for us?

409
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,701
You were willing to stay in Fillory

410
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,536
for forever. How is this different?

411
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,506
Someone has to step up.

412
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:48,208
Quick alternative pitch: take the
gun with the god-killing bullet

413
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:50,543
and shoot the... ing monster
in the face.

414
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:51,844
Second second that, yes.

415
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:52,912
No.

416
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,247
I promised, no clever stuff.

417
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,916
It's more bloody and straightforward.

418
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:59,919
Look, this monster,

419
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,187
it's not a joke.

420
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:04,591
We cannot let it escape, and the only
way to make sure that it doesn't

421
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:07,259
is to do this the hard way.

422
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:10,095
The quest taught us
that it's like that sometimes.

423
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,103
I don't like this.

424
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,705
Me neither,

425
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:21,039
but I'm going to do it.

426
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:32,315
Hello, love.

427
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:34,342
Oh, shit.

428
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:36,044
It's a human.

429
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:38,813
It's also the current ruler of Fillory.

430
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:39,881
Hello.

431
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,348
We've met,

432
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:42,650
so we can get right to the part

433
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,351
where I tell you to stop

434
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:45,920
stealing fairies to chop up.

435
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,022
They are full citizens of Fillory.

436
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:49,657
You will cease at once.

437
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,994
Full citizens. Well, la Di da.

438
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,831
- Escort them to the...
- Ah, ah, ah.

439
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,432
Know what a traveler is?

440
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:03,504
We can blip on out of here and go
about our beeswax anytime we please.

441
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:07,574
I have something you very much need

442
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,617
in the castle.

443
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,584
They won't be but a moment.

444
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:20,019
And may I say, sir,

445
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,922
how much I admire your suit.

446
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,723
I've been passing bunnies with Margo.

447
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:27,026
They are very close
to turning magic back on.

448
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,727
Hooray for them.

449
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,394
And you must know

450
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,896
the reason Irene is poaching fairies

451
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,631
is she needs a huge amount of energy

452
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:36,868
to power a... a thing
that must be placed

453
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,103
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

454
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,638
Let me save your breath.

455
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,707
I don't care.

456
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,475
You should.

457
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:47,778
If we keep her long enough, we can
stop her from derailing magic

458
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,446
and taking it for herself

459
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,814
and for the Library.

460
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,382
This is the future we're talking about.

461
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,750
Not our future.

462
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I cannot risk another soul.

463
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,992
I know exactly how to deal with this.

464
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,627
<i>So, what are you offering, exactly?</i>

465
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,462
I broke a deal.

466
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,931
It's my fault we're vulnerable.

467
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,469
I offer you the magic of 50 fairies

468
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,971
with a single body.

469
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:20,576
You know the power of royal marrow.

470
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,611
You're volunteering to die?

471
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,146
In exchange for a new agreement.

472
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:27,816
- Wait.
- No fairy will be hunted

473
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,152
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

474
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:33,822
and this deal cannot be broken,

475
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,956
for any reason,

476
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,826
by any being, ever.

477
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,494
Swear to that,

478
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:41,937
and you have me.

479
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:45,766
Time is of the essence.

480
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:48,836
My offer expires in one minute.

481
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:52,506
<i>I'm gonna need a table</i>

482
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:53,641
with restraints,

483
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:57,023
uh, a bone saw, knives, and a grinder.

484
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,983
There must be another way.

485
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,985
The deal I struck with Irene

486
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,787
will finally make it possible

487
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:10,456
for my people to be safe and free.

488
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,528
Tears for your enemy?

489
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,079
<i>Any day now.</i>

490
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:36,580
<i>My God.</i>

491
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,216
Where did it turn out to be? Alice?

492
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,218
This Castle at the End of the World?

493
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,721
Fillory. Underneath.

494
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:46,022
Castle Blackspire.

495
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,591
- How did you...
- I was a fan, too, once.

496
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:54,497
I need a favor.

497
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,666
I have this,

498
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:57,701
and I know it's wrong,

499
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:58,868
and I'll never use it again,

500
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,904
but I need it.

501
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:02,172
To?

502
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:04,206
I hear you have an experimental potion

503
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:07,076
that not only wipes your memory,

504
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,511
but creates a whole new persona.

505
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:12,214
I do, but what?

506
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,683
I'll always be tempted.

507
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:18,053
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

508
00:22:18,063 --> 00:22:20,588
unless I have no memory.

509
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,957
Alice,

510
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,793
you are...

511
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,597
you are one of the most
brilliant Magicians

512
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:30,865
I've ever seen.

513
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,769
I didn't choose to be!

514
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,871
I want to live my life,

515
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,773
not how my parents raised me to think,

516
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,108
or what you taught me,

517
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:42,809
or what the Library wants me to do.

518
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,045
I'm not sure if that's
the best path to happiness.

519
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:46,880
What if there is no best path?

520
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,950
I don't know.

521
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,286
All I know is the one I'm on
is a bad one...

522
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,223
And I'm stepping off.

523
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,979
Once you've...

524
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:22,180
Yes?

525
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,648
Drink this.

526
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:25,616
Give it about a full day

527
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:28,085
for everything to get rebooted.

528
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:30,754
After that,

529
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:32,156
you are on your own.

530
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,632
Thank you.

531
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:53,943
So?

532
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:55,878
We need to talk

533
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:57,346
about our arrangement.

534
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,440
You tell anyone else?

535
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,502
Please don't.

536
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:25,070
Of course not.

537
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,675
You're the only one that I...

538
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,343
wanted... had to tell.

539
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:38,650
Look, I know that I don't show it

540
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,784
or act like it all the time,

541
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:41,619
but...

542
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:44,322
but you're...

543
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:47,292
you're the one that I love, Q.

544
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:48,625
You're the one.

545
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:53,564
And the only thing I'm going to
regret is not remembering that.

546
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,776
Well...

547
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:01,332
Well, I'll remember for the both of us.

548
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,376
You made a deal you will regret.

549
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:42,028
You'll never know.

550
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:45,858
True.

551
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,460
But I'll die a queen,

552
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,571
not some mediocre, power-hungry girl.

553
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,780
As I said, I'm only alive
because I fulfill its need.

554
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,514
To be entertained.

555
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:22,615
Served, coddled.

556
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,117
Loved.

557
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:26,820
Loved, like...

558
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,222
A child.

559
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,979
Okay, that's better
than my first thought.

560
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,716
Right now, he thinks
we're playing a game.

561
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:33,730
Hide and seek.

562
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:35,915
It's the only way to ensure
he'd stay diverted long enough

563
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:38,258
to let you in, and right
now, he's getting bored.

564
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:44,970
What's up?

565
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:49,141
In case I get held up.

566
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:50,176
Don't.

567
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:52,144
Hear me?

568
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,148
You got this, okay?

569
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,989
My love?

570
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,225
I found you! I tag you!

571
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:11,730
Give it a moment.

572
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,832
Does it have a name?

573
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,666
No.

574
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:21,605
What makes it so dangerous?

575
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:24,007
The gods created something
that simply...

576
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:25,575
wants.

577
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,044
So it has to know one secure place

578
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:28,178
and constant love.

579
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:29,346
If not,

580
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:30,780
if its appetite goes unfed

581
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,049
and it's unleashed,

582
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,951
even the gods can't stop it.

583
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:40,056
Love?

584
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,290
Come out!

585
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,059
Did you fall asleep?

586
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,361
Yeah, but what can it do?

587
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,158
Will you play with me?

588
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:24,998
Eliot! No!

589
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,842
- Fuck, Eliot...
- How?

590
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:38,576
God-killing bullet.

591
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:40,631
This is not what we agreed on.

592
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:42,709
I didn't actually agree on anything,

593
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,739
but I did decide that
one of my best friends

594
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,342
wouldn't spend the rest of
his life locked in a prison,

595
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:49,779
guarding what turns out to be a
really not-so-scary monster.

596
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:53,783
Wait, where'd she go?

597
00:29:57,697 --> 00:30:00,421
Anyway, it's done.

598
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,924
You spent a little bit
too much time as a king.

599
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,793
Well, that's really not
the issue now, is it?

600
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,864
Could've used some Goo
Gone and a toothbrush,

601
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,659
- but I think we're good to go.
- All right, let's go.

602
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,801
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- All right bitches,

603
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,238
everyone grab a key.

604
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,274
Alice, what are you doing?

605
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:22,977
Nothing good.

606
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,445
- No!
- Margo!

607
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:31,051
She's destroying the keys!

608
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:32,119
I have to.

609
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,888
You don't get to decide that the
whole universe doesn't have magic.

610
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:36,188
I'll never remember this.

611
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,232
Alice...

612
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:48,067
why?

613
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:50,035
You...

614
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:53,171
you talked me out of
working for the Library.

615
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:56,742
I realize there's no good side.

616
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:59,511
Magic just makes people
different shades of bad,

617
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,347
selfish and irresponsible.

618
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:03,481
We can't handle it!

619
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,017
You can't handle it.

620
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:06,751
It's wrong.

621
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:08,352
We're wrong.

622
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:10,317
And it stops now!

623
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:22,900
What are you doing?

624
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,100
I'm gonna cut the bitch,

625
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,610
grab her fairy coke
power-up, and fix this.

626
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:30,974
<i>So, where shall we start?</i>

627
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:32,341
Ocean?

628
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,243
Cute little landmass?

629
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:35,411
Dealer's choice.

630
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,950
I know you can still feel them.

631
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,117
You need to let them go.

632
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:43,886
I know, but it's bad.

633
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,888
In a blink, it'll be good again,

634
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:48,057
and in two blinks, they'll be long gone.

635
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:52,294
<i>He's on the floor. He's...</i>

636
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:54,229
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

637
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,565
<i>He'll die, not giving up.</i>

638
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:58,399
Can't you feel his heart?

639
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:01,569
<i>No,</i>

640
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:03,104
<i>'cause I don't do what you're doing.</i>

641
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,977
You need to let them go.

642
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:11,145
Remember the future we're creating.

643
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:21,922
Will you play with me?

644
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:26,827
- Hey!
- Ah!

645
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:28,061
You think you can cast

646
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,295
faster than I can stab? Go!

647
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:32,164
- Please, listen to me. The knight...
- Ah, shut the... up and...

648
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,155
- Fix this.
- Now.

649
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:42,407
There's no point.

650
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:44,910
The magic's gone. It's done.

651
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,582
He's right.

652
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:54,953
Jules.

653
00:32:54,963 --> 00:32:59,024
None of your pain
is what we'd call quiet,

654
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,464
especially yours.

655
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:05,060
I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

656
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,710
You'll see someday,

657
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:09,845
it wasn't.

658
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:13,076
For now,

659
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,945
I need you to stay out of the way.

660
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:31,267
I want you to know, it's your bravery...

661
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,237
made me see.

662
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:34,806
See what?

663
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,575
What I need to do.

664
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,416
What are you doing?

665
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,511
What Prometheus did.

666
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:47,845
Whore-crotching.

667
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:49,847
- Horcruxing.
- Oh.

668
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:51,683
- Look, Jules, are you sure?
- Shh.

669
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,884
Julia, you could lose your power.

670
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:51,938
- Hurry.
- You okay?

671
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:58,512
Okay, okay.

672
00:34:58,522 --> 00:34:59,946
Hey, I got you. I got you.

673
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:01,915
Come on.

674
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,284
Are you okay?

675
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:05,985
It hurt.

676
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:08,962
And I'm not con...
connected to anything anymore.

677
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,659
- I got you.
- Are you guys ready?

678
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:17,104
Let's do this.

679
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,341
Dean Fogg?

680
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,313
Travel, Penny,

681
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:11,981
I kill them all.

682
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:53,887
Irene...

683
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:55,856
We do have a deal.

684
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:58,892
Unless you want to have
a problem with the Library.

685
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:18,071
<i>The very essence is altered</i>

686
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:21,614
by the slightest deviation in
finger position. Watch closely.

687
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:28,247
The difference is in the position
of the right middle finger.

688
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:34,639
Sorry, looks like we're
having another...

689
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:37,375
power issue.

690
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:41,278
The rations are wholly inadequate.
I can't even assign homework!

691
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,099
Do the best you can.

692
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,317
I'll attempt to renegotiate
for our supply.

693
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:47,838
How?

694
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,207
I'm afraid we can't revisit
your supply until next quarter.

695
00:37:52,217 --> 00:37:54,176
I've spoken to the Board.

696
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:56,512
- Which Board?
- North American Fourth District.

697
00:37:56,522 --> 00:38:00,115
Calgary enrollment hasn't
bounced back the way we have.

698
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,050
They're barely using
2/3 of their allotment,

699
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,286
and they've offered it to us.

700
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:07,163
Both you and they need
to bring a written request to...

701
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:12,168
In triplicate.

702
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:17,532
You'll have a decision by the 31st.

703
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,033
Excellent.

704
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,469
There's just one more request.

705
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,570
My answer hasn't changed.

706
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,572
She made a deal with us, then broke it.

707
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:27,040
Unlike the others,

708
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,050
she belongs to the Library.

709
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,087
I just would like to see her.

710
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:38,092
Please.

711
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,096
Where are they?

712
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,258
Per the... deal,

713
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:48,093
as struck with the Order,

714
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:49,595
safe.

715
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:52,331
No, no, no, no, no, they're not.

716
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:55,934
Alice, the McAllistairs can't find them,

717
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:57,602
and if they try,

718
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:59,437
the Library's retribution will be swift.

719
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:01,105
Not the McAllistairs!

720
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,273
That thing!

721
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:05,943
It can jump bodies, I told you.
You should know,

722
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:08,757
that alone is a very dangerous ability.

723
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:11,145
If they don't know who they
are, if they don't have magic,

724
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,417
they can't protect themselves.

725
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:14,015
Okay.

726
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,619
Hypothetically,

727
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:18,413
this thing gets loose.

728
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,398
Why would it go after them?

729
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:24,961
It's seen them.

730
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:28,198
It knows magic is back.

731
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,242
It knows they're Magicians,
even if they don't.

732
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:42,945
Sophie, hit pause
on your idiocy for a sec.

733
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:44,280
Janet?

734
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,423
Hi, I'm Isaac.

735
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:56,558
You're late. Me, too.

736
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,661
Uh, luckily, I don't recognize
the legality of red lights.

737
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:13,063
Quentin.

738
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,197
I found you.

739
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:17,400
no, sorry, I'm Brian.

740
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:21,070
Do a card trick for me, Quentin.

741
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:25,350
Come on.

742
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:29,746
Will you play with me?

743
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:31,647
I'm sorry, I think you've got me

744
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:34,090
mistaken for somebody else,
but I... you know...

745
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:36,752
<i>I saw it.</i>

746
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,320
<i>I've felt it!</i>

747
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,422
Even the gods are afraid of it.

748
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,493
This is your fault,
just as much as it is mine.

749
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,294
Get me out of here!

750
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,165
Help me stop it.

751
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:09,148
Don't be scared.

752
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:10,751
This is great!

753
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,787
There's so much for us to do together.

754
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,490
I can't wait to get started

755
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,527
on all the people
who really deserve our wrath.

756
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:23,629
Um, no, look, please, I'm not... I...

757
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,098
This is gonna be so fun.

758
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:29,368
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.
