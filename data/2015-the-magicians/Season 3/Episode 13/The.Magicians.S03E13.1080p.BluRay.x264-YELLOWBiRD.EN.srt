00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,709
<i>Previously on</i>
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:06,232
I'll send you
on an epic quest.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,889
Q, I think this is it.

4
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:09,506
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

5
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:11,856
Okay, if fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,974
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

7
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:15,252
that I met back in Athens
one time.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,020
You mean Prometheus? 
He's dead.

9
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,130
Damn it!

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,232
He told me
this crazy story one time

11
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:22,986
about how there was, like,
a secret back door

12
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:24,280
to magic.

13
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,411
<i>I have...</i>

14
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:26,673
<i>magic.</i>

15
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,766
I have to be able
to do something with it.

16
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:30,697
I planted a seed
for you to grow.

17
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,813
<i>It doesn't matter
where it comes from.</i>

18
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,064
<i>It matters what you do
with it.</i>

19
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:49,048
<i>"The Tale
of the Seven Keys,"</i>

20
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:51,618
<i>chapter eight.</i>

21
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,197
<i>The Knight remained imprisoned</i>

22
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,230
<i>at the Castle
at the End of the World.</i>

23
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:00,403
<i>Not even a warrior
as great as he</i>

24
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,850
<i>could break the bonds
placed on him</i>

25
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,275
<i>by the Witch.</i>

26
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:04,939
<i>He could not escape.</i>

27
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,690
<i>But his daughter,
now every bit</i>

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:08,893
<i>the knight her father was,</i>

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,851
<i>and more so,
never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:14,330
<i>She fought monsters,
real and imagined,</i>

31
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,587
<i>without as well as within.</i>

32
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,859
<i>She had won all seven keys,</i>

33
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,510
<i>and now she set sail</i>

34
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:22,117
<i>for the Castle at
the End of the World.</i>

35
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,469
Okay, tick-tock.

36
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:24,952
Does it say where
the castle is?

37
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,693
Shh, Bambi.
Let him read.

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,347
Just saying, andale.

39
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:32,353
Okay, so she faces the door
of the castle.

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,354
In the door,
there were seven keyholes.

41
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,835
The door swallowed
the keys whole

42
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:39,493
and slowly opened.

43
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,861
Up ahead, she saw her father,
bound by seven chains.

44
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,939
"Father," she cried,
"I'm here to save you."

45
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,319
<i>She placed the keys
into the locks,</i>

46
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,560
<i>and when she turned
the seventh...</i>

47
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:49,704
Sorry, time out.

48
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,487
I thought the weird door

49
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:52,637
swallowed the keys.

50
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:56,041
Yeah, no, it did, but then...
she has done again.

51
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,677
I'm not that drunk.

52
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,465
This is sloppy plotting.

53
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,768
Or it's a paradox.

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,295
- Hmm.
- That's a clue.

55
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:04,771
Oh, we're fucked.

56
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,901
The fucking Library

57
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:07,081
is ready to swoop in

58
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,301
with a...
What's it called?

59
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,907
Siphon,
and it's not that simple.

60
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,563
Takes a lot of power
to charge it,

61
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,761
and they don't have those kind
of reserves just lying around,

62
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:18,350
thanks to Julia
freeing those fairies.

63
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,834
Yeah, well, it's the Library.
They'll think of something.

64
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,572
All we gotta do
is beat them to it.

65
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,150
I mean,
their window of time

66
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,587
to even use the, uh,
whatchamacallit

67
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,838
is super short, right?

68
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,887
Less than a minute,
once we turn the key.

69
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:32,106
There you go.
Get all this done before...

70
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,891
Our Lady of the Tree,
help us.

71
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:36,166
Please, help me!

72
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:39,072
Hi, Julia.

73
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:40,724
Pleasure to finally meet you.

74
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,896
I'm Iris,
messenger goddess,

75
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:45,314
bon vivant, rainbow aficionado.

76
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:46,944
Let's chat.

77
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:48,685
Who's...

78
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:50,560
Our Lady of the Tree?

79
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:51,949
You are.

80
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,516
I presume they mean

81
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:55,434
the trees you brought back
in Fillory.

82
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:58,275
Lovely act of penance.
Good moniker for you.

83
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,758
Just what are you saying?

84
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:04,356
You fulfilled the task
Our Lady Underground gave you...

85
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:06,006
To grow the spark...

86
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:07,794
And now you are the flame.

87
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,488
So I'm...

88
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,158
A full-on goddess, correct.

89
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,754
Holy shit.

90
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,521
We have a lot of work

91
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,403
to do, love,
all very exciting.

92
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,503
I'm sort of
in the middle of this quest.

93
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,669
Oh, that.
They can take it from here.

94
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,286
Your concerns
are greater now.

95
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,740
Your duty to them is over.

96
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:32,238
And by the way,
so is all that pain.

97
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:34,267
You can put it down.

98
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:36,453
Okay.

99
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,052
I mean, should I, like, bow?

100
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:39,927
No.
I mean, I'm still me.

101
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:41,647
Well, you're clearly not.

102
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:43,280
I mean, it's been kind of hard

103
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,831
to ignore
the nuclear power plant

104
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:48,385
radiating off you
the last couple weeks.

105
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:49,823
I don't know, just...

106
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,202
wanted us to finish this
together, you know?

107
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,378
Mm, me too, but...

108
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,578
I mean, let's be honest, like,

109
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,095
you deserve this.

110
00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:00,266
Why me?

111
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,097
Life is unfair,

112
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,434
but I'm good with it
occasionally working out

113
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:06,886
for people that I actually love.

114
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,573
Our Lady of the Tree.

115
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,323
No, it's good.

116
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,871
Yeah, it's good.

117
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,039
It's formal.

118
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,222
Very formal.

119
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,822
I'm gonna miss you too.

120
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,180
What was that?

121
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,349
It's enough juice for a one-off spell.

122
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:44,930
You know, just in case, like,

123
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:48,401
a giant "Indiana Jones" boulder
comes hurtling at you.

124
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,217
You can fight it off.

125
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,972
I love you, Jules.

126
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,627
I love you too.

127
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:08,261
Goodbye, Quentin.

128
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,495
Any headway?

129
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,281
Well, wasted a few hours

130
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,886
looking at castles, but...

131
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,884
think I'm onto something,

132
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,385
or someone,

133
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:44,870
who could help us.

134
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,874
I've been tripping on this, hard.

135
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:51,293
It's the witch, in the castle,
sitting at a table,

136
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,849
on which another, smaller, castle...

137
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,898
- Yeah?
- Well, either this is some.

138
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:58,700
M.C. Escher, "the castle
goes on forever" shit,

139
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:00,878
or that picture means something.

140
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,706
Do you see these?

141
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,393
These are drafting tools

142
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,034
for architects.

143
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,759
Right, she's the architect that...

144
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,833
that Reynard talked about,
that she's... oh, my God,

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,802
she's the one that, uh...
she made the prison

146
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,150
for the mistakes of the gods,

147
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,649
and she... she hid it.

148
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:21,097
She knows where it is.

149
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:23,948
We need to find her, Q.

150
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:28,227
There are, like, 50 minor gods
of architecture and the arts.

151
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,573
Well, come at me. Let's
get 'em all down here.

152
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,185
I mean, full-on goddess, huh?

153
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,887
Look, I mean, I get that

154
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,335
Julia has been through some shit,

155
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,691
but seriously, it just seems random.

156
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,794
So it's like life, then?

157
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:43,761
I don't know. I'm happy for her.

158
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,996
Me too. Might as well be.

159
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:49,043
Well, I'd be happier if she
stayed, so she could help us.

160
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,010
Look, she seemed pretty positive that
we could do this without her, so...

161
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,651
You forgot Calypso.

162
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,194
Like the musical style?

163
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,464
The witch that imprisoned Odysseus.

164
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:00,978
And I love you, El, but how
the hell did you pass AP Lit

165
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,081
- without ever reading?
- I didn't.

166
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,929
So, according to the story,

167
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:06,636
she was a nymph, which...

168
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:09,533
not a god, but I assume
a pretty powerful creature,

169
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,855
considering she had him in lockdown

170
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,537
for, like, seven full years

171
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:15,271
on an island called Ogai...

172
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,493
Ogiji?

173
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,495
- Ogijia?
- Ogygia.

174
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:19,810
However that's pronounced.

175
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:20,931
Cool. Great.

176
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:22,379
So do we book tickets?

177
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,733
No, it's not...

178
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,882
it's not a real place.

179
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,281
Hold on, okay, so...

180
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:27,870
Ogai... ogaiga,

181
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,084
or however you say it,

182
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,405
is a island

183
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,488
um, in the fictional tale
of "The Odyssey."

184
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,222
It's a clothing label,

185
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,706
a Eurovision band,

186
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,428
a tech company... they make games.

187
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:40,573
Oh, my God.

188
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,951
I know them. I worship them.

189
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,099
They're the Candy Collider people.

190
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:48,055
I nearly spent $600 on level 593.

191
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,457
It took me 12 straight days.

192
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,439
There are prisons, and
there are prisons.

193
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:52,894
Right?

194
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:55,844
We're all just 24/7, "Like my post."

195
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:57,612
Beep-boop! Selfie!

196
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:59,066
Right?

197
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:01,001
No one's... No one...

198
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,182
Okay, so the CEO

199
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:05,218
is a woman named Callie.

200
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:07,089
Great. Vámonos.

201
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,414
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

202
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,582
because I promised Prometheus I would,

203
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,565
and I would never break my word to him,

204
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:21,587
but for the record, I'm not a fan.

205
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:25,424
Of you, this big magic quest,
the whole fucking thing.

206
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,827
It's the reason Prometheus is dead.

207
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:29,375
So as far as I'm concerned,

208
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:31,477
you're a big part of why he's dead.

209
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:33,098
No, I... we don't...

210
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,754
Yeah, of course you don't.

211
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:36,014
You're humans.

212
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:38,083
Little human Magicians.

213
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,976
He loved you so.

214
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,747
All right, here it is.

215
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:49,227
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

216
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,982
To design a prison that secure

217
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:54,514
<i>for clients of that caliber...</i>

218
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:03,340
<i>When I explained that I would
need the most steadfast jailors,</i>

219
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:07,111
<i>Prometheus offered to help find them,</i>

220
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:10,066
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

221
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,498
<i>Always was good at quests.</i>

222
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,872
So you trapped some poor girl

223
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,021
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

224
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,076
She's there of her own will,

225
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,457
as was her father,

226
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:24,580
who offered himself
as, well, bait, really.

227
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,483
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

228
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,565
I gave them each an opportunity

229
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,837
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

230
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:35,190
I assure you,

231
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:36,705
she can leave if she wishes.

232
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,821
I wouldn't have it any other way.

233
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,409
Surely the quest has taught you,

234
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:44,036
sacrifice is part of everything.

235
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:47,922
Um, so when, uh, Prometheus

236
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,151
was looking to hide his back door...

237
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:52,845
I had already designed
the perfect place.

238
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:55,453
A place full of monsters

239
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,671
where no one wants to look.

240
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,650
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

241
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,235
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

242
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,569
who couldn't ensure it remained secure.

243
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:10,223
<i>He channeled every atom of power</i>

244
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,894
<i>into the keys.</i>

245
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:14,458
<i>So he, like, Horcruxed himself?</i>

246
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:15,806
<i>Jesus.</i>

247
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,056
<i>Someone got bit hard by the martyr bug.</i>

248
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,321
<i>All I can say is he believed in you.</i>

249
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,797
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

250
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,734
<i>when you would save us</i>

251
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,038
<i>if you had magic.</i>

252
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,405
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

253
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:28,654
<i>What... what does that mean?</i>

254
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,209
Guess we'll find out,

255
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,257
if you get to the end.

256
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,760
He gave everything for you,

257
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,415
<i>and then his enemies came,</i>

258
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:40,417
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

259
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,386
<i>With his power gone,</i>

260
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,388
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

261
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,254
<i>and they were strong.</i>

262
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,445
Sorry.

263
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:12,152
It was a long time ago.

264
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:15,584
So you don't suppose

265
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:17,499
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

266
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:21,423
and/or how to get in?

267
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,722
I've waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

268
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,313
Wait, this looks like...

269
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,202
is that Fillory?

270
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,037
It's upside-down.

271
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,386
Looked like that before
Ember and Umber got there,

272
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:41,055
when it was just a distant,
wild little world.

273
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:43,276
Oh, my God.

274
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,112
There's a...

275
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,214
a theory about Castle Whitespire,

276
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:48,528
that the dwarves based it on

277
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:49,721
the most perfect design

278
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,858
that they'd ever seen,

279
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,385
a castle called...

280
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,387
Blackspire, but Ember destroyed it.

281
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:56,370
More like flipped the whole thing over

282
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:58,171
and started over on the other side.

283
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:00,606
So my castle is based on your prison?

284
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:01,794
What can I say?

285
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:05,278
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

286
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:07,280
So Blackspire's still there,

287
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,115
it's just... underneath.

288
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:11,013
Yes.

289
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,499
Good luck with your quest.

290
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:14,343
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, lady, come on.

291
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,365
- How do we get in? The key paradox.
- Let me get one thing clear:

292
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,524
everything I put the girl through,

293
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:22,943
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

294
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,424
You'll find your way in,

295
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,057
and you'll find a way to do it safely
and securely, but whatever you do,

296
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,088
there's one simple thing

297
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,828
you need to understand
above everything else.

298
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,690
What's locked inside that castle...

299
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:42,303
Can never, ever be allowed to escape.

300
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,507
Begging pardon,

301
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:52,313
we need your official permission.

302
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,633
As acting High King.

303
00:12:55,786 --> 00:13:00,054
Oh, you have my permission
to implement the new schedule.

304
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,376
Excellent, Your acting Majesty.

305
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:04,591
And if it's no trouble,

306
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:06,059
bring the tax collector's

307
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,394
latest expense reports.

308
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,097
I would like to double-check them.

309
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:11,684
Sorry.

310
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,351
Of course. Right away.

311
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,630
You need to stop apologizing.

312
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,112
You'd do well to remember,

313
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,081
that power comes from High King Margo,

314
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,237
but it flows through you.

315
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:33,085
Is there something you need?

316
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:34,339
Yes.

317
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:37,208
Six fairies have disappeared
in two days.

318
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,257
And how are you certain this is...

319
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,645
I found this.

320
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:43,594
I believe it's a part
of a magical device

321
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:47,790
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

322
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,568
There is no magic.

323
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,128
Someone's hunting my people.

324
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,453
What is this?

325
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,073
My lab,

326
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,755
where I come to think,

327
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:15,278
answer texts, create worlds.

328
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:17,413
Wait, do I get to create worlds?

329
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,248
I mean, we'll start with one.

330
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:21,130
You'll split your time between the lab

331
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,299
and answering the prayers
of your choice.

332
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:24,467
But I'll be blunt.

333
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:25,688
The work we do here

334
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,336
is much more vital to the big picture,

335
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,457
but we find that morale stays higher

336
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:31,789
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

337
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,478
One more thing.

338
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:38,433
My friends...

339
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,465
How come I can still feel them?

340
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,152
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

341
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,774
Q is stressing, and Fen...

342
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,324
I know that she wants to help
save these fairies' lives but...

343
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,213
This is the discipline.

344
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,295
You need to keep from being seduced.

345
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:57,151
You're wasted if you expend
too much energy

346
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:59,286
trying to look after every last fairy

347
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:00,534
when you could be building

348
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,255
and shaping worlds

349
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,704
where no fairy ever comes to harm.

350
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,256
Why don't I show you?

351
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,235
<i>So do we think the knight chick</i>

352
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:16,682
is somehow still in there?

353
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,137
It's god magic,

354
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,240
so anything's possible.

355
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,289
We really don't know
what could be in there.

356
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:24,390
I'll Travel in.

357
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:26,644
Excuse us for caring, but no.

358
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:29,248
We don't know what
you'd be blipping into,

359
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:31,330
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

360
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,531
from the last Penny.

361
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:34,253
Okay.

362
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,421
Say we do find some window.

363
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:40,020
We know this knight is gonna help us?

364
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,528
Hi.

365
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:56,807
You're asleep.

366
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,838
I'm in your head, not his.

367
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:02,542
It's a dream.

368
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,237
You have magic.

369
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:12,821
Had.

370
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,219
Uh, it's sort of a one-off.

371
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,859
- Listen...
- Ora.

372
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:19,831
I'm Quentin.

373
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:22,731
I need your help.

374
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,007
You're here about the fountain?
The back door to magic?

375
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:26,467
Yeah.

376
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,848
I can't help.

377
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,041
Uh, because you're

378
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,238
- guarding all the...
- No.

379
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,720
They're all gone.

380
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:34,755
He's the only one left.

381
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:37,036
Did they all die, or?

382
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:38,679
He killed them all.

383
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:41,349
You can't imagine what he's capable of.

384
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,140
That's why I can't do anything for you.

385
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,383
I cannot risk the security of my charge.

386
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,871
I get that.

387
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,919
I have something to offer you too.

388
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,162
Julia gave you a hit
of magic, and you did what?

389
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,743
Incepted the knight in the castle.

390
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,731
That magic was for killing a monster.

391
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,566
Why waste it on chatting with the help?

392
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,947
When Calypso told us that Ora

393
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,735
was there on her own accord,

394
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,538
I... I figured she must know
more than one way

395
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,240
in and out of the castle, and she does,

396
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,674
and she's going to open it for us.

397
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:10,789
In exchange for...

398
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,825
All you have to do is get in,

399
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:13,893
turn the key,

400
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,228
and get out fast.

401
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,582
Um, what about the monster?

402
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,848
- Ora will take care of the monster.
- What about you?

403
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:24,255
I stay in the castle.

404
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,525
It's a fair deal.

405
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:28,975
She's been there for centuries,

406
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:32,403
and she's tired,
and I'm... I'm strong enough,

407
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,198
thanks to the quest,

408
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,565
so I'm the new jailor.

409
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:38,241
- This isn't the solution.
- I second that.

410
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,389
Alice, who's the one that died for us?

411
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,690
You were willing to stay in Fillory

412
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:45,659
for forever. How is this different?

413
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:48,245
Someone has to step up.

414
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:50,994
Quick alternative pitch: take the
gun with the god-killing bullet

415
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:53,282
and shoot the... ing monster
in the face.

416
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,576
Second second that, yes.

417
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,195
No.
I-I promised, no clever stuff.

418
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,702
It's more bloody and straightforward.

419
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,216
Look, this monster,

420
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:03,926
it's not a joke.

421
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:07,377
We cannot let it escape, and the only
way to make sure that it doesn't

422
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,278
is to do this the hard way.

423
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,934
The quest taught us
that it's like that sometimes.

424
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,653
I don't like this.

425
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,444
Me neither,

426
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:23,975
but I'm going to do it.

427
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,103
Hello, love.

428
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:38,949
Oh, shit.

429
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,650
It's a human.

430
00:18:41,044 --> 00:18:43,460
It's also the current ruler of Fillory.

431
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,008
Hello.

432
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,057
We've met,

433
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,541
so we can get right to the part

434
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,174
where I tell you to stop

435
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,954
stealing fairies to chop up.

436
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:53,118
They are full citizens of Fillory.

437
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,753
You will cease at once.

438
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,446
Full citizens. Well, la Di da.

439
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:02,927
- Escort them to the...
- Ah, ah, ah.

440
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:04,481
Know what a traveler is?

441
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:08,750
We can blip on out of here and go
about our beeswax anytime we please.

442
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,670
I have something you very much need

443
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,863
in the castle.

444
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,633
They won't be but a moment.

445
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,115
And may I say, sir,

446
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,971
how much I admire your suit.

447
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,618
I've been passing bunnies with Margo.

448
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:32,122
They are very close
to turning magic back on.

449
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,776
Hooray for them.

450
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:35,443
And you must know

451
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,992
the reason Irene is poaching fairies

452
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,727
is she needs a huge amount of energy

453
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,917
to power a... a thing
that must be placed

454
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,199
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

455
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:45,734
Let me save your breath.

456
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,803
I don't care.

457
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,524
You should.

458
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:52,874
If we keep her long enough, we can
stop her from derailing magic

459
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,329
and taking it for herself

460
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:55,580
and for the Library.

461
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,571
This is the future we're talking about.

462
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,758
Not our future.

463
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,808
I cannot risk another soul.

464
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:06,843
I know exactly how to deal with this.

465
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,525
<i>So, what are you offering, exactly?</i>

466
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:11,313
I broke a deal.

467
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,979
It's my fault we're vulnerable.

468
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,320
I offer you the magic of 50 fairies

469
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,300
with a single body.

470
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:24,828
You know the power of royal marrow.

471
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:27,641
You're volunteering to die?

472
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:30,044
In exchange for a new agreement.

473
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:32,714
- Wait.
- No fairy will be hunted

474
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:36,003
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

475
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,977
and this deal cannot be broken,

476
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,212
for any reason,

477
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,203
by any being, ever.

478
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,118
Swear to that,

479
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,102
and you have me.

480
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,617
Time is of the essence.

481
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:53,884
My offer expires in one minute.

482
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,404
<i>I'm gonna need a table</i>

483
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:58,539
with restraints,

484
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:01,235
uh, a bone saw, knives, and a grinder.

485
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,834
There must be another way.

486
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:10,836
The deal I struck with Irene

487
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,685
will finally make it possible

488
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,625
for my people to be safe and free.

489
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,576
Tears for your enemy?

490
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:39,977
<i>Any day now.</i>

491
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,431
<i>My God.</i>

492
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,067
Where did it turn out to be? Alice?

493
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:46,460
This Castle at the End of the World?

494
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,938
Fillory. Underneath.

495
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,873
Castle Blackspire.

496
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,639
- How did you...
- I was a fan, too, once.

497
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:59,348
I need a favor.

498
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:01,517
I have this,

499
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,697
and I know it's wrong,

500
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:05,101
and I'll never use it again,
but I need it.

501
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,201
To?

502
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,104
I hear you have an experimental potion

503
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:11,942
that not only wipes your memory,

504
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:14,409
but creates a whole new persona.

505
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:17,065
I do, but what?

506
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,534
I'll always be tempted.

507
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,951
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

508
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:25,486
unless I have no memory.

509
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:27,808
Alice,

510
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:30,644
you are...

511
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:34,634
you are one of the most
brilliant Magicians

512
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:35,931
I've ever seen.

513
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,523
I didn't choose to be!

514
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:42,250
I want to live my life,

515
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:44,671
not how my parents raised me to think,

516
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:45,959
or what you taught me,

517
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:47,660
or what the Library wants me to do.

518
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,943
I'm not sure if that's
the best path to happiness.

519
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,928
What if there is no best path?

520
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,403
I don't know.

521
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:58,898
All I know is the one I'm on
is a bad one...

522
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:02,396
And I'm stepping off.

523
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:25,895
Once you've...

524
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:27,031
Yes?

525
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:28,499
Drink this.

526
00:23:28,586 --> 00:23:30,467
Give it about a full day

527
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,983
for everything to get rebooted.

528
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,605
After that,

529
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:37,204
you are on your own.

530
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:47,560
Thank you.

531
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,794
So?

532
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,729
We need to talk

533
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,394
about our arrangement.

534
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:27,908
You tell anyone else?

535
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,812
Please don't.

536
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,905
Of course not.

537
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,492
You're the only one that I...

538
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,803
wanted... had to tell.

539
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,589
Look, I know that I don't show it

540
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:47,705
or act like it all the time,

541
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:48,911
but...

542
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:51,585
but you're...

543
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,212
you're the one that I love, Q.

544
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,447
You're the one.

545
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,386
And the only thing I'm going to
regret is not remembering that.

546
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,189
Well...

547
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,154
Well, I'll remember for the both of us.

548
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:46,323
You made a deal you will regret.

549
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,428
You'll never know.

550
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,790
True.

551
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,712
But I'll die a queen,

552
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,973
not some mediocre, power-hungry girl.

To be entertained.

582
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,867
Served, coddled.

583
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:31,322
Loved.

584
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:34,072
Loved, like...

585
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,427
A child.

586
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:38,185
Okay, that's better
than my first thought.

587
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:39,876
Right now, he thinks
we're playing a game.

588
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,093
Hide and seek.

589
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:43,324
It's the only way to ensure
he'd stay diverted long enough

590
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,660
to let you in, and right
now, he's getting bored.

591
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:52,252
What's up?

592
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:56,393
In case I get held up.

593
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,606
Don't.

594
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,426
Hear me?

595
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:04,550
You got this, okay?

596
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,194
My love?

597
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:14,627
I found you! I tag you!

598
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,132
Give it a moment.

599
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,084
Does it have a name?

600
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,948
No.

601
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:28,810
What makes it so dangerous?

602
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:31,259
The gods created something
that simply...

603
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:32,780
wants.

604
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,296
So it has to know one secure place

605
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:35,430
and constant love.

606
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:36,551
If not,

607
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:38,032
if its appetite goes unfed

608
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,254
and it's unleashed,

609
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:42,353
even the gods can't stop it.

610
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:47,261
Love?

611
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:48,495
Come out!

612
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:50,311
Did you fall asleep?

613
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:52,763
Yeah, but what can it do?

614
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,560
Will you play with me?

615
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,296
Eliot! No!

616
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,150
Oh! No.

617
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:46,073
- Fuck, Eliot...
- How?

618
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,552
God-killing bullet.

619
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:49,476
This is not what we agreed on.

620
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:51,554
I didn't actually agree on anything,

621
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:53,631
but I did decide that
one of my best friends

622
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:56,187
wouldn't spend the rest of
his life locked in a prison,

623
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,820
guarding what turns out to be a
really not-so-scary monster.

624
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,614
Wait, where'd she go?

625
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:09,265
Anyway, it's done.

626
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:11,752
You spent a little bit
too much time as a king.

627
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,834
Well, that's really not
the issue now, is it?

628
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,257
Could've used some Goo
Gone and a toothbrush,

629
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:20,101
- but I think we're good to go.
- All right, let's go.

630
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:22,223
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- All right bitches,

631
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,810
everyone grab a key.

632
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:30,563
Alice, what are you doing?

633
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,266
Nothing good.

634
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:34,884
- No!
- Margo!

635
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:40,206
She's destroying the keys!

636
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:41,361
I have to.

637
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,351
You don't get to decide that the
whole universe doesn't have magic.

638
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,783
I'll never remember this.

639
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:55,551
Alice...

640
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,309
why?

641
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,277
You...

642
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,206
you talked me out of
working for the Library.

643
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:05,878
I realize there's no good side.

644
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:08,800
Magic just makes people
different shades of bad,

645
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:11,589
selfish and irresponsible.

646
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:12,770
We can't handle it!

647
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,306
You can't handle it.

648
00:31:14,393 --> 00:31:15,993
It's wrong.

649
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,594
We're wrong.

650
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:19,920
And it stops now!

651
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:32,142
What are you doing?

652
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:33,389
I'm gonna cut the bitch,

653
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:37,049
grab her fairy coke
power-up, and fix this.

654
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:40,264
<i>So, where shall we start?</i>

655
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,583
Ocean?

656
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,485
Cute little landmass?

657
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:44,850
Dealer's choice.

658
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:49,239
I know you can still feel them.

659
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,359
You need to let them go.

660
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:53,128
I know, but it's bad.

661
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,130
In a blink, it'll be good again,

662
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:57,496
and in two blinks, they'll be long gone.

663
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,536
<i>He's on the floor. He's...</i>

664
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,471
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

665
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:05,807
<i>He'll die, not giving up.</i>

666
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:07,838
Can't you feel his heart?

667
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,811
<i>No,</i>

668
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,543
<i>'cause I don't do what you're doing.</i>

669
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:17,988
You need to let them go.

670
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:20,584
Remember the future we're creating.

671
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,361
Will you play with me?

672
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:36,069
- Hey!
- Ah!

673
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,303
You think you can cast

674
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,584
faster than I can stab? Go!

675
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:42,082
- Please, listen to me. The knight...
- Ah, shut the... up and...

676
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:47,367
- Fix this.
- Now.

677
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,793
There's no point.

678
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:54,199
The magic's gone. It's done.

679
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,801
He's right.

680
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,195
Jules.

681
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,785
None of your pain
is what we'd call quiet,

682
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:10,043
especially yours.

683
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,082
I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

684
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,476
You'll see someday,

685
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:18,800
it wasn't.

686
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:21,790
For now,

687
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,837
I need you to stay out of the way.

688
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,590
I want you to know, it's your bravery...

689
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,738
made me see.

690
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:43,552
See what?

691
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:45,650
What I need to do.

692
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:53,044
What are you doing?

693
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,129
What Prometheus did.

694
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:56,770
Whore-crotching.

695
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:58,725
- Horcruxing.
- Oh.

696
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:00,608
- Look, Jules, are you sure?
- Shh.

697
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,959
Julia, you could lose your power.

698
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,013
- Hurry.
- You okay?

699
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:07,246
Okay, okay.

700
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:08,722
Hey, I got you. I got you.

701
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,793
Come on.

702
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,209
Are you okay?

703
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:14,207
It hurt.

704
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:18,090
And I'm not con...
connected to anything anymore.

705
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:22,098
- I got you.
- Are you guys ready?

706
00:35:24,593 --> 00:35:26,179
Let's do this.

707
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,296
Dean Fogg?

708
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,191
Travel, Penny,

709
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,056
I kill them all.

710
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,520
Irene...

711
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,538
We do have a deal.

712
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,967
Unless you want to have
a problem with the Library.

713
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:28,672
<i>The very essence is altered</i>

714
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:32,278
by the slightest deviation in
finger position. Watch closely.

715
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:39,749
The difference is in the position
of the right middle finger.

716
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:46,000
Sorry, looks like we're
having another...

717
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:48,689
power issue.

718
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:52,526
The rations are wholly inadequate.
I can't even assign homework!

719
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:53,992
Do the best you can.

720
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:57,388
I'll attempt to renegotiate
for our supply.

721
00:37:57,712 --> 00:37:58,778
How?

722
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:02,650
I'm afraid we can't revisit
your supply until next quarter.

723
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:04,381
I've spoken to the Board.

724
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,053
- Which Board?
- North American Fourth District.

725
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:10,467
Calgary enrollment hasn't
bounced back the way we have.

726
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:12,503
They're barely using
2/3 of their allotment,

727
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,692
and they've offered it to us.

728
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:17,766
Both you and they need
to bring a written request to...

729
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:22,771
In triplicate.

730
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,985
You'll have a decision by the 31st.

731
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,439
Excellent.

732
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:31,922
There's just one more request.

733
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,226
My answer hasn't changed.

734
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,275
She made a deal with us, then broke it.

735
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:37,743
Unlike the others,

736
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,903
she belongs to the Library.

737
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,940
I just would like to see her.

738
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,825
Please.

739
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,949
Where are they?

740
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,914
Per the... deal,

741
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,796
as struck with the Order,

742
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,251
safe.

743
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,034
No, no, no, no, no, they're not.

744
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:06,637
Alice, the McAllistairs can't find them,

745
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:08,258
and if they try,

746
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:10,140
the Library's retribution will be swift.

747
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,808
Not the McAllistairs!

748
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:12,929
That thing!

749
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:16,295
It can jump bodies, I told you.
You should know,

750
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,414
that alone is a very dangerous ability.

751
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,421
If they don't know who they
are, if they don't have magic,

752
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,795
they can't protect themselves.

753
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,582
Okay.

754
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:26,322
Hypothetically,

755
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:28,943
this thing gets loose.

756
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,404
Why would it go after them?

757
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:35,435
It's seen them.

758
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:38,412
It knows magic is back.

759
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:42,095
It knows they're Magicians,
even if they don't.

760
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:53,537
Sophie, hit pause
on your idiocy for a sec.

761
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:54,936
Janet?

762
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:57,276
Hi, I'm Isaac.

763
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:07,214
You're late. Me, too.

764
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,514
Uh, luckily, I don't recognize
the legality of red lights.

765
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,719
Quentin.

766
00:41:23,953 --> 00:41:25,197
I found you.

767
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,638
No, sorry, I'm Brian.

768
00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:31,923
Do a card trick for me, Quentin.

769
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:36,395
Come on.

770
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,402
Will you play with me?

771
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:42,303
I'm sorry, I think you've got me

772
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,943
mistaken for somebody else,
but I... you know...

773
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:47,408
<i>I saw it.</i>

774
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:48,976
<i>I've felt it!</i>

775
00:41:49,063 --> 00:41:51,275
Even the gods are afraid of it.

776
00:41:52,866 --> 00:41:55,196
This is your fault,
just as much as it is mine.

777
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:57,147
Get me out of here!

778
00:41:58,338 --> 00:42:02,018
Help me stop it.

779
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:19,851
Don't be scared.

780
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,407
This is great!

781
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:24,490
There's so much for us to do together.

782
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:27,146
I can't wait to get started

783
00:42:27,238 --> 00:42:31,147
on... all the people
who really deserve our wrath.

784
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,332
Um, no, look, please, I'm not... I...

785
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,194
This is gonna be so fun.

786
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:40,127
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.
