00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,474
ELIOT: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,404
I wouldn't. Playing with
time is such difficult magic.

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,116
QUENTIN: This is Jane
Chatwin, all grown up.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,405
We know about the time
loops that you keep making.

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,705
As you should by now.

6
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,541
Prince Ess of Loria.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,943
I like you.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,952
Tick, you're going to go to
that fairy repellent hallway

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,784
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,256
You're gonna put it in
the Fairy Queen's bath.

11
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,259
I'm gonna cut out
her heart and eat it.

12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,488
No, come on, Penny.
Don't... Don't... Come on.

13
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,258
I was astral projecting.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,764
I wasn't in my body when I died.

15
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,528
Thank you.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,364
You're missing the signs, Julia.

17
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,529
Help her, now.

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,731
Jesus.

19
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:42,969
Kady!

20
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,346
We've been... We've
been calling it the Truth Key,

21
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,350
'cause it... Well,
it reveals truths.

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,352
Mmm. I can
handle a little truth.

23
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,853
Oh, hey, Penny.

24
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,549
Wait.

25
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,694
Hi.

26
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,925
I was just leaving.

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,997
Okay.

28
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,431
Oh, hey, wait. I, um...

29
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,833
Um...

30
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,940
Um, don't talk shit on Penny.

31
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,839
He's... He's here.
He's coming with me.

32
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,411
QUENTIN: Oh, okay.

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,879
Hi, Penny.

34
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,640
Right, sorry. Um...

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,312
You heard about
Brakebills, right?

36
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,548
Well, it turns out,
the Physical Cottage

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,492
has been, like, magically
moved so many times

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,722
that, uh, there's
no valid deed on it,

39
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,493
so, like, you can't sell
something that you don't own,

40
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,124
so we can... Um...

41
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,964
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,437
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,973
I'm not trying to make it weird.

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,599
It's just weird now.

45
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,906
It just is. It's just weird.

46
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:51,978
Sorry.

47
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,977
So I'm going to take the
key so I can see Penny,

48
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,141
and I'll bring it back.

49
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,077
Okay.

50
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,052
You guys have fun. Mmm-hmm.

51
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,618
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

52
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,533
Sorry. I thought
you went to rehab.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,627
This is where they stick you
when you don't have insurance.

54
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,065
The upside?

55
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,067
I'm the least crazy
person in here.

56
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,506
What do you want?

57
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,176
Hold this.

58
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,251
Why?

59
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,794
Oh, my God! (GASPS)

60
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,762
No. No, no, no, wait!

61
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,393
You just need to hold this.

62
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,528
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

63
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,341
Oh, my God.

64
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,551
I'm just gonna give
you two a moment.

65
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,879
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

66
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,988
PENNY: Look, I know it's weird,

67
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,101
but at least I'm not stuck
in the fucking Underworld

68
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,825
for a billion years.

69
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,868
Why are you acting
like this is good news?

70
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,061
Because...

71
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,064
I'm not dead.

72
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,662
Yeah, well, I almost was.

73
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,535
Look... Look at me.

74
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,769
Look at where I am.

75
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,106
I know.

76
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,178
And I'm sorry.

77
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,241
I tried to save
you, and I failed,

78
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,686
and it broke me, and
now... Now you're... You're...

79
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,651
You're... You're what...
Some kind of ghost?

80
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,093
Astral projection.

81
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,857
What's the fucking difference?

82
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,558
I can't... I can't touch you.

83
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,193
I can't even see you without holding
a key. That makes me physically ill.

84
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,964
I can't...

85
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,500
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

86
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,276
Look, I'm here. That's all.

87
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,175
God, when does this end?

88
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,372
Let me help you.

89
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,409
(CHUCKLES)

90
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,551
How are you gonna help me?

91
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,544
Huh?

92
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,188
You're the reason
I'm in here, Penny.

93
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,385
Don't you fucking get that?

94
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,023
No, I have to put
myself back together.

95
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,827
Yeah, but, Kady, I...

96
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,666
No. If you say "I love you," I swear
to God, I will find a way to kill you.

97
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,363
At least then,
this would be over.

98
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:53,322
Whatever happens, remind me
never to take your advice again.

99
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,420
Let's go.

100
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:03,260
I'm sorry. You sent Fen
and Fray into the City?

101
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,770
They're gonna get eaten alive.

102
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,636
(SIGHS) She is a
knife maker's daughter.

103
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,334
She can handle herself.
(INHALES DEEPLY)

104
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,206
Besides, I sent them with Todd,

105
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,803
so it's not like I'm
completely irresponsible.

106
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,711
Look, if you really
want to talk about this

107
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,182
instead of getting over
Alice, then we can, but...

108
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,843
I'm sorry. Look...

109
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,648
I know that it's all
shitty right now, but...

110
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,191
At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

111
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,056
Mmm. Right?

112
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,996
And when we do, maybe Alice
will act like someone I recognize.

113
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,692
On the plus, you
didn't exaggerate.

114
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,897
This book is strangely
compelling, yet incomplete.

115
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,338
Yeah, it's a
one-step-at-a-time quest.

116
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,911
Um... Okay, so
the chapter, right?

117
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,642
It's about the daughter's
training to become a knight, right?

118
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,274
And it is... It's
sort of fascinating

119
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,616
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

120
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,679
Right. Cute. Where
do we get the key?

121
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,619
Um...

122
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,353
Right here.

123
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,952
Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,258
Familiar? Mmm-hmm.

125
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,826
It's the Mosaic.

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,027
What's the Mosaic?

127
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,160
The Mosaic.

128
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,433
Mmm-mmm. The puzzle.

129
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,563
Nope.

130
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,806
It's...

131
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,999
You use tiles...

132
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,339
Are you kidding me?

133
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,276
You use the tiles
to create a design

134
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,042
that reflects the
beauty of all life,

135
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,276
and when you do,
there's a mystery prize.

136
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,094
You've... Really, you've
never heard of this?

137
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,110
"The beauty of all life"?

138
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,884
Sounds appropriately
vague and impossible.

139
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,117
What's the prize?

140
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,423
A so-called key
to greater magic.

141
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,295
(EXHALES) Don't you
love it when the metaphors

142
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,423
turn out to be literal?

143
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,498
Let's go.

144
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,558
El, it's in Fillory.

145
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,537
You look nervous. (CHUCKLES)

146
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,909
Why would I be nervous?

147
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,673
I only collected a substance

148
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,443
I must assume the Fairy
Queen would kill me for having...

149
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,574
Shh.

150
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,613
Ovary up, Tick.

151
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,378
Let me see the jar.

152
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,785
Having scraped from the very
walls she is violently allergic to.

153
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,262
Nicely done. We need more.

154
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,094
This took me seven hours.

155
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,225
So seven more
hours should be easy.

156
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,827
We only get one shot
to slip this in her bath.

157
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,903
High Queen Margo.

00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,405
Join me, won't you?

159
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:30,008
All right. You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

160
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,211
A leader as brave
and cunning as yourself

161
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,484
knows that she needs alliances
in order to grow her kingdom.

162
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,649
Does she?

163
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,451
Consider this a wedding gift.

164
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,729
Well, don't just stand there.

165
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,661
You've got to get
ready for your guests.

166
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,801
Oh, fucking balls.

167
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,469
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

168
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,319
On Earth, we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first,

169
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,326
or at least know
where they come from.

170
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,953
Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

171
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,463
I mean, vaguely.

172
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,475
I was told they're marauding
dickholes who steal stuff.

173
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,058
Well, thanks to
the loss of magic,

174
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:25,230
their mountain crashed and
is now an island off your coast.

175
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:29,834
Their army, however,
numbers 4,000 spears.

176

tribe, it's yours.

already tried to trick me

into the whole "alliance
by wedding" thing.

180
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,952
I passed.

181
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,149
You had a choice back then.

182
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,220
Being a queen means
sacrificing for your people.

183
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,190
Get used to it.

184
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,891
Do you want to enlighten
me as to why you give a queef

185
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,411
whether I marry some
mountain turd or not?

186
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,301
No, I don't.

187
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,339
High Queen Margo. Jesus.

188
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,907
You scared me.

189
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,204
Were you talking to someone?

190
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,041
No, I just didn't
expect to see you there.

191
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,346
True.

192
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,540
Haven't seen you since...

193
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,383
After our own little near-miss,

194
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,284
I'm a little surprised
to see you running off

195
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,550
to the altar so soon.
I hear you there.

196
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,455
I mean, The Floating Mountain?

197
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,994
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

198
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,826
They have a real big army.

199
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,925
Well, whatever you plan on
doing with all that manpower,

200
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,561
I certainly hope it doesn't
put us on opposite sides.

201
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,971
High King Eliot and your
dad forged an alliance.

202
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,531
Nothing's changed.

203
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,936
(SIGHS)

204
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,336
Is this about the
time that we banged

205
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,540
and then I opted
out of marrying you?

206
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,843
Your insecurity
is showing, babe.

207
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,386
That was purely political.

208
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,415
But if we'd had another round,

209
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,055
I'm certain my charms
would lead you to reconsider...

210
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,320
my Queen.

211
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,757
I look forward to
our future talks.

212
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,266
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

213
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,070
and taken it upon themselves

214
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,512
to set up camp in your
very favorite hallway.

215
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,550
I fear there is no way to
complete the task we discussed.

216
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,982
Shit.

217
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,021
We have to figure
out another weapon.

218
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,957
In the meantime, I need
the fastest bunnies you got.

219
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,461
So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

220
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,054
Or was.

221
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,100
Um... So I figured, you
know, stick the key in...

222
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,362
Mmm. Wind it, and...

223
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,165
Logical. Right.

224
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:41,038
Except that there is not a... You
know, there's no keyhole anywhere.

225
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,905
It's chain-wound. Huh?

226
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,467
I took an elective in Horomancy.

227
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,241
At castle. Getting married.

228
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,646
Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

229
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,651
At castle. Getting married.

230
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,846
Does that sound like
Margo to you? Uh...

231
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,955
Need help now, dickwads.

232
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,284
Definitely Bambi.

233
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,323
Okay, we have to
find a way to get there.

234
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,190
Um, do you think that the key

235
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,196
can create a portal
to Fillory somehow?

236
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,424
Eliot, look.

237
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,897
I guess this is my cue.

238
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,672
(TICKING RAPIDLY)

239
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,518
Okay...

240
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,084
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

241
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,591
Okay.

242
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,390
Well, we should wait and
gather the troops, right?

243
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,326
Go time.

244
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,595
Guess this leg of the
quest is you and me.

245
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,333
Okay.

246
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,714
Okay, well, I hope that
was the right choice,

247
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,083
'cause the portal just closed.

248
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,721
Do you feel that?

249
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,849
Yeah.

250
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,020
Whoa.

251
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,294
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

252
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,626
Magic.

253
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,633
Magic. Eliot.

254
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,597
What? They...

255
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,127
How is it back?

256
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,228
It's not back.

257
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,475
ELIOT: Um... Is that...

258
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,637
They're constructing
the North Spire.

259
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,105
ELIOT: Which was built in...

260
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,758
QUENTIN: Decades
before the Chatwins arrived.

261
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,909
We're...

262
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,553
In Fillory in the past.

263
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,518
(EXHALES)

264
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,359
Oh, shit.

265
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,456
So, in the Fillory
books, Jane, um...

266
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,029
She decides to try
the Mosaic, right?

267
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,400
Uh, but she's too late.

268
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,530
Someone had
already solved it first.

269
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,373
Who?

270
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:59,003
Well, I don't know, but maybe it's
us, and that's why we're here now.

271
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,343
I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

272
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,406
when I'm on a
good deal of peyote.

273
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,916
Hmm.

274
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,989
Yoo-hoo. Hiya.

275
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,399
It's all yours...

276
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,438
If you don't mind wasting
your goddamn time.

277
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,310
Oh. Well...

278
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,877
Auspicious signs abound.

279
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,116
(SIGHS)

280
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,649
All right, so 784
tiles in 15 colors.

281
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:50,129
So that's 784
factorial, divided by...

282
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,596
Seriously?

283
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,509
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

284
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,435
Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

285
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,495
There's a finite set of
possible solutions, so...

286
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,068
Um...

287
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,112
Okay, yeah, that's
a lot of zeroes.

288
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,545
Um, how many zeroes?

289
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,874
Uh, to be exact? Yeah.

290
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,783
A shitload.

291
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,652
The mother of your
soon-to-be prince consort

292
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,122
wishes to meet with you.

293
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,783
Yeah, thanks. Not in the mood.

294
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,292
May I present,

295
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,660
from the Tribe of The Floating
Mountain That Is No Longer Floating,

296
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,256
Lady Agate Grey the Stone Queen.

297
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,460
Greetings, High Queen Margo.

298
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,129
Um... Hey, Stone Queen.

299
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,503
I'm actually glad you're here.

300
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:37,669
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

301
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,646
Well, I was led to believe this
was a matter of some urgency.

302
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,410
And who led you to believe that?

303
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,043
A mutual royal friend.

304
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,451
Very pale.

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,490
Look, I'm sure your
armies are super great.

306
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,751
It's just...

307
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,035
My own wedding was so long ago,

308
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,051
I forget how nervous
a bride can be.

309
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,187
(LAUGHS)

310
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,696
Perhaps we forgo superstition

311
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,531
and let you meet my
son before the ceremony.

312
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,832
Unless you think
that's too forward?

313
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,903
Fine.

314
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,475
I'd love to meet the man I'm
gonna marry in a couple hours.

315
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,565
Wonderful.

316
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,067
Invite the rest in.

317
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,841
Oh, stand up straight, darling.

318
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,612
May I present Prince Fomar.

319
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,778
Okay, no. Uh-uh.

320
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,351
Too freaky, even for me.

321
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,517
Oh, no, Your
Highness, of course not.

322
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,718
Fomar is far too young.

323
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,817
Mother.

324
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,557
A pebble's time will come, dear.

325
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,859
Fomar will be
your brother-in-law.

326
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,434
Uh...

327
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,096
Your betrothed...

328
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,834
Prince Micah.

329
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,739
Greetings, my Queen.

330
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,909
May our great mountain find
its way through your fertile valley.

331
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,886
Hello, Prince Micah.

332
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,891
Why don't you two take a moment
to get to know each other... Alone?

333
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,092
Let's go. Come on.

334
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,439
How can I make this
right for you, my Queen?

335
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:16,567
Are you one of those sick fuck princes
who likes to shoot girls with arrows,

336
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,544
or am I gonna wake up
tomorrow chained to a wall?

337
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,912
If you are, I will free
you, if you command.

338
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,746
You are a woman.

339
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,115
Okay.

340
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:31,253
Since you mention
women, let's discuss.

341
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,316
Our women are leaders.

342
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,588
They are the
cave, full of wisdom.

343
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,495
Men are the boulder,
full of strength.

344
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,590
The spear with the boulder...

345
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,929
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, okay.

346
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,435
I get the idea.

347
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,472
So, matriarchy, huh?

348
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,344
Society where women
hold the primary power.

349
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,880
Is that not the way it is
everywhere, my Queen?

350
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,142
(INHALES SHARPLY)

351
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,847
It is.

352
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,613
I still don't understand
why we have to do this

353
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,848
in the same room.

354
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,551
It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

355
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,793
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

356
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,071
(GASPS)

357
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,983
Oh, my Queen.

358
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,854
I am unharmed, and you?

359
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,514
I'm good.

360
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,622
Um... One sec, okay?

361
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,989
Mmm-hmm.

362
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,443
Are you seriously accusing
me of trying to kill Micah?

363
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,333
Why in Loria's
name would I do that?

364
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,306
I don't know. Why would you?

365
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,918
You know, you didn't
seem all that excited

366
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,753
about the wedding
yourself last time we talked.

367
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,838
Are you suggesting I did it?

368
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,850
Is your war council getting afraid
of our alliance with the Floaters?

369
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,783
You told me we
had nothing to fear.

370
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,014
And you told me you'd
win me with charm.

371
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,388
If I'd actually tried to kill that
walking jawline, he'd be dead.

372
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,359
It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

373
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,038
and tried to kill
someone to get your way.

374
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,725
Spoken like someone who's
really starting to miss me.

375
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,429
Honey... You ain't even top 50,

376
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,496
and you ain't getting another
chance to kill my husband.

377
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,767
Guards!

378
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,576
Lock him up.

379
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,936
And be a little rough about it.

380
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,590
Yeah, they're
still not moving, Q.

381
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,961
Son of a...

382
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,128
I checked... (EXHALES)

383
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,767
Look, I've checked the
Circumstances, and the Slavic is perfect.

384
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,067
It should work. I don't...

385
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,404
Unless magic
doesn't work on this.

386
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,603
Great. Brought back to
a time when magic exists

387
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,373
except on the one
thing that we need it to.

388
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,743
Okay, okay, so... So what?

389
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,991
We do it the old-fashioned way.

390
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,415
We're smart. We
can do hard things.

391
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,577
This is an
impossible thing, Eliot.

392
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,484
We have to show
the beauty of all life.

393
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,664
The beauty of all life? Yeah.

394
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,020
What does that mean,

395
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,834
and how are we supposed
to show it with tiles?

396
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,535
We're not gonna show it
with fucking math, Quentin!

397
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,824
This is the stupidest
puzzle! No, no, no.

398
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,025
This is our quest.

399
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,468
We have to do it ourselves.

400
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,470
I'm not saying that it's
not going to take a while.

401
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,976
Logic this with me
for one second, okay?

402
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,305
Hmm?

403
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,914
Jane came along too late, right?

404
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:46,942
Someone came to the Mosaic and
solved it before she even got here...

405
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,954
Gets here... Will get here.

406
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,514
You tried to convince me
that someone was us. Hmm?

407
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,831
Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

408
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,387
Well, in the absence of a better
option, let's... Let's at least try, huh?

409
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,693
(GROANS)

410
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,096
Is Penny with you?

411
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,072
He needed some time to himself.

412
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,307
What are you doing?

413
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,976
I've just been trying
to figure out this thing

414
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,535
that Penny told me...

415
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,774
Something that he
saw in the Astral Plane.

416
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:19,080
These aren't magic.
These are religion.

417
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,244
Yeah.

418
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,550
We're in that territory.

419
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,262
Alice needs your help.

420
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,630
Who are you?

421
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,702
Help her, Julia.

422
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,906
What the fuck?

423
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,379
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

424
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,452
Okay.

425
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,048
Let's go get a drink. Yeah?

426
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,255
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

427
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,197
Everyone, gather around.

428
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,432
Greetings, Fillorians, Floaters.

429
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,539
We gather to join
two great lands.

430
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,083
High Queen Margo,

431
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,598
do you take Micah of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain...

432
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,763
That Is No Longer
Floating to be yours,

433
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,771
binding your houses
together for eternity?

434
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,864
Oh, what the hell?

435
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,569
Traditional Earth saying.

436
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,977
Prince Micah,

437
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:58,916
do you take Margo of the
Tribe of Hanson to be yours,

438
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,715
binding your houses
together for eternity?

439
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,655
I do.

440
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,717
(BLADE SLICES) (GASPS)

441
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,828

442
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,460
(GASPS)

443
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:26,969
When the rock crumbles in our
hand, we must reach for the next.

444
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,508
Pickwick, continue, per custom.

445
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:31,845
What?

446
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,818
Yes, yes, of
course, you're right.

447
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,047
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

448
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,485
What are you talking about?

449
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,617
What custom?

450
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,562
When tragedy befalls
a royal wedding,

451
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,032
it is the solemn duty of the
surviving sibling to carry out...

452
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,124
(LOUDLY) What?

453
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,571
It is my duty and honor
to take the place of my...

454
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,568
Late brother.

455
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,602
But he... (BREATHES
SHAKILY) He fucking killed him.

456
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,307
He murdered his own brother!

457
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,043
That does not affect my duty.

458
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,745
Are you people all crazy?

459
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,820
Marry him...

460
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,260
Now.

461
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,132
(EXHALES)

462
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,406
(MUTTERING)

463
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,274
God damn it!

464
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,183
I'm done.

465
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,718
Okay.

466
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,244
Just don't take it apart
until I write it down.

467
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,449
Okay.

468
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,761
(PANTING)

469
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,765
God damn it.

470
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,567
I'll write it down.

471
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,865
Okay, yeah, so
you just fill in...

472
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,843
Fill that in with
red. Oh, my God.

473
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,904
You know, you're not going to get very far
if you're this frustrated after 14 days.

474
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,005
How are you not?

475
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,106
Oh, Q.

476
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,719
You know the answer.

477
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,018
<i>Can you imagine Margo
putting up with this tedium?</i>

478
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,785
QUENTIN: <i>No, not even a little.</i>

479
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,790
ELIOT: <i>She'd have
blown it up day two.</i>

480
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,754
What is that, anyway?

481
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,853
You know, not everything

482
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,660
has to look like
something, Eliot.

483
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:29,031
Ah, it's the eternal argument.

484
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:32,799
Realism versus
abstract expressionism.

485
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,396
Okay.

486
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,634
Green.

487
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,738
Green.

488
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,779
Yeah. Yeah, green one.

489
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,108
There.

490
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,409
No, no, there.

491
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,847
There? No.

492
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,214
There.

493
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,116
Just kidding. You had
it right the first time.

494
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,997
You know what? I'll tell
you where I'll put this.

495
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,284
Yeah? Come at me, Coldwater.

496
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,120
Peaches? Plums?

497
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,158
Arielle.

498
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,250
I'm Eliot.

499
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,371
This is my friend, Quentin.

500
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:57,395
Hi, there.

501
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,756
Hi.

502
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,124
Oh, this is my helper, Lunk.

503
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,306
Happy anniversary, Q.

504
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:10,343
To our first and last
year at this thing.

505
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,678
Hmm.

506
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,617
Hey. Hey.

507
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,850
Um, so...

508
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,119
Yeah.

509
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,419
Um...

510
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,664
Let's just save our overthinking
for the puzzle, yeah?

511
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,132
Yeah.

512
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,224
We could be done
tomorrow for all you know.

513
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,350
We can't just throw away
all this time we've invested.

514
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,285
You want to live
your life, live it here.

515
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,844
What is that supposed to mean?

516
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,981
You know exactly
what that means.

517
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,257
Oops.

518
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,196
I don't know. It's just...

519
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,094
Hey.

520
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,399
Hey.

521
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,067
No Lunk today?

522
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,305
Found him holding
someone else's peaches.

523
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,275
Sorry, I...

524
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,397
I mean, I always thought you
were too good for him anyway.

525
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,454

(INAUDIBLE)

527
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,459
Come visit soon.

528
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,834
Of course.

529
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,503
If we're not here...
I know, Dad.

530
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,237
I love you, too.

531
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,513
(GRUNTS)

532
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,422
You ever think about them?

533
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,493
My grandkids?

534
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,688
No...

535
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,025
Our friends...

536
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,829
From our lives before.

537
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,202
I dream about them sometimes.

538
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,634
Hmm.

539
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,118
Eliot...

540
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,441
Did you just solve the Mosaic?

541
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,212
With a friend.

542
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,147
We solved it together.

543
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,589
Well, this is dreadful!

544
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:54,786

545
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,520

You do look...

549
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,501
Ah, just one of those faces.

550
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,036
The dwarves...

551
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,138
They built me this watch.

552
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,501
It's terribly important.

553
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,440
I need that key to power it.

554
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,585

It's just...

556
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,012
My brother, he's...

557
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,058
He's become dangerous,
and I'm trying to stop him.

558
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,620
The dwarves told me if everything
gets too buggered up to fix,

559
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,462
I could use this watch.

560
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,058
To create time loops.

561
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,267

to stop The Beast.

You have to take it.

571
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,841
We must become one flesh.

Right? I told you...
It's Earth tradition.

573
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:56,347
But must you really open every
present before we can consummate?

574
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,940
Well, if I don't...

drop off like an overripe banana.

Hello, Margo.

Hi.

591
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,858
Didn't you die?

592
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,796
On the linear plane, yes.

593
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,801
Not here, in the Clock Barrens.

594
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:23,868
Right.

595
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,439
So some kind of timey-wimey
magic going on here.

596

Time loops are
not my only trick.

597
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,075

exist at the same time,

599
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,206
overlapping.

600
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,781
So, even if you're dead...

601
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,476
You're alive here.

602
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,519
And dead, too, I suppose.

603
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,451
This is a place outside of time.

604
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,285
Well, I got a note from Quentin.

605
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,722
He told me you
could give me a key.

606
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,258
Yes.

607
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,658
The key is here, but
I can't give it to you.

608
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,663
It's what keeps the
Clock Barrens stable.

609
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,341
That said, I would
like to help you, Margo.

610
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,027
I don't need help.
I need the key.

611
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,633
Now, I'm sorry, but I've
had a bad couple of days,

612
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,467
and my best friends are dead,

613
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,737
and, frankly, I wish I had
your magic, or any magic,

my own Clock Barrens

be so chipper about it?

over, and I lost Alice,

her back, I lost magic.

mercy, you earned this.

No, I don't.

Kady, have a seat, please.

you're talking to?
