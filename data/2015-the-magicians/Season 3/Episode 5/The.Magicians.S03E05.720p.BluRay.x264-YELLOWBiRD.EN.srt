1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,454
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,378
I wouldn't. Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,046
This is Jane Chatwin,
all grown up.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,374
We know about the time loops
that you keep making.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,675
As you should by now.

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,548
Prince Ess of Loria.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,921
I like you.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,929
Tick, you're going to go to
that fairy repellent hallway

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,762
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,222
You're gonna put it
in the Fairy Queen's bath.

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,228
I'm gonna cut out
her heart and eat it.

12
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,480
No, come on, Penny.
Don't... Don't... Come on.

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,232
I was astral projecting.

14
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,733
I wasn't in my body when I died.

15
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,530
Thank you.

16
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,358
You're missing the signs, Julia.

17
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,535
Help her, now.

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,707
Jesus.

19
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,953
Kady!

20
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,330
We've been... We've been
calling it the Truth Key,

21
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,335
'cause it...
Well, it reveals truths.

22
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,337
Mmm. I can handle
a little truth.

23
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,838
Oh, hey, Penny.

24
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,553
Wait.

25
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,686
Hi.

26
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,895
I was just leaving.

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,981
Okay.

28
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,439
Oh, hey, wait. I, um...

29
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,819
Um...

30
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,900
Um, don't talk shit on Penny.

31
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,823
He's... He's here.
He's coming with me.

32
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,411
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,862
Hi, Penny.

34
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,660
Right, sorry. Um...

35
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,329
You heard
about Brakebills, right?

36
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,542
Well, it turns out,
the Physical Cottage

37
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,466
has been, like,
magically moved so many times

38
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,714
that, uh,
there's no valid deed on it,

39
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,467
so, like, you can't sell
something that you don't own,

40
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,139
so we can... Um...

41
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,428
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,933
I'm not trying to make it weird.

43
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,606
It's just weird now.

44
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,900
It just is. It's just weird.

45
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:51,986
Sorry.

46
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,946
So I'm going to take the key
so I can see Penny,

47
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,148
and I'll bring it back.

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,073
Okay.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,026
- You guys have fun.
- Mmm-hmm.

50
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,506
Sorry. I thought
you went to rehab.

51
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,630
This is where they stick you
when you don't have insurance.

52
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,049
The upside?

53
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,056
I'm the least
crazy person in here.

54
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,510
What do you want?

55
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,148
Hold this.

56
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,234
Why?

57
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,783
Oh, my God!

58
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,748
No. No, no, no, wait!

59
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,370
You just need to hold this.

60
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,332
Oh, my God.

61
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,556
I'm just gonna
give you two a moment.

62
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,885
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

63
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,982
Look, I know it's weird,

64
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,089
but at least I'm not stuck
in the fucking Underworld

65
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,820
for a billion years.

66
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,865
Why are you acting
like this is good news?

67
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,067
Because...

68
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,030
I'm not dead.

69
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,657
Yeah, well, I almost was.

70
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,535
Look... Look at me.

71
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,741
Look at where I am.

72
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,076
I know.

73
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,169
And I'm sorry.

74
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,214
I tried to save you,
and I failed,

75
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,669
and it broke me, and now...
Now you're... You're...

76
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,637
You're... You're what...
Some kind of ghost?

77
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,059
Astral projection.

78
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,852
What's the fucking difference?

79
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,554
I can't... I can't touch you.

80
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,187
I can't even see you without holding a key.
That makes me physically ill.

81
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,939
I can't...

82
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,189
I...

83
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,237
Look, I'm here. That's all.

84
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,158
God, when does this end?

85
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,361
Let me help you.

86
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,534
How are you gonna help me?

87
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,539
Huh?

88
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,171
You're the reason
I'm in here, Penny.

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,374
Don't you fucking get that?

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,004
No, I have to put myself
back together.

91
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,804
Yeah, but, Kady, I...

92
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,680
No. If you say "I love you," I swear
to God, I will find a way to kill you.

93
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,346
At least then,
this would be over.

94
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,325
Whatever happens,
remind me never to take your advice again.

95
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,417
Let's go.

96
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,256
I'm sorry. You sent
Fen and Fray into the City?

97
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,756
They're gonna get eaten alive.

98
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,633
She is a knife maker's daughter.

99
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,305
She can handle herself.

100
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,178
Besides, I sent them with Todd,

101
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,806
so it's not like
I'm completely irresponsible.

102
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,683
Look, if you really want
to talk about this

103
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,140
instead of getting over Alice,
then we can, but...

104
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,850
I'm sorry. Look...

105
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,653
I know that it's all shitty
right now, but...

106
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,152
At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

107
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,029
- Mmm.
- Right?

108
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,987
And when we do, maybe Alice will
act like someone I recognize.

109
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,663
On the plus,
you didn't exaggerate.

110
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,868
This book is strangely compelling,
yet incomplete.

111
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,330
Yeah, it's
a one-step-at-a-time quest.

112
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:44,880
Um...
Okay, so the chapter, right?

113
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,634
It's about the daughter's training
to become a knight, right?

114
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,259
And it is...
It's sort of fascinating

115
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,593
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

116
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,679
Right. Cute.
Where do we get the key?

117
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,597
Um...

118
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,350
Right here.

119
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,945
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,270
- Familiar?
- Mmm-hmm.

121
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,815
It's the Mosaic.

122
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,024
What's the Mosaic?

123
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,154
The Mosaic.

124
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,402
- Mmm-mmm.
- The puzzle.

125
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,577
Nope.

126
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,789
It's...

127
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,993
You use tiles...

128
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,325
Are you kidding me?

129
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,251
You use the tiles
to create a design

130
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,044
that reflects
the beauty of all life,

131
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,248
and when you do,
there's a mystery prize.

132
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,101
You've... Really,
you've never heard of this?

133
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,092
"The beauty of all life"?

134
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,886
Sounds appropriately vague
and impossible.

135
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,134
What's the prize?

136
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,389
A so-called key
to greater magic.

137
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,265
Don't you love it
when the metaphors

138
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,391
turn out to be literal?

139
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,481
Let's go.

140
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,558
El, it's in Fillory.

141
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,531
You look nervous.

142
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,903
Why would I be nervous?

143
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,656
I only collected a substance

144
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,409
I must assume the Fairy Queen
would kill me for having...

145
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,579
Shh.

146
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,616
Ovary up, Tick.

147
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,369
Let me see the jar.

148
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,755
Having scraped from the very walls
she is violently allergic to.

149
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,257
Nicely done. We need more.

150
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,088
This took me seven hours.

151
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,219
So seven more hours
should be easy.

152
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,801
We only get one shot
to slip this in her bath.

153
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,895
High Queen Margo.

154
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,388
Join me, won't you?

155
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,986
All right. You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

156
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,192
A leader as brave
and cunning as yourself

157
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,450
knows that she needs alliances
in order to grow her kingdom.

158
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,655
Does she?

159
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,457
Consider this a wedding gift.

160
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,706
Well, don't just stand there.

161
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,667
You've got to get ready
for your guests.

162
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,797
Oh, fucking balls.

163
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,314
On Earth, we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first,

164
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,320
or at least know
where they come from.

165
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,948
Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

166
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,448
I mean, vaguely.

167
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,475
I was told they're marauding
dickholes who steal stuff.

168
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,035
Well, thanks to the loss
of magic,

169
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,211
their mountain crashed and is
now an island off your coast.

170
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,836
Their army, however,
numbers 4,000 spears.

171
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,380
Marry into the tribe,
it's yours.

172
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,013
Look, somebody already
tried to trick me

173
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,513
into the whole
"alliance by wedding" thing.

174
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,934
I passed.

175
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,138
You had a choice back then.

176
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:48,226
Being a queen means
sacrificing for your people.

177
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,190
Get used to it.

178
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,856
Do you want to enlighten me
as to why you give a queef

179
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,428
whether I marry
some mountain turd or not?

180
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,284
No, I don't.

181
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,327
- High Queen Margo.
- Jesus.

182
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,864
You scared me.

183
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,199
Were you talking to someone?

184
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,036
No, I just didn't expect
to see you there.

185
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,337
True.

186
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,546
Haven't seen you since...

187
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,375
After our own little near-miss,

188
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,256
I'm a little surprised
to see you running off

189
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,553
- to the altar so soon.
- I hear you there.

190
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,426
I mean, The Floating Mountain?

191
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,974
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

192
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,804
They have a real big army.

193
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,891
Well, whatever you plan
on doing with all that manpower,

194
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,567
I certainly hope it doesn't
put us on opposite sides.

195
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,942
High King Eliot and your dad
forged an alliance.

196
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,523
Nothing's changed.

197
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,319
Is this about the time
that we banged

198
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,529
and then I opted
out of marrying you?

199
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,831
Your insecurity
is showing, babe.

200
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,375
That was purely political.

201
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,412
But if we'd had another round,

202
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,044
I'm certain my charms would
lead you to reconsider...

203
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,337
my Queen.

204
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,760
I look forward
to our future talks.

205
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,270
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

206
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,064
and taken it upon themselves

207
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,485
to set up camp in your
very favorite hallway.

208
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,530
I fear there is no way to
complete the task we discussed.

209
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,982
Shit.

210
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,990
We have to figure out
another weapon.

211
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,949
In the meantime,
I need the fastest bunnies you got.

212
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,452
So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

213
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,037
Or was.

214
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,088
Um... So I figured, you know,
stick the key in...

215
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,336
- Mmm.
- Wind it, and...

216
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,133
- Logical.
- Right.

217
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,009
Except that there is not a...
You know, there's no keyhole anywhere.

218
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,886
- It's chain-wound.
- Huh?

219
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,467
I took an elective in Horomancy.

220
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,224
At castle. Getting married.

221
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,646
Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

222
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,644
At castle. Getting married.

223
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,851
- Does that sound like Margo to you?
- Uh...

224
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,940
Need help now, dickwads.

225
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,279
Definitely Bambi.

226
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,314
Okay, we have to find
a way to get there.

227
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,150
Um, do you think that the key

228
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,156
can create a portal
to Fillory somehow?

229
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,407
Eliot, look.

230
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,910
I guess this is my cue.

231
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,512
Okay...

232
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,560
Okay.

233
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,393
Well, we should wait
and gather the troops, right?

234
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,321
Go time.

235
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,615
Guess this leg of the quest
is you and me.

236
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,322
Okay.

237
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,714
Okay, well, I hope that was
the right choice,

238
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,087
'cause the portal just closed.

239
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,713
Do you feel that?

240
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,842
Yeah.

241
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,009
Whoa.

242
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,264
Oh, my God.

243
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,596
Magic.

244
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,646
- Magic.
- Eliot.

245
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,603
- What?
- They...

246
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,111
How is it back?

247
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,232
It's not back.

248
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,441
Um... Is that...

249
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,651
They're constructing
the North Spire.

250
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,078
Which was built in...

251
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,700
Decades before
the Chatwins arrived.

252
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,907
We're...

253
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,535
In Fillory in the past.

254
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,340
Oh, shit.

255
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,467
So, in the Fillory books,
Jane, um...

256
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,011
She decides to try
the Mosaic, right?

257
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,388
Uh, but she's too late.

258
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,515
Someone had already
solved it first.

259
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,356
Who?

260
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,984
Well, I don't know, but maybe it's us,
and that's why we're here now.

261
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,312
I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

262
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,398
when I'm on a good deal
of peyote.

263
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,907
Hmm.

264
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,991
Yoo-hoo. Hiya.

265
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,374
It's all yours...

266
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,424
If you don't mind wasting
your goddamn time.

267
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,304
Oh. Well...

268
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,890
Auspicious signs abound.

269
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,652
All right,
so 784 tiles in 15 colors.

270
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:50,112
So that's 784 factorial,
divided by...

271
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,570
Seriously?

272
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,517
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

273
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,409
Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

274
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,495
There's a finite set
of possible solutions, so...

275
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,080
Um...

276
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,092
Okay, yeah,
that's a lot of zeroes.

277
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,545
Um, how many zeroes?

278
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,888
- Uh, to be exact?
- Yeah.

279
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,757
A shitload.

280
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,644
The mother of your
soon-to-be prince consort

281
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,096
wishes to meet with you.

282
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,772
Yeah, thanks. Not in the mood.

283
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,269
May I present,

284
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,649
from the Tribe of The Floating Mountain
That Is No Longer Floating,

285
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,230
Lady Agate Grey the Stone Queen.

286
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,441
Greetings, High Queen Margo.

287
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,117
Um... Hey, Stone Queen.

288
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,491
I'm actually glad you're here.

289
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,666
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

290
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,620
Well, I was led to believe this
was a matter of some urgency.

291
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,376
And who led you to believe that?

292
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,049
A mutual royal friend.

293
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,421
Very pale.

294
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,471
Look, I'm sure your armies
are super great.

295
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,717
It's just...

296
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,035
My own wedding was so long ago,

297
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,051
I forget how nervous
a bride can be.

298
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,681
Perhaps we forgo superstition

299
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,516
and let you meet my son
before the ceremony.

300
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,817
Unless you think
that's too forward?

301
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,903
Fine.

302
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,447
I'd love to meet the man I'm
gonna marry in a couple hours.

303
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,569
Wonderful.

304
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,067
Invite the rest in.

305
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,829
Oh, stand up straight, darling.

306
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,578
May I present Prince Fomar.

307
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,785
Okay, no. Uh-uh.

308
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,337
Too freaky, even for me.

309
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,506
Oh, no, Your Highness,
of course not.

310
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,707
Fomar is far too young.

311
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,801
Mother.

312
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,548
A pebble's time will come, dear.

313
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,843
Fomar will be
your brother-in-law.

314
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,434
Uh...

315
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,096
Your betrothed...

316
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,804
Prince Micah.

317
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,730
Greetings, my Queen.

318
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,897
May our great mountain find its
way through your fertile valley.

319
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,866
Hello, Prince Micah.

320
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,868
Why don't you two take a moment to
get to know each other... Alone?

321
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,083
Let's go. Come on.

322
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,427
How can I make this right
for you, my Queen?

323
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,553
Are you one of those sick fuck princes
who likes to shoot girls with arrows,

324
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,510
or am I gonna wake up tomorrow
chained to a wall?

325
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,893
If you are, I will free you,
if you command.

326
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,723
You are a woman.

327
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,103
Okay.

328
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:31,230
Since you mention women,
let's discuss.

329
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,316
Our women are leaders.

330
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,571
They are the cave,
full of wisdom.

331
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,495
Men are the boulder,
full of strength.

332
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,573
The spear with the boulder...

333
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,907
Yeah, okay.

334
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,412
I get the idea.

335
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,460
So, matriarchy, huh?

336
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,338
Society where women
hold the primary power.

337
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,841
Is that not the way
it is everywhere, my Queen?

338
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,843
It is.

339
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,602
I still don't understand
why we have to do this

340
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,848
in the same room.

341
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,563
It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

342
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,964
Oh, my Queen.

343
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,839
I am unharmed, and you?

344
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,511
I'm good.

345
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,642
Um... One sec, okay?

346
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,973
Mmm-hmm.

347
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,394
Are you seriously accusing me
of trying to kill Micah?

348
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,316
Why in Loria's name
would I do that?

349
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,272
I don't know. Why would you?

350
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,926
You know, you didn't seem
all that excited

351
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,761
about the wedding yourself
last time we talked.

352
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,823
Are you suggesting I did it?

353
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,827
Is your war council getting afraid
of our alliance with the Floaters?

354
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,749
You told me
we had nothing to fear.

355
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,998
And you told me
you'd win me with charm.

356
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,377
If I'd actually tried to kill that
walking jawline, he'd be dead.

357
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,332
It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

358
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,029
and tried to kill someone
to get your way.

359
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,716
Spoken like someone who's
really starting to miss me.

360
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:23,426
Honey... You ain't even top 50,

361
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,513
and you ain't getting another
chance to kill my husband.

362
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,772
Guards!

363
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,562
Lock him up.

364
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,939
And be a little rough about it.

365
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,585
Yeah, they're still
not moving, Q.

366
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,957
Son of a...

367
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,128
I checked...

368
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,753
Look, I've checked the Circumstances,
and the Slavic is perfect.

369
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,053
It should work. I don't...

370
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,381
Unless magic
doesn't work on this.

371
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,592
Great. Brought back to a time
when magic exists

372
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,365
except on the one thing
that we need it to.

373
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,723
Okay, okay, so... So what?

374
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,999
We do it the old-fashioned way.

375
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,389
We're smart.
We can do hard things.

376
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,566
This is
an impossible thing, Eliot.

377
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,484
We have to show
the beauty of all life.

378
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,672
- The beauty of all life?
- Yeah.

379
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,982
What does that mean,

380
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,842
and how are we supposed
to show it with tiles?

381
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,552
We're not gonna show it
with fucking math, Quentin!

382
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,818
- This is the stupidest puzzle!
- No, no, no.

383
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,037
- I...
- This is our quest.

384
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,456
We have to do it ourselves.

385
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,456
I'm not saying that it's not
going to take a while.

386
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,967
Logic this with me
for one second, okay?

387
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,294
Hmm?

388
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,880
Jane came along too late, right?

389
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,933
Someone came to the Mosaic and solved
it before she even got here...

390
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,931
Gets here... Will get here.

391
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,514
You tried to convince me
that someone was us. Hmm?

392
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,848
Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

393
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,361
Well, in the absence of a better option,
let's... Let's at least try, huh?

394
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,075
Is Penny with you?

395
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,074
He needed some time to himself.

396
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,284
What are you doing?

397
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,950
I've just been trying
to figure out this thing

398
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,535
that Penny told me...

399
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,746
Something that he saw
in the Astral Plane.

400
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,049
These aren't magic.
These are religion.

401
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,251
Yeah.

402
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,544
We're in that territory.

403
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,268
Alice needs your help.

404
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,641
Who are you?

405
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,687
Help her, Julia.

406
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,903
What the fuck?

407
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,461
Okay.

408
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,043
Let's go get a drink. Yeah?

409
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,180
Everyone, gather around.

410
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,438
Greetings, Fillorians, Floaters.

411
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,524
We gather to join
two great lands.

412
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,074
High Queen Margo,

413
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:38,583
do you take Micah of the Tribe
of The Floating Mountain...

414
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,758
That Is No Longer Floating
to be yours,

415
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,756
binding your houses together
for eternity?

416
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,883
Oh, what the hell?

417
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,549
Traditional Earth saying.

418
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,969
Prince Micah,

419
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:58,899
do you take Margo of the
Tribe of Hanson to be yours,

420
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,727
binding your houses together
for eternity?

421
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,655
I do.

422
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:26,969
When the rock crumbles in our hand,
we must reach for the next.

423
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,508
Pickwick, continue, per custom.

424
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,840
What?

425
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes, yes,
of course, you're right.

426
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,470
What are you talking about?

427
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,602
What custom?

428
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,528
When tragedy befalls
a royal wedding,

429
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,027
it is the solemn duty of the
surviving sibling to carry out...

430
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,117
What?

431
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,571
It is my duty and honor
to take the place of my...

432
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,580
Late brother.

433
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,585
But he... He fucking killed him.

434
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,287
He murdered his own brother!

435
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,043
That does not affect my duty.

436
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,753
Are you people all crazy?

437
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,803
Marry him...

438
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,260
Now.

439
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,283
God damn it!

440
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm done.

441
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,707
Okay.

442
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,252
Just don't take it apart
until I write it down.

443
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,455
Okay.

444
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,765
God damn it.

445
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,555
I'll write it down.

446
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,851
Okay, yeah,
so you just fill in...

447
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,809
- Fill that in with red.
- Oh, my God.

448
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:08,896
You know, you're not going to get very far
if you're this frustrated after 14 days.

449
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,989
How are you not?

450
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,110
Oh, Q.

451
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,696
You know the answer.

452
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,995
<i>Can you imagine Margo
putting up with this tedium?</i>

453
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,788
<i>No, not even a little.</i>

454
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,787
<i>She'd have blown it up day two.</i>

455
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,751
What is that, anyway?

456
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,837
You know, not everything

457
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,629
has to look
like something, Eliot.

458
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,002
Ah, it's the eternal argument.

459
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,803
Realism versus
abstract expressionism.

460
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,389
Okay.

461
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,634
Green.

462
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,716
Green.

463
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,767
- Yeah.
- Yeah, green one.

464
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,094
There.

465
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,395
No, no, there.

466
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,813
- There?
- No.

467
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,185
There.

468
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,107
Just kidding.
You had it right the first time.

469
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,005
You know what?
I'll tell you where I'll put this.

470
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,270
Yeah? Come at me, Coldwater.

471
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,105
Peaches? Plums?

472
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,158
Arielle.

473
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,243
I'm Eliot.

474
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,388
This is my friend, Quentin.

475
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,412
Hi, there.

476
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,744
Hi.

477
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,118
Oh, this is my helper, Lunk.

478
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,295
Happy anniversary, Q.

479
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,340
To our first and last year
at this thing.

480
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,674
Hmm.

481
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

482
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,925
I...

483
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,855
Um, so...

484
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,100
Yeah.

485
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,441
Um...

486
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,652
Let's just save our overthinking
for the puzzle, yeah?

487
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,112
Yeah.

488
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,224
We could be done tomorrow
for all you know.

489
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,339
We can't just throw away
all this time we've invested.

490
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,259
You want to live your life,
live it here.

491
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,835
What is that supposed to mean?

492
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,966
You know exactly
what that means.

493
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,265
Oops.

494
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,185
I don't know. It's just...

495
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,394
Hey.

496
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,067
No Lunk today?

497
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,317
Found him holding
someone else's peaches.

498
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,286
Sorry, I...

499
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,405
I mean, I always thought you
were too good for him anyway.

500
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,459
Come visit soon.

501
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,839
Of course.

502
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,508
- If we're not here...
- I know, Dad.

503
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,220
I love you, too.

504
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,407
You ever think about them?

505
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,493
My grandkids?

506
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,694
No...

507
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,030
Our friends...

508
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,825
From our lives before.

509
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,209
I dream about them sometimes.

510
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,623
Hmm.

511
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,106
Eliot...

512
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,441
Did you just solve the Mosaic?

513
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,191
With a friend.

514
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,161
We solved it together.

515
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,577
Well, this is dreadful!

516
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,783
You see...

517
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,494
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude.

518
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,749
- My name is...
- Jane Chatwin.

519
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,581
Do I know you?

520
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,542
You do look...

521
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,501
Ah, just one of those faces.

522
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,053
The dwarves...

523
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,138
They built me this watch.

524
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,512
It's terribly important.

525
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,432
I need that key to power it.

526
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,563
It sort of took us a while to...

527
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,859
It's just...

528
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,023
My brother, he's...

529
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,070
He's become dangerous,
and I'm trying to stop him.

530
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,620
The dwarves told me if everything
gets too buggered up to fix,

531
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,447
I could use this watch.

532
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,077
To create time loops.

533
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,252
You need the key
to stop The Beast.

534
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,875
What's The Beast?

535
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,209
Unfortunately, you'll find out.

536
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,138
Mmm...

537
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,056
Uh...

538
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,727
You have to take it.

539
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,855
Here.

540
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,778
Thank you.

541
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,776
My Queen,
time to complete our marriage.

542
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,821
We must become one flesh.

543
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,366
- Right?
- I told you... It's Earth tradition.

544
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,321
But must you really open every present
before we can consummate?

545
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,951
Well, if I don't...

546
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:04,663
Your manhood will rot and drop off
like an overripe banana.

547
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,463
Better not to chance it.

548
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,757
Don't wait up.

549
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,279
<i>So I arranged for this to be
delivered the day of your wedding,</i>

550
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,235
<i>way, way in advance.</i>

551
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,365
<i>Long story.</i>

552
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,539
<i>Anyway, I hope you're okay.</i>

553
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,832
<i>No easy way to say this,
so I'lljust say it.</i>

554
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,127
<i>Eliot and I are both dead.</i>

555
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,127
<i>The quest sent us to the past...
Again, super-long story...</i>

556
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:54,429
<i>And you should know
that we led full, good lives,</i>

557
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,884
<i>and we took the quest
as far as we could, and...</i>

558
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,515
<i>Now there's something
that we need you to do.</i>

559
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,482
Hello, Margo.

560
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,527
Hi.

561
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,828
Didn't you die?

562
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,780
On the linear plane, yes.

563
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,786
Not here, in the Clock Barrens.

564
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,876
Right.

565
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,416
So some kind of timey-wimey
magic going on here.

566
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,543
Time loops
are not my only trick.

567
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,044
Here I managed to create a spot

568
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,921
where all moments exist
at the same time,

569
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,218
overlapping.

570
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,762
So, even if you're dead...

571
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,464
You're alive here.

572
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,515
And dead, too, I suppose.

573
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,434
This is a place outside of time.

574
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,262
Well, I got a note from Quentin.

575
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,716
He told me you could
give me a key.

576
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,231
Yes.

577
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,650
The key is here,
but I can't give it to you.

578
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,648
It's what keeps
the Clock Barrens stable.

579
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,341
That said, I would like
to help you, Margo.

580
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,027
I don't need help.
I need the key.

581
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,610
Now, I'm sorry, but I've had
a bad couple of days,

582
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,444
and my best friends are dead,

583
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,703
and, frankly, I wish I had
your magic, or any magic,

584
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,829
'cause I'd like to build
my own Clock Barrens

585
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,457
right about now
and just live there

586
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,290
for, like,
five minutes without anyone trying to usurp

587
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,467
or marry or educate or hump me.

588
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,964
It is exhausting.

589
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:21,808
You're going to be a very,
very powerful Magician and queen.

590
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,307
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

591
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,684
Eliot and Quentin
make all the real moves.

592
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,312
I'm more of a Fillorian
middle manager.

593
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,439
I know how that feels.

594
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,192
Sometimes like you're a supporting
player in somebody else's story.

595
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,616
Your tale is your own, Margo.

596
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,661
You may not get the appreciation
you deserve, frankly,

597
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:47,492
or the peace, but it is yours,
and I can tell you, it won't be boring.

598
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,960
Thank you.

599
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,254
Now, as to how I can help...
Out there in the linear plane,

600
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,959
the key rests on my body
at Brakebills.

601
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,885
I can send you there,
no problem.

602
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,838
You're telling me
to dig up your corpse.

603
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,673
How the hell can you be
so chipper about it?

604
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,633
Eh, hasn't happened yet.

605
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,310
And I'm very English.

606
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,101
It's been so good
to chat to you, Margo.

607
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,728
Ready to go?

608
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,480
Yeah.

609
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,404
I guess this is my cue.

610
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,864
Wait!

611
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,032
You bitches looking for these?

612
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,331
Fuck.

613
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,754
That entrance line was the only
thing keeping me going

614
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,376
through six feet of dirt
and corpse.

615
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,958
Bambi. Hey.

616
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,840
And I swore I wouldn't do this.

617
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,049
Wow.

618
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,055
I mean, I can't believe we died.

619
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,145
Sort of weird.

620
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,470
Sad, right?

621
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,850
But we didn't die.

622
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,650
It was an alternate timeline and
one that we never have to live now.

623
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,477
Margo, you saved our lives.

624
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,735
In addition to robbing
the cradle and a grave.

625
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,942
I'll never get that smell
out of my hair.

626
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,406
I mean, I know who I was.

627
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,366
I was Alice Quinn.

628
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,329
I was the best at something,
at magic,

629
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,381
but then magic took over,
and I lost Alice,

630
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,504
and by the time I got her back,
I lost magic.

631
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,586
Okay, so how can I help?

632
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,889
I could use magic,
and you have it.

633
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,807
- Why do you have it?
- Mmm.

634
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,810
Prevailing theory?

635
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,809
Extra sprinkles on the cupcake
from when Our Lady Underground

636
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,858
restored my Shade, but...

637
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,652
She didn't exactly
leave a note, so...

638
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,104
So you don't know.

639
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,066
I mean, do I want to know?

640
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,650
Yes.

641
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,701
I mean, if you want to understand it,
you need to know.

642
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,916
Hey, all magic has a provenance.

643
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,085
There was this machine
that the professors would use.

644
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,793
Yeah, Q showed it to me,
but it doesn't work anymore.

645
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,629
Right, of course not.

646
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,136
What about the key?

647
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,634
It shows
the truth of things, right?

648
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,595
Have you tried using that?

649
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,100
I've held it.

650
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,982
Maybe a mirror
could help you focus it.

651
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,947
Yeah, okay.

652
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:42,879
What?

653
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,133
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,190
Have a seat, Julia.

655
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,102
It's time for us to talk.

656
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,034
What did you do to me?

657
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,869
I planted a seed
for you to grow.

658
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:15,079
Without telling me or asking me?

659
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,206
I've tried to guide you
as gently as I could.

660
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,083
I saw his eyes.

661
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,086
I saw Reynard's eyes.

662
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,048
Because the seed comes from him.

663
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,549
Are you kidding me?

664
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,222
I took it from him
and gave it to you,

665
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,892
and when you showed mercy,
you earned this.

666
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,848
You didn't think before shoving
some rapist's seed inside me to ask?

667
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:43,561
You gods are real shaky on the
concept of consent, you know that?

668
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,113
It doesn't matter
where it comes from.

669
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,691
It matters what you do with it.

670
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,492
I don't want it.

671
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,491
I don't accept it.

672
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,244
Do you think the chosen
want to be chosen?

673
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,202
I don't want a molecule
of his power.

674
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,207
It's not his anymore.

675
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,755
It's yours.

676
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,926
This might sound horrible,
but he's gone.

677
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,885
Does it matter
where it came from?

678
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,221
It's magic.

679
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,601
You sound like her.

680
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,308
Yeah, well, maybe she's right.

681
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,522
You don't understand.

682
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,194
No, I don't.

683
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,273
I'd do anything to get it back.

684
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,863
If I could give it to you,
I would.

685
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,746
What if you could?

686
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,801
Kady, have a seat, please.

687
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,970
Actually, I need to sign out.

688
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,260
Yes, well,
let's talk about that.

689
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,184
No offense, but we just did.

690
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,603
So, if there's something
for me to sign or...

691
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,648
Kady, you are a danger
to yourself and to others.

692
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,566
<i>You say "I love you,"</i>

693
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,985
<i>I swear to God,
I will find a way to kill you.</i>

694
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,654
<i>At least then,
this would be over.</i>

695
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,157
So who do you think
you're talking to?

696
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,905
Who did you want to kill?

697
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,659
This is not something
you'll understand.

698
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,287
Kady, we're going to give you
a light sedative.

699
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,492
Bob...

700
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,170
Move.

701
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,709
Kady!

702
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,341
Code gray.

703
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,601
No, no, no!

704
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,848
No, God damn it!

705
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:41,939
You can't do this!

706
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,023
No!

707
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,900
Well...

708
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,318
You guys got to loop
out of your shitty past.

709
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,237
Looks like I'm stuck with mine.

710
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,785
We are not leaving you
alone with this.

711
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,120
There's the old
ball and chain now.

712
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,542
I better catch some rest

713
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,711
before he wakes up with a boner

714
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,130
and some bad, bad ideas.

715
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,090
- Déjà vu.
- Peaches and...

716
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,140
Peaches and plums.
Peaches and plums.

717
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,811
I got so old.

718
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,023
You died.

719
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,487
I died.

720
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,994
You had a wife.

721
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,334
And we had a family.

722
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,420
How... How...

723
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,960
How do we remember that?

724
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,138
I don't know.
