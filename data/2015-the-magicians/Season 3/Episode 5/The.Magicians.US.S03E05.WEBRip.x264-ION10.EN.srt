1
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:06,574
.

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,443
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,312
- I wouldn't. Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,147
- This is Jane Chatwin,
all grown up.

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,149
We know about the time loops
that you keep making.

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,386
- As you should by now.
- Prince Ess of Loria.

7
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,688
- I like you.

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,691
- Tick, you're going to go
to that fairy repellent hallway

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,560
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

10
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,130
You're gonna put it
in the fairy queen's bath.

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,132
I'm gonna cut out her heart
and eat it.

12
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,334
- No, come on, Penny.
Don't--don't--Come on.

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,136
- I was astral projecting.

14
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,537
I wasn't in my body
when I died.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,372
- Thank you.

16
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,241
You're missing
the signs, Julia.

17
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,376
- Help her, now.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,514
- Jesus.

19
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,715
- Kady!

20
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,584
*

21
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,154
- We've been--we've been
calling it the Truth Key,

22
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,688
'cause it--well,
it reveals truths.

23
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,158
- Mm, I can handle
a little truth.

24
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,327
Oh, hey, Penny.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,528
- Wai--

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,368
- Hi.

27
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,602
I was just leaving.

28
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,304
- Okay.

29
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,673
Oh, hey, wait.
I, um...

30
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,211
Um...

31
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:18,612
- Um, don't talk shit
on Penny.

32
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,682
He's--he's here.
He's coming with me.

33
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,217
- Oh. Okay.

34
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,553
Um, hi, Penny.

35
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,756
Right, sorry.
Um...

36
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:33,227
You heard
about Brakebills, right?

37
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,329
Well, it turns out,
the Physical Cottage

38
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:38,266
has been, like,
magically moved so many times

39
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,468
that, uh, there's
no valid deed on it,

40
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,271
so, like, you can't sell
something that you don't own,

41
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,173
so we can, um...

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,642
- Um, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,244
I'm sor--sorry.

44
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,645
I'm not trying
to make it weird.

45
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,381
It's just weird now.

46
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,616
It just is.
It's just weird.

47
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,418
Sorry.

48
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,653
So I'm going to take the key
so I can see Penny,

49
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,622
and I'll bring it back.

50
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,756
Okay.

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,459
- You guys have fun.
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:18,306
- Sorry.
I thought you went to rehab.

53
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,740
- Uh, this is where
they stick you

54
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,409
when you don't have insurance.

55
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,543
- Oh.

56
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,714
I'm the least crazy person
in here.

57
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,551
What do you want?

58
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,823
- Hold this.

59
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,371
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,506
No. No, no, no, wait!

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,308
- You just need to hold this.

62
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,847
*

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,415
- Oh, my God.

64
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:07,321
*

65
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,457
- I'm Just gonna give
you two a moment.

66
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,625
- Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

67
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,864
[woman speaking indistinctly
over PA]

68
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,699
- Look, I know
it's weird,

69
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,734
but at least I'm not stuck
in the fucking Underworld

70
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,570
for a billion years.

71
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,606
- Why are you acting
like this is good news?

72
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,541
- Because...

73
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,742
I'm not dead.

74
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,545
- Yeah, well,
I almost was.

75
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,347
Look--look at me.

76
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,515
Look at where I am.

77
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,783
- I know.

78
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,751
And I'm sorry.

79
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,620
- I tried to save you,

80
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,888
and I failed,

81
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,491
and it broke me,

82
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,294
and now--
now you're--you're--

83
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:51,432
You're--you're what--
some kind of ghost?

84
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,766
- Astral projection.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,602
- What's the fucking
difference?

86
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,370
I-I can't--I can't touch you.

87
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,905
I can't even see you
without holding a key

88
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,873
that makes me physically ill.

89
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,675
I can't...

90
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,513
I...

91
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,915
- Look, I'm here.
That's all.

92
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,752
- Let me help you.

93
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,625
How are you gonna help me?

94
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,527
Huh?

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,862
You're the reason
I'm in here, Penny.

96
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,632
Don't you fucking get that?

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,736
No, I have to put myself
back together.

98
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,571
- Yeah, but, Kady, I--
- No.

99
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,940
If you say "I love you,"
I swear to God,

100
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,943
I will find a way to kill you.

101
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,712
At least then,
this would be over.

102
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,529
- Whatever happens,

103
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,932
remind me never to take
your advice again.

104
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,335
Let's go.

105
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,941
- I'm sorry. You sent
Fen and Fray into the City?

106
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,543
They're gonna get eaten alive.

107
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,445
She is
a knife maker's daughter.

108
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,980
She can handle herself.

109
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,882
Besides, I sent them with Todd,

110
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,585
so it's not like
I'm completely irresponsible.

111
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,487
Look, if you really want
to talk about this

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,855
instead of getting over Alice,
then we can, but...

113
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,725
I'm sorry.
Look...

114
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,461
I know that it's all shitty
right now, but--

115
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,863
- At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

116
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,765
- Mm.

117
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,502
And when we do,
maybe Alice will act

118
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,736
like someone I recognize.

119
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,471
- On the plus,
you didn't exaggerate.

120
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,740
This book is
strangely compelling,

121
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,642
yet incomplete.

122
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,012
- Yeah, it's
a one-step-at-a-time quest.

123
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,647
Um...

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,650
Okay, so the chapter, right?

125
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,819
It's about
the Daughter's training

126
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,454
to become a knight, right?

127
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,955
And it is--
it's sort of fascinating

128
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:58,426
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

129
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,994
- Right. Cute.
Where do we get the key?

130
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,864
- Um...

131
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,032
Right here.

132
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,734
- Mm.

133
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,768
Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,438
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,605
- It's the Mosaic.

136
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,008
- The Mosaic.

137
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,511
The puzzle.
- Nope.

138
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,046
- It's...

139
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,748
You use tiles...

140
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,015
Are you kidding me?

141
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,917
You use the tiles
to create a design

142
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,786
that reflects the beauty
of all life,

143
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,955
and when you do,
there's a-a mystery prize.

144
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,790
You've--really,
you've never heard of this?

145
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,662
Sounds appropriately vague
and impossible.

146
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,864
What's the prize?

147
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,067
- A so-called key
to greater magic.

148
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,969
Don't you love it
when the metaphors

149
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,070
turn out to be literal?

150
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,071
Let's go.

151
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,974
- El, it's in Fillory.

152
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,944
- Psst!

153
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,580
You look nervous.

154
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,683
Why would I be nervous?

155
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,485
I only collected a substance

156
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,087
I must assume the fairy queen
would kill me for having--

157
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,589
- Shh.

158
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,991
Ovary up, Tick.

159
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,627
Let me see the jar.

160
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,698
- Having scraped
from the very walls

161
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,566
she is violently allergic to.

162
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,968
- Nicely done.
We need more.

163
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,837
- This took me seven hours.

164
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,939
- So seven more hours
should be easy.

165
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,609
We only get one shot
to slip this in her bath.

166
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,711
- High Queen Margo.

167
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,078
Join me, won't you?

168
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,052
- All right.
You want to tell me

169
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,755
what the fuck is going on here?

170
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,924
- A leader as brave and cunning
as yourself

171
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:41,128
knows that she needs alliances
in order to grow her kingdom.

172
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,098
- Consider this
a wedding gift.

173
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,139
Well, don't just stand there.

174
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,075
You've got to get ready
for your guests.

175
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,580
- Oh, fucking balls.

176
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:12,125
*

177
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,029
On Earth, we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first,

178
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,031
or at least know
where they come from.

179
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,734
- Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

180
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,135
- I mean, vaguely.

181
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,104
I was told they're marauding
dickholes who steal stuff.

182
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,140
- Well, thanks to the loss of
magic, their mountain crashed

183
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,943
and is now an island
off your coast.

184
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,045
Their army, however,

185
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,583
numbers 4,000 spears.

186
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,084
Marry into the tribe,
it's yours.

187
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,789
Look, somebody already
tried to trick me

188
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,191
into the whole
"alliance by wedding" thing.

189
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,726
I passed.

190
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,796
- You had a choice back then.

191
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:49,997
Being a queen

192
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,801
means sacrificing
for your people.

193
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,703
Get used to it.

194
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,672
- Do you want to enlighten me
as to why you give a queef

195
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,073
whether I marry
some mountain turd or not?

196
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,009
- No, I don't.

197
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,110
- High Queen Margo.

198
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,845
- Jesus.

199
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,680
You scared me.

200
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:07,948
- Were you talking
to someone?

201
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,818
- No, I just didn't expect
to see you there.

202
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,686
- True.

203
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,723
Haven't seen you since...

204
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,090
After our own
little near-miss,

205
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,992
I'm a little surprised
to see you running off

206
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,228
to the altar so soon.
- I hear you there.

207
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,130
- I mean,
The Floating Mountain?

208
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,766
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

209
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,636
- They have a real big army.

210
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:32,706
- Well, whatever you plan on
doing with all that manpower,

211
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,242
I certainly hope it doesn't put
us on opposite sides.

212
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,746
- High King Eliot and your dad
forged an alliance.

213
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,213
Nothing's changed.

214
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,017
- Is this about the time
that we banged

215
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,920
and then I opted
out of marrying you?

216
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,657
Your insecurity
is showing, babe.

217
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,959
- That was purely political.

218
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,962
But if we'd had
another round,

219
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,865
I'm certain my charms
would lead you to reconsider...

220
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,833
my queen.

221
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,635
I look forward
to our future talks.

222
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,012
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

223
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,847
and taken it upon themselves

224
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:18,185
to set up camp
in your very favorite hallway.

225
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,887
I fear there is no way

226
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,221
to complete the task
we discussed.

227
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,191
- Shit.

228
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,794
We have to figure out
another weapon.

229
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,161
In the meantime,

230
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:31,198
I need the fastest bunnies
you got.

231
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,167
- So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

232
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,836
or was.

233
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,871
Um, so I figured, you know,
stick the key in...

234
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,073
- Mm.
- Wind it, and...

235
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,743
- Logical.
- Right.

236
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,977
Except that
there is not a--

237
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,813
you know,
there's no keyhole anywhere.

238
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,715
- It's chain-wound.

239
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,182
- I took an elective
in Horomancy.

240
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,985
- At castle.
Getting married.

241
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,321
- Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

242
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,323
- At castle.
Getting married.

243
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,958
- Does that sound
like Margo to you?

244
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,092
- Uh...

245
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,861
- Need help
now, dickwads.

246
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,095
- Definitely Bambi.

247
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,064
Okay, we have to find a way
to get there.

248
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,033
Um, uh, do you think
that the key

249
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,935
can create a portal
to Fillory somehow?

250
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,237
- Eliot, look.
- Oh.

251
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,740
I guess this is my cue.

252
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:23,050
*

253
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,823
*

254
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,224
- Okay...

255
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:35,863
*

256
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,264
Okay.

257
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,133
Well, we should wait
and gather the troops, right?

258
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,369
*

259
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,071
- Go time.

260
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,306
Guess this leg of the quest
is you and me.

261
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,911
*

262
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,379
- Okay.

263
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:58,752
*

264
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,389
Okay, well, I hope that was
the right choice,

265
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,258
'cause the portal just closed.

266
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,398
- Yeah.

267
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,967
Whoa.

268
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:14,968
Oh, my God.

269
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,303
Magic.

270
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,006
- Magic. Ha!
- Eliot.

271
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,908
- They...

272
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,979
- It's not back.

273
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,181
- Um, is that...

274
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,151
- They're constructing
the north spire.

275
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,886
- Which was built in, uh...

276
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,387
- Decades before
the Chatwins arrived.

277
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,290
We're...

278
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,927
in Fillory in the past.

279
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,896
*

280
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,000
.

281
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,936
- So, in the Fillory books,

282
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,403
Jane, um,

283
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,205
she decides to try
the Mosaic, right?

284
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,506
Uh, but she's too late.

285
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,409
Someone had already
solved it first.

286
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,447
- Well, I don't know,
but maybe it's us,

287
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,382
and that's why
we're here now.

288
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,451
- I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

289
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,920
when I'm on a good deal
of peyote.

290
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,995
Hmm...

291
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,596
Yoo-hoo.

292
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,966
Hiya.

293
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,372
It's all yours...

294
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,976
if you don't mind wasting
your gods-damn time.

295
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,615
- Oh. Well...

296
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,919
auspicious signs abound.

297
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,353
*

298
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,354
Ay.

299
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:45,292
*

300
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,996
- All right, so 784 tiles
in 15 colors.

301
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,032
Uh, so that's 784 factorial,

302
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,366
uh, divided by...

303
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,636
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

304
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,606
- Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

305
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,876
There's a finite set
of possible solutions, so...

306
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,914
Um...

307
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,349
Okay, yeah,
that's a lot of zeroes.

308
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,520
- Yeah.

309
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,055
A shitload.

310
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,992
- The mother of your
soon-to-be prince consort

311
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,360
wishes to meet with you.

312
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,095
- Yeah, thanks.
Not in the mood.

313
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,496
- May I present,

314
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,498
from the Tribe
of The Floating Mountain

315
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,000
That Is No Longer Floating,

316
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,469
Lady Agate Grey
the Stone Queen?

317
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,638
- Greetings, High Queen Margo.

318
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,374
- Um, hey, Stone Queen.

319
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,676
I'm actually glad you're here.

320
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,014
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

321
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,515
- Well, I was led to believe

322
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,984
this was a matter
of some urgency.

323
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,586
- And who led you
to believe that?

324
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,322
- A mutual royal friend.

325
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,623
Very pale.

326
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,660
- Look, I'm sure your armies
are super great.

327
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,062
It's just...

328
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,396
- My own wedding
was so long ago,

329
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,331
I forget how nervous
a bride can be.

330
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,034
- Perhaps we forego
superstition

331
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,704
and let you meet my son
before the ceremony.

332
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,140
Unless you think
that's too forward?

333
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,608
- Fine.

334
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,043
I'd love to meet the man

335
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,644
I'm gonna marry
in a couple hours.

336
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,946
- Wonderful.

337
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,315
Invite the rest in.

338
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,152
Oh, stand up straight, darling.

339
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,955
May I present
Prince Fomar.

340
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,390
- Okay, no.

341
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,559
Uh-huh.
Too freaky, even for me.

342
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,695
- Oh, no, Your Highness,
of course not.

343
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,063
Fomar is far too young.

344
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,398
- Mother.

345
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,968
- A pebble's time
will come, dear.

346
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,170
Fomar will be
your brother-in-law.

347
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,471
Ah.

348
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:42,375
Your betrothed...

349
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,144
Prince Micah.

350
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:49,049
- Greetings, my queen.

351
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,151
May our great mountain

352
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,553
find its way
through your fertile valley.

353
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,160
- Hello, Prince Micah.

354
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,630
- Why don't you two
take a moment

355
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,499
to get to know
each other... alone?

356
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,370
Let's go. Come on.

357
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,642
- How can I make this right
for you, my queen?

358
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,111
- Are you one of those
sick fuck princes

359
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,746
who likes to shoot girls
with arrows,

360
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,715
or am I gonna wake up tomorrow
chained to a wall?

361
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:26,219
- If you are, I will free you,
if you command.

362
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,088
You are a woman.

363
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,223
- Okay.

364
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:34,494
Since you mention women,
let's discuss.

365
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,563
- Our women are leaders.

366
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,765
They are the cave,
full of wisdom.

367
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,701
Men are the boulder,
full of strength.

368
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,770
The spear with the boulder...

369
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,238
Yeah, okay.

370
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,639
I get the idea.

371
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,542
So, matriarchy, huh?

372
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:55,582
Society where women
hold the primary power.

373
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,750
- Is that not the way it is
everywhere, my queen?

374
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,154
- It is.

375
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,791
I still don't understand
why we have to do this

376
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,793
in the same room.

377
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:11,064
- It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

378
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,282
*

379
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,652
*

380
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,287
- Oh, my queen.

381
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,189
*

382
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,191
I am unharmed,
and you?

383
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,726
- I'm good.

384
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,563
*

385
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,698
Um, one sec, okay?

386
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,733
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:49,502
.

388
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,172
- Are you seriously accusing me
of trying to kill Micah?

389
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:53,773
Why in Loria's name
would I do that?

390
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,843
- I don't know.
Why would you?

391
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,511
- You know, you didn't seem
all that excited

392
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,380
about the wedding yourself
last time we talked.

393
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,483
- Are you suggesting
I did it?

394
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,452
Is your war council
getting afraid

395
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,487
of our alliance
with the Floaters?

396
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,422
- You told me
we had nothing to fear.

397
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,624
- And you told me
you'd win me with charm.

398
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,393
- If I'd actually tried to kill
that walking jawline,

399
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,128
he'd be dead.

400
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,896
- It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

401
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,598
and tried to kill someone
to get your way.

402
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,899
- Spoken like someone

403
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,369
who's really starting
to miss me.

404
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,436
- Honey...

405
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,173
you ain't even top 50,

406
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,275
and you ain't getting
another chance

407
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,210
to kill my husband.

408
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,445
Guards!

409
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,881
Lock him up.

410
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,583
And be a little rough about it.

411
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,420
*

412
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,300
- Yeah, they're still
not moving, Q.

413
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,935
- Son of a...

414
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,337
I checked...

415
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,273
Look, I've checked
the Circumstances,

416
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,441
and the Slavic is perfect.

417
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,675
It should work.
I don't...

418
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,944
- Unless magic doesn't work
on this.

419
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,314
- Great. Brought back to a time
when magic exists

420
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,915
except on the one thing
that we need it to.

421
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,417
- Okay, okay, so--
so what?

422
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,584
We do it the old-fashioned way.

423
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,952
We're smart.
We can do hard things.

424
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,288
- This is
an impossible thing, Eliot.

425
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,224
- We have to show
the beauty of all life.

426
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,325
- Yeah.

427
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,626
- What does that mean,

428
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,461
and how are we supposed
to show it with tiles?

429
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,230
- We're not gonna show it with
fucking math, Quentin!

430
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,465
- This is the stupidest puzzle!
- No, no, no.

431
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,668
- I...
- This is our quest.

432
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,438
We have to do it ourselves.

433
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,211
I'm not saying that it's not
going to take a while.

434
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,614
Logic this with me
for one second, okay?

435
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,982
Hmm?

436
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,552
Jane came along
too late, right?

437
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,321
Someone came to the Mosaic
and solved it

438
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,589
before she even got here--

439
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,591
gets here--
will get here.

440
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,294
You tried to convince me
that someone was us.

441
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,928
Hmm?

442
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,497
- Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

443
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,499
- Well, in the absence
of a better option,

444
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,268
let's--let's
at least try, huh?

445
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,009
- He needed some time
to himself.

446
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,614
- Uh, I've just been
trying to figure out this thing

447
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,283
that Penny told me--

448
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,451
uh, something that he saw
in the astral plane.

449
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,688
- These aren't magic.
These are religion.

450
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,423
- Yeah.

451
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,258
We're in that territory.

452
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,431
*

453
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,766
- Alice needs your help.

454
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:41,541
*

455
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,410
- Help her, Julia.

456
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:47,447
*

457
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,552
What the fuck?

458
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,457
Okay.

459
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,694
Let's go get a drink.
Yeah?

460
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:12,004
*

461
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,741
- Everyone, gather around.

462
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,545
Greetings, Fillorians,
Floaters.

463
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,348
We gather to join
two great lands.

464
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,729
High Queen Margo,

465
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,631
do you take Micah

466
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,634
of the Tribe of
The Floating Mountain...

467
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,736
That Is No Longer Floating

468
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,438
to be yours,

469
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,475
binding your houses together
for eternity?

470
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,079
Traditional Earth saying.

471
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,649
- Prince Micah,

472
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,852
do you take Margo
of the Tribe of Hanson

473
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,588
to be yours,

474
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:05,124
binding your houses together
for eternity?

475
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,727
- I do.

476
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:18,337
*

477
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,113
- When the rock
crumbles in our hand,

478
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,882
we must reach for the next.

479
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,085
Pickwick, continue, per custom.

480
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,523
- Yes, yes, of course,
you're right.

481
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,661
What are you talking about?

482
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,162
What custom?

483
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,099
- Uh, when tragedy befalls
a royal wedding,

484
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,636
it is the solemn duty
of the surviving sibling

485
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,703
to carry out--

486
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,406
- It is my duty

487
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,541
and honor

488
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,909
to take the place of my...

489
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,712
late brother.

490
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:03,149
- But he--he
fucking killed him.

491
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,917
He murdered his own brother!

492
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,719
- That does not affect my duty.

493
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,422
*

494
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,127
*

495
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,530
- Marry him...

496
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,898
now.

497
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:28,608
.

498
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,916
God damn it!

499
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,852
I'm done.

500
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,488
- Okay.

501
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:44,924
Just don't take it apart
until I write it down.

502
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,859
- Okay.

503
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,871
- God damn it.

504
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,907
- I'll write it down.

505
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,610
- Okay, yeah, so you just
fill in--

506
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,579
fill that in with red.
- Oh, my God.

507
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,481
You know, you're not going
to get very far

508
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,650
if you're this frustrated
after 14 days.

509
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,486
- Oh, Q.

510
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,488
You know the answer.

511
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:18,725
Can you imagine Margo
putting up with this tedium?

512
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,494
- No, not even a little.

513
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,796
- She'd have blown it up
day two.

514
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,532
What is that, anyway?

515
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,766
- You know, not everything

516
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,668
has to look
like something, Eliot.

517
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,737
- Ah, it's
the eternal argument.

518
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,574
Realism versus
abstract expressionism.

519
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,042
Mm, okay.

520
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,044
Green.

521
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,512
Green.

522
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,548
- Yeah.
- Yeah, green one.

523
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,815
There.

524
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,050
No, no, there.

525
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,585
- No.

526
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,886
There.

527
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,821
Just kidding. You had it right
the first time.

528
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,690
I'll tell you
where I'll put this.

529
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,958
Come at me, Coldwater.

530
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,827
Plums?

531
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:55,862
Arielle.

532
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:56,929
- I'm Eliot.

533
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:57,930
This is my friend, Quentin.

534
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,599
- Hi, there.

535
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:00,733
- Hi.

536
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,835
Oh, this is my helper, Lunk.

537
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,540
*

538
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:08,975
- Happy anniversary, Q.

539
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,011
To our first and last year
at this thing.

540
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,982
*

541
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,785
Mm.

542
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,687
- Hey.
- Hey.

543
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,954
- I, um...

544
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,959
*

545
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,661
Um, so...

546
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:29,829
- Yeah.

547
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,565
Um...

548
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,734
let's just save our
overthinking

549
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,336
for the puzzle, yeah?

550
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,838
- Yeah.

551
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,108
- * Being him
is who you are *

552
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,976
*

553
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,113
* Lay her
in her lover's arms *

554
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,915
- We could be done tomorrow
for all you know.

555
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,817
- * He will never know...

556
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,019
- We can't just throw away
all this time we've invested.

557
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,955
You want to live your life,
live it here.

558
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,624
- What is that supposed
to mean?

559
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,726
- You know exactly
what that means.

560
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,995
- * And she will never
know why *

561
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,364
*

562
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,999
- Oops.

563
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,902
I don't know.
It's just...

564
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,704
*

565
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,073
Hey.
- Hey.

566
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,742
*

567
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,012
- Found him holding
someone else's peaches.

568
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,148
*

569
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,785
- Sorry, I, um...

570
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,054
I mean, I always thought you
were too good for him anyway.

571
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,057
- * These young bodies turn

572
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,159
* Evolve on a word

573
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,894
* You found in my...

574
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,731
*

575
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,868
* It's all that I find

576
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:45,171
* And if you wanna sell
your body *

577
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,807
* There's a war to side

578
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,178
* I don't wanna say
what I want first *

579
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,181
* In the middle
of your desert *

580
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,817
* Where I only made it worse

581
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,955
* Would I light them up
and know that it's done? *

582
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:06,158
* There's a bottle
full of water *

583
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,961
* I've been turning
on its side *

584
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:11,931
* I don't mind
if I don't find *

585
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,767
* Where it's been running
all this time *

586
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,670
* I don't mind
if I don't see it... *

587
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,138
- Come visit soon.

588
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,439
- Of course.

589
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,908
- * I don't mind...

590
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,175
- If we're not here--
- I know, Dad.

591
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,745
- * I don't know what to say

592
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,179
- I love you, too.

593
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:34,386
*

594
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,433
- No, um...

595
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,801
our friends...

596
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,870
*

597
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,438
Uh, from our lives before.

598
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:55,041
*

599
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,943
- I dream about them
sometimes.

600
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,711
- Hmm.

601
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:05,417
*

602
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:15,862
- Eliot...

603
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:22,902
*

604
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:47,927
*

605
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,147
- Did you just solve
the Mosaic?

606
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:47,186
*

607
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,955
- With a friend.

608
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,190
*

609
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,960
We solved it together.

610
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,261
- Well, this is dreadful!

611
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,129
You see--

612
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,198
Sorry, I don't mean
to be rude.

613
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,101
My name is--
- Jane Chatwin.

614
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,237
You do look...

615
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,206
- Ah, just one of those faces.

616
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,975
- The dwarves...

617
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:12,111
They built me this watch.

618
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,947
It's terribly important.

619
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:17,116
I need that key
to power it.

620
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,254
- It sort of took us
a while to, um...

621
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,123
- It's just...

622
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,258
My brother, he's...

623
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,127
he's become dangerous,

624
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,262
and I'm trying to stop him.

625
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,998
The dwarves told me

626
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,300
if everything gets
too buggered up to fix,

627
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,168
I could use this watch.

628
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,171
- To create time loops.

629
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:42,008
You need the key
to stop The Beast.

630
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,947
- Unfortunately,
you'll find out.

631
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,384
Mm...

632
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,854
Uh...

633
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,361
You have to take it.

634
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,198
Here.

635
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,904
Thank you.

636
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,135
.

637
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,570
- My queen,

638
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,572
time to complete our marriage.

639
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,608
We must become one flesh.

640
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,443
Right?
- I told you--

641
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,245
it's Earth tradition.

642
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,481
- But must you really open
every present

643
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,216
before we can consummate?

644
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,618
- Well, if I don't...

645
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,289
your manhood will rot
and drop off

646
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,491
like an overripe banana.

647
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,326
- Better not to chance it.

648
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,527
- Don't wait up.

649
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,119
- So I arranged for this
to be delivered

650
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,187
the day of your wedding,

651
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,156
way, way in advance.

652
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,257
Long story.

653
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,392
Anyway, I hope you're okay.

654
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,628
No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

655
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,065
Eliot and I are both dead.

656
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,134
Uh, the quest sent us

657
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,069
to the past--
again, super-long story--

658
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:55,307
and you should know
that we led full, good lives,

659
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:59,678
and we took the quest
as far as we could, and...

660
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,381
now there's something
that we need you to do.

661
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,220
*

662
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,595
- Hello, Margo.

663
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,397
- Hi.

664
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,631
Didn't you die?

665
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,600
On the linear plane, yes.

666
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,602
Not here, in the Clock Barrens.

667
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,304
- Right.

668
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,307
So some kind of timey-wimey
magic going on here.

669
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,409
- Time loops are not
my only trick.

670
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,111
Here I managed to
create a spot

671
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,712
where all moments exist
at the same time,

672
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,148
overlapping.

673
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,583
- So, even if you're dead...

674
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,351
- You're alive here.

675
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,387
And dead, too, I suppose.

676
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,322
This is a place
outside of time.

677
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,191
- Well, I got a note
from Quentin.

678
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,525
He told me
you could give me a key.

679
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,160
- Yes.

680
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,496
The key is here,
but I can't give it to you.

681
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,498
It's what keeps
the Clock Barrens stable.

682
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,200
That said, I would like
to help you, Margo.

683
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:57,203
- I don't need help.
I need the key.

684
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,471
Now, I'm sorry, but I've had
a bad couple of days,

685
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,340
and my best friends are dead,

686
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,543
and, frankly, I wish I had
your magic, or any magic,

687
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,645
'cause I'd like to build
my own Clock Barrens

688
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:10,249
right about now
and just live there

689
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:13,219
for, like, five minutes
without anyone trying to usurp

690
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,354
or marry or educate
or hump me.

691
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,190
It is exhausting.

692
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,260
- You're going to be
a very, very powerful magician

693
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,628
and queen.

694
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:26,232
- Well, it doesn't feel
that way.

695
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,534
Eliot and Quentin
make all the real moves.

696
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,237
I'm more of a Fillorian
middle manager.

697
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,339
I know how that feels.

698
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,274
Sometimes like you're
a supporting player

699
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,243
in somebody else's story.

700
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,478
Your tale is your own, Margo.

701
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,646
You may not get

702
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,514
the appreciation
you deserve, frankly,

703
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,350
or the peace,

704
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:45,751
but it is yours,

705
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,387
and I can tell you,
it won't be boring.

706
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,391
- Thank you.

707
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,426
- Now, as to how I can help--

708
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,195
out there
in the linear plane,

709
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,763
the key rests on my body
at Brakebills.

710
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,698
I can send you there,
no problem.

711
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,667
- You're telling me
to dig up your corpse.

712
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,535
How the hell can you be
so chipper about it?

713
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,504
- Eh, hasn't happened yet.

714
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:08,274
And I'm very English.

715
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,277
It's been so good
to chat to you, Margo.

716
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,279
Ready to go?

717
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,380
- Yeah.

718
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,317
- I guess this is my cue.

719
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,388
*

720
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,323
- Wait!

721
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,824
You bitches looking for these?

722
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,559
*

723
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,264
Fuck.

724
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,399
That entrance line was

725
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,600
the only thing
keeping me going

726
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,302
through six feet of dirt
and corpse.

727
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:37,769
- Bambi. Hey.

728
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,639
- And I swore
I wouldn't do this.

729
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,844
- Wow.

730
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,846
I mean, I can't believe
we died.

731
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,847
Sort of weird.

732
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,382
Sad, right?

733
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,683
- But we didn't die.

734
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,285
It was an alternate timeline

735
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,521
and one that we never have
to live now.

736
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,389
Margo, you saved our lives.

737
00:35:57,423 --> 00:36:01,393
- In addition to robbing
the cradle and a grave.

738
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,762
I'll never get that smell
out of my hair.

739
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,335
- I mean, I know who I was.

740
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,303
I was Alice Quinn.

741
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,539
I was the best at something,

742
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,274
at magic,

743
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:18,310
but then magic took over,
and I lost Alice,

744
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,412
and by the time I got her back,
I lost magic.

745
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:26,618
- I could use magic,
and you have it.

746
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,820
Why do you have it?
- Mm.

747
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,656
Prevailing theory?

748
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,659
Extra sprinkles on the cupcake
from when Our Lady Underground

749
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,695
restored my Shade, but...

750
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,531
she didn't exactly
leave a note, so...

751
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,600
- So you don't know.

752
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,537
- Yes.

753
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,539
I mean, if you want
to understand it,

754
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:50,409
you need to know.

755
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,745
Hey, all magic
has a provenance.

756
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:56,382
*

757
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,884
Uh, there was this machine
that the professors would use.

758
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,654
- Yeah, Q showed it to me,
but it doesn't work anymore.

759
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,524
- Right, of course not.

760
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,526
*

761
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,761
What about the key?

762
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,530
It shows the truth
of things, right?

763
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,499
Have you tried using that?

764
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,501
- I've held it.

765
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:19,605
*

766
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,807
- Maybe a mirror
could help you focus it.

767
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,379
*

768
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,780
- Yeah, okay.

769
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:35,787
*

770
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,899
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

771
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,845
- Have a seat, Julia.

772
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:06,618
.

773
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,056
- I planted a seed
for you to grow.

774
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:14,460
- Without telling me
or asking me?

775
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:17,563
- I've tried to guide you
as gently as I could.

776
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,465
- I saw his eyes.

777
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,434
I saw Reynard's eyes.

778
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,438
- Because the seed
comes from him.

779
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,575
- I took it from him
and gave it to you,

780
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:33,111
and when you showed mercy,
you earned this.

781
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,780
- You didn't think
before shoving

782
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,049
some rapist's seed
inside me to ask?

783
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:40,986
You gods are real shaky

784
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,854
on the concept of consent,
you know that?

785
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,491
- It doesn't matter
where it comes from.

786
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,959
It matters
what you do with it.

787
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,796
- I don't want it.

788
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,798
I don't accept it.

789
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,601
- Do you think the chosen
want to be chosen?

790
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:58,570
- I don't want a molecule
of his power.

791
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:00,539
- It's not his anymore.

792
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:03,008
It's yours.

793
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,882
*

794
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,884
- This might sound horrible,

795
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,152
but he's gone.

796
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,121
Does it matter
where it came from?

797
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,490
It's magic.

798
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:19,891
- You sound like her.

799
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,628
- Yeah, well,
maybe she's right.

800
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:25,564
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

801
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,500
I'd do anything
to get it back.

802
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,102
- If I could give it to you,
I would.

803
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:38,510
*

804
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,579
What if you could?

805
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,053
- Kady, have a seat, please.

806
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,657
- Actually, I need to sign out.

807
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,625
- Yes, well,
let's talk about that.

808
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,562
- No offense, but we just did.

809
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,897
So, if there's something
for me to sign or--

810
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,933
- Kady, you are a danger
to yourself and to others.

811
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,869
- You say "I love you,"

812
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,204
I swear to God,
I will find a way to kill you.

813
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,940
At least then,
this would be over.

814
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,543
- So who do you think
you're talking to?

815
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,144
Who did you want to kill?

816
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:16,948
- This is not something
you'll understand.

817
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,651
- Kady, we're going to give you
a light sedative.

818
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,487
- Bob...

819
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,954
move.

820
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,957
- Kady!

821
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,694
Code gray.

822
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,566
[man speaking indistinctly
over PA]

823
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,968
*

824
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,904
No, no, no!

825
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,105
No, God damn it!

826
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,172
You can't do this!

827
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,173
No!

828
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,178
- Well...

829
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:50,716
you guys got to loop
out of your shitty past.

830
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,619
Looks like I'm stuck with mine.

831
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:58,524
We are not leaving you
alone with this.

832
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:01,527
- There's the old
ball and chain now.

833
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,961
I better catch some rest

834
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,996
before he wakes up
with a boner

835
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,499
and some bad, bad ideas.

836
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,524
- * Being him
is who you are *

837
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,560
*

838
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:38,029
* Lay her
in her lover's arms *

839
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,531
*

840
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:43,001
* He will never know why

841
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,070
*

842
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,206
* He will never know why

843
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,041
*

844
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:53,011
* And she
will never know why *

845
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,313
- Déjà vu.
- Peaches and...

846
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,215
- Peaches and plums.
- Peaches and plums.

847
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,551
Peaches and plums.
Peaches and plums.

848
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,653
*

849
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,689
- * Being him
is who you are *

850
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:07,092
- I got so old.

851
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,061
- * Made us in a star...

852
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,262
- You died.

853
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,031
*

854
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:16,334
- * Eating us alive

855
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,169
- I died.

856
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,807
- * All these
young bodies turn *

857
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,142
- You had a wife.

858
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,678
- * You found in my mind

859
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,014
*

860
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,683
- And we had a family.

861
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:34,352
- How... how...

862
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,723
how do we remember that?

863
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,291
I don't know.

864
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:45,063
- * It's all been asked
of you now *

865
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:47,766
*

866
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,235
- I'm trying.

867
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,737
- Oh, my God.

868
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,141
- * If being him
is who you are *

869
00:42:56,174 --> 00:43:00,712
* Say it loud,
say you know you are *
