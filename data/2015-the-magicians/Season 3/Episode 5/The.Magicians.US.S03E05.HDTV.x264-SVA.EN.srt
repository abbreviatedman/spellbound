00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,373
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:04,467
I wouldn't. Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

3
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:06,115
This is Jane Chatwin, all grown up.

4
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,229
We know about the time loops
that you keep making.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,473
- As you should by now.
- Prince Ess of Loria.

6
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:14,613
I like you.

7
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:18,154
Tick, you're going to go
to that fairy repellent hallway

8
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:20,991
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

9
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,313
You're gonna put it
in the fairy queen's bath.

10
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,953
I'm gonna cut out her heart and eat it.

11
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:27,196
No, come on, Penny.
Don't... don't... Come on.

12
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:29,076
I was astral projecting.

13
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:30,934
I wasn't in my body when I died.

14
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:32,513
Thank you.

15
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,570
You're missing the signs, Julia.

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,739
Help her, now.

17
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:40,911
Jesus.

18
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,153
Kady!

19
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,123
We've been... we've been
calling it the Truth Key,

20
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,214
'cause it... well, it reveals truths.

21
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,454
Mm, I can handle a little truth.

22
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:52,875
Oh, hey, Penny.

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:54,899
Wai...

24
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,121
Hi.

25
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,032
I was just leaving.

26
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,633
Okay.

27
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:07,077
Oh, hey, wait. I, um...

28
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,445
Um...

29
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:12,948
Um, don't talk shit on Penny.

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,504
He's... he's here. He's coming with me.

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,546
Oh. Okay.

32
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,924
Um, hi, Penny.

33
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,217
Right, sorry. Um...

34
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:26,127
You heard about Brakebills, right?

35
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,094
Well, it turns out, the Physical Cottage

36
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,593
has been, like,
magically moved so many times

37
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:34,922
that, uh, there's no valid deed on it,

38
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:39,442
so, like, you can't sell something
that you don't own, so we can, um...

39
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:43,071
Um, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,853
I'm sor... sorry. I'm not
trying to make it weird.

41
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,521
It's just weird now.

42
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,792
It just is. It's just weird.

43
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,779
Sorry.

44
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,918
So I'm going to take the key so I can
see Penny, and I'll bring it back.

45
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:57,003
Okay.

46
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:59,615
- You guys have fun.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:12,632
Sorry. I thought you went to rehab.

48
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:15,368
Uh, this is where they stick you
when you don't have insurance.

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,939
The upside?

50
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,116
I'm the least crazy person in here.

51
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:25,403
What do you want?

52
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,282
Hold this.

53
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,559
Why?

54
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:44,696
Oh, my God!

55
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,679
No. No, no, no, wait!

56
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,634
You just need to hold this.

57
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,376
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,815
I'm Just gonna give you two a moment.

59
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:06,018
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

60
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:13,091
Look, I know it's weird,

61
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,160
but at least I'm not stuck
in the fucking Underworld

62
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,928
for a billion years.

63
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:19,997
Why are you acting
like this is good news?

64
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,899
Because...

65
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,168
I'm not dead.

66
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:25,903
Yeah, well, I almost was.

67
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,873
Look... look at me. Look at where I am.

68
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,208
I know.

69
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,092
And I'm sorry.

70
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,811
I tried to save you,

71
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,344
and I failed,

72
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:37,848
and it broke me,

73
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,559
and now... now you're... you're...

74
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,756
You're... you're what...
some kind of ghost?

75
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:46,942
Astral projection.

76
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:48,959
What's the fucking difference?

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,694
I-I can't... I can't touch you.

78
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:52,362
I can't even see you
without holding a key

79
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,298
that makes me physically ill.

80
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,066
I can't...

81
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,495
I...

82
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,372
Look, I'm here. That's all.

83
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,274
God, when does this end?

84
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,142
Let me help you.

85
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,982
How are you gonna help me?

86
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:16,285
You're the reason I'm in here, Penny.

87
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,997
Don't you fucking get that?

88
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,126
No, I have to put myself back together.

89
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,927
- Yeah, but, Kady, I...
- No.

90
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:27,396
If you say "I love you," I swear to God,

91
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:29,631
I will find a way to kill you.

92
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,076
At least then, this would be over.

93
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,852
Whatever happens,

94
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:53,355
remind me never to take
your advice again.

95
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,598
Let's go.

96
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,364
I'm sorry. You sent
Fen and Fray into the City?

97
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:03,865
They're gonna get eaten alive.

98
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,435
She is a knife maker's daughter.
She can handle herself.

99
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,304
Besides, I sent them with Todd,

100
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,939
so it's not like
I'm completely irresponsible.

101
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:13,808
Look, if you really want
to talk about this

102
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:16,277
instead of getting over Alice,
then we can, but...

103
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:19,113
I'm sorry. Look...

104
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,783
I know that it's all shitty
right now, but...

105
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:24,285
At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

106
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:26,154
Right?

107
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:28,822
And when we do, maybe Alice will act

108
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,123
like someone I recognize.

109
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,792
On the plus, you didn't exaggerate.

110
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,127
This book is strangely compelling,

111
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:35,996
yet incomplete.

112
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:39,466
Yeah, it's a one-step-at-a-time quest.

113
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:41,001
Um...

114
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:44,004
Okay, so the chapter, right?

115
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:46,206
It's about the Daughter's training

116
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,741
to become a knight, right?

117
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:49,375
And it is... it's sort of fascinating

118
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:52,713
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

119
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:55,415
Right. Cute. Where do we get the key?

120
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,251
Um...

121
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,485
Right here.

122
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:02,154
Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:04,724
- Familiar?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:05,925
It's the Mosaic.

125
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:07,159
What's the Mosaic?

126
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,429
The Mosaic.

127
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,831
- The puzzle.
- Nope.

128
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,499
It's...

129
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,101
You use tiles...

130
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:18,212
Are you kidding me? You use
the tiles to create a design

131
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,172
that reflects the beauty of all life,

132
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:22,374
and when you do,
there's a-a mystery prize.

133
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,176
You've... really,
you've never heard of this?

134
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:26,212
"The beauty of all life"?

135
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:29,014
Sounds appropriately vague
and impossible.

136
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,250
What's the prize?

137
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,519
A so-called key to greater magic.

138
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,388
Don't you love it when the metaphors

139
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,523
turn out to be literal? Let's go.

140
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,368
El, it's in Fillory.

141
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:45,364
Psst!

142
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,898
You look nervous.

143
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,034
Why would I be nervous?

144
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,770
I only collected a substance

145
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,538
I must assume the fairy queen
would kill me for having...

146
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,814
Shh.

147
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,986
Ovary up, Tick.

148
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,510
Let me see the jar.

149
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:06,885
Having scraped from the very walls
she is violently allergic to.

150
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:09,387
Nicely done. We need more.

151
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:11,221
This took me seven hours.

152
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,324
So seven more hours should be easy.

153
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:15,926
We only get one shot
to slip this in her bath.

154
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,061
High Queen Margo.

155
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,497
Join me, won't you?

156
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:29,106
All right. You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

157
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,308
A leader as brave and cunning
as yourself

158
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:35,578
knows that she needs alliances
in order to grow her kingdom.

159
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,939
Does she?

160
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:39,351
Consider this a wedding gift.

161
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,095
Well, don't just stand there.

162
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,302
You've got to get ready for your guests.

163
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,871
Oh, fucking balls.

164
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:06,556
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

165
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:10,446
On Earth, we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first,

166
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,448
or at least know where they come from.

167
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,050
Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

168
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,294
I mean, vaguely.

169
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:18,520
I was told they're marauding
dickholes who steal stuff.

170
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,557
Well, thanks to the loss of
magic, their mountain crashed

171
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,326
and is now an island off your coast.

172
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,462
Their army, however,

173
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,865
numbers 4,000 spears.

174
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,499
Marry into the tribe, it's yours.

175
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,137
Look, somebody already tried to trick me

176
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,639
into the whole
"alliance by wedding" thing.

177
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,867
I passed.

178
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,055
You had a choice back then.

179
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:44,533
Being a queen

180
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:47,521
means sacrificing for your people.

181
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,433
Get used to it.

182
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:52,186
Do you want to enlighten me
as to why you give a queef

183
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,489
whether I marry
some mountain turd or not?

184
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,391
No, I don't.

185
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,525
High Queen Margo.

186
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,193
Jesus.

187
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:00,995
You scared me.

188
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,329
Were you talking to someone?

189
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,165
No, I just didn't expect
to see you there.

190
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,001
True.

191
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:10,037
Haven't seen you since...

192
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:11,429
After our own little near-miss,

193
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,144
I'm a little surprised to see you
running off to the altar so soon.

194
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,675
I hear you there.

195
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,544
I mean, The Floating Mountain?

196
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:20,079
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

197
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,916
They have a real big army.

198
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:27,020
Well, whatever you plan on
doing with all that manpower,

199
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,689
I certainly hope it doesn't put
us on opposite sides.

200
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:33,059
High King Eliot and your dad
forged an alliance.

201
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:34,628
Nothing's changed.

202
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,398
Is this about the time that we banged

203
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:41,267
and then I opted out of marrying you?

204
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:43,937
Your insecurity is showing, babe.

205
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,306
That was purely political.

206
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:49,309
But if we'd had another round,

207
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:52,211
I'm certain my charms
would lead you to reconsider...

208
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,936
my queen.

209
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,983
I look forward to our future talks.

210
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:06,391
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

211
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,160
and taken it upon themselves

212
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,597
to set up camp
in your very favorite hallway.

213
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,633
I fear there is no way to
complete the task we discussed.

214
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,603
Shit.

215
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:21,106
We have to figure out another weapon.

216
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:22,574
In the meantime,

217
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:25,610
I need the fastest bunnies you got.

218
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,580
So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

219
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,147
or was.

220
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:32,260
Um, so I figured, you know,
stick the key in...

221
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:34,452
- Mm.
- Wind it, and...

222
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:35,974
- Logical.
- Right.

223
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,089
Except that there is not a...

224
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,933
you know, there's no keyhole anywhere.

225
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:41,730
- It's chain-wound.
- Huh?

226
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,593
I took an elective in Horomancy.

227
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:46,330
At castle. Getting married.

228
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,765
Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

229
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:50,767
At castle. Getting married.

230
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,303
Does that sound like Margo to you?

231
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,172
Need help now, dickwads.

232
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,474
Definitely Bambi.

233
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:58,442
Okay, we have to find a way
to get there.

234
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,377
Um, uh, do you think that the key

235
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,278
can create a portal to Fillory somehow?

236
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,648
- Eliot, look.
- Oh.

237
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:07,017
I guess this is my cue.

238
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:25,635
Okay...

239
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:31,674
Okay.

240
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:34,510
Well, we should wait
and gather the troops, right?

241
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,414
Go time.

242
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,716
Guess this leg of the quest
is you and me.

243
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,822
Okay.

244
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,831
Okay, well, I hope that was
the right choice,

245
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,642
'cause the portal just closed.

246
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,837
Do you feel that?

247
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,598
Yeah.

248
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,209
Whoa.

249
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,277
Oh, my God.

250
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:10,412
Magic.

251
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:13,347
- Magic. Ha!
- Eliot.

252
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,191
- What?
- They...

253
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,218
How is it back?

254
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:20,288
It's not back.

255
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,557
Um, is that...

256
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,526
They're constructing the north spire.

257
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,195
Which was built in, uh...

258
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,796
Decades before the Chatwins arrived.

259
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:30,571
We're...

260
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,235
in Fillory in the past.

261
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,681
Ah, shit.

262
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:44,232
So, in the Fillory books, Jane, um,

263
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,967
she decides to try the Mosaic, right?

264
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:47,369
Uh, but she's too late.

265
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,238
Someone had already solved it first.

266
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,040
Who?

267
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,275
Well, I don't know, but maybe it's us,

268
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:55,728
and that's why we're here now.

269
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,528
I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

270
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,839
when I'm on a good deal of peyote.

271
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,457
Yoo-hoo.

272
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,660
Hiya.

273
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,166
It's all yours...

274
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:22,669
if you don't mind wasting
your gods-damn time.

275
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:29,476
Oh. Well...

276
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:32,612
auspicious signs abound.

277
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:35,231
Ay.

278
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,689
All right, so 784 tiles in 15 colors.

279
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,759
Uh, so that's 784 factorial,

280
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,074
- uh, divided by...
- Seriously?

281
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:50,496
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

282
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,466
Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

283
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:56,536
There's a finite set
of possible solutions, so...

284
00:13:56,546 --> 00:14:00,606
Um...

285
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:03,142
Okay, yeah, that's a lot of zeroes.

286
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,177
Um, how many zeroes?

287
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:07,345
- Uh, to be exact?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,905
A shitload.

289
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,163
The mother of your
soon-to-be prince consort

290
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,343
wishes to meet with you.

291
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,163
Yeah, thanks. Not in the mood.

292
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:19,324
May I present, from the Tribe
of The Floating Mountain.

293
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:20,693
That Is No Longer Floating,

294
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,295
Lady Agate Grey the Stone Queen?

295
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:25,497
Greetings, High Queen Margo.

296
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,166
Um, hey, Stone Queen.

297
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:30,535
I'm actually glad you're here.

298
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:34,900
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

299
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:37,853
Well, I was led to believe this
was a matter of some urgency.

300
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:40,411
And who led you to believe that?

301
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,081
A mutual royal friend.

302
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,482
Very pale.

303
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,518
Look, I'm sure your armies
are super great.

304
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:48,536
It's just...

305
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:50,187
My own wedding was so long ago,

306
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:52,090
I forget how nervous a bride can be.

307
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:54,725
Perhaps we forego superstition

308
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:58,562
and let you meet my son
before the ceremony.

309
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:00,864
Unless you think that's too forward?

310
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:02,433
Fine.

311
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,503
I'd love to meet the man I'm
gonna marry in a couple hours.

312
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,122
Wonderful.

313
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,552
Invite the rest in.

314
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:12,876
Oh, stand up straight, darling.

315
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:15,612
May I present Prince Fomar.

316
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,180
Okay, no.

317
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,383
Uh-huh. Too freaky, even for me.

318
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:22,552
Oh, no, Your Highness, of course not.

319
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:23,754
Fomar is far too young.

320
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:24,995
Mother.

321
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:28,425
A pebble's time will come, dear.

322
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,893
Fomar will be your brother-in-law.

323
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,220
Your betrothed...

324
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,867
Prince Micah.

325
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:40,260
Greetings, my queen.

326
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,185
May our great mountain

327
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,662
find its way
through your fertile valley.

328
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,857
Hello, Prince Micah.

329
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:57,452
Why don't you two take a moment

330
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,263
to get to know each other... alone?

331
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,100
Let's go. Come on.

332
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,464
How can I make this right
for you, my queen?

333
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:11,800
Are you one of those sick fuck princes

334
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,602
who likes to shoot girls with arrows,

335
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:16,572
or am I gonna wake up tomorrow
chained to a wall?

336
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,941
If you are, I will free you,
if you command.

337
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:21,776
You are a woman.

338
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,945
Okay.

339
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:28,282
Since you mention women, let's discuss.

340
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,351
Our women are leaders.

341
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:32,620
They are the cave, full of wisdom.

342
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,523
Men are the boulder, full of strength.

343
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,625
The spear with the boulder...

344
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:38,959
Yeah, okay.

345
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,780
I get the idea.

346
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,015
So, matriarchy, huh?

347
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:49,370
Society where women
hold the primary power.

348
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,605
Is that not the way it is
everywhere, my queen?

349
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:54,816
It is.

350
00:16:56,485 --> 00:17:00,646
I still don't understand why we
have to do this in the same room.

351
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:04,726
It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

352
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:28,007
Oh, my queen.

353
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:31,878
I am unharmed, and you?

354
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,545
I'm good.

355
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,024
Um, one sec, okay?

356
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,310
Are you seriously accusing me
of trying to kill Micah?

357
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,205
Why in Loria's name would I do that?

358
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:49,865
I don't know. Why would you?

359
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,543
You know, you didn't
seem all that excited

360
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:53,713
about the wedding yourself
last time we talked.

361
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,514
Are you suggesting I did it?

362
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:58,449
Is your war council getting afraid

363
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,518
of our alliance with the Floaters?

364
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:02,420
You told me we had nothing to fear.

365
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,015
And you told me you'd win me with charm.

366
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:08,059
If I'd actually tried to kill
that walking jawline, he'd be dead.

367
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,027
It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

368
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:11,971
and tried to kill someone
to get your way.

369
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,567
Spoken like someone who's
really starting to miss me.

370
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:15,631
Honey...

371
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,102
you ain't even top 50,

372
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:23,393
and you ain't getting another
chance to kill my husband.

373
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,030
Guards!

374
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,977
Lock him up.

375
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,612
And be a little rough about it.

376
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:46,261
Yeah, they're still not moving, Q.

377
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:49,065
Son of a...

378
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:50,273
I checked...

379
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,235
Look, I've checked the Circumstances,

380
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,436
and the Slavic is perfect.

381
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:55,738
It should work. I don't...

382
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:58,074
Unless magic doesn't work on this.

383
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,275
Great. Brought back to a time
when magic exists

384
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,010
except on the one thing
that we need it to.

385
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,412
Okay, okay, so... so what?

386
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,081
We do it the old-fashioned way.
We're smart. We can do hard things.

387
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,250
This is an impossible thing, Eliot.

388
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,315
We have to show the beauty of all life.

389
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:11,807
- The beauty of all life?
- Yeah.

390
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,510
What does that mean, and how are
we supposed to show it with tiles?

391
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,273
We're not gonna show it with
fucking math, Quentin!

392
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:18,551
- This is the stupidest puzzle!
- No, no, no.

393
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,696
- I...
- This is our quest.

394
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:24,406
We have to do it ourselves.

395
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:31,139
I'm not saying that it's not
going to take a while.

396
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,642
Logic this with me for one second, okay?

397
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,546
Jane came along too late, right?

398
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:41,282
Someone came to the Mosaic and solved it

399
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,617
before she even got here...

400
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,619
gets here... will get here.

401
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:47,221
You tried to convince me
that someone was us.

402
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,556
Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

403
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:54,194
Well, in the absence of a better option,
let's... let's at least try, huh?

404
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,135
Is Penny with you?

405
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:03,137
He needed some time to himself.

406
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,505
What are you doing?

407
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:09,209
Uh, I've just been trying to figure
out this thing that Penny told me...

408
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:11,411
uh, something that he saw
in the astral plane.

409
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:14,714
These aren't magic. These are religion.

410
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:16,383
Yeah.

411
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,159
We're in that territory.

412
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,826
Alice needs your help.

413
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,327
Who are you?

414
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:36,368
Help her, Julia.

415
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,173
What the fuck?

416
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,390
Okay.

417
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,720
Let's go get a drink. Yeah?

418
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:07,766
Everyone, gather around.

419
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:11,536
Greetings, Fillorians, Floaters.

420
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,247
We gather to join two great lands.

421
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,754
High Queen Margo,

422
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:31,622
do you take Micah

423
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:34,625
of the Tribe of The Floating Mountain...

424
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:36,761
That Is No Longer Floating

425
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:38,395
to be yours,

426
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:41,431
binding your houses together
for eternity?

427
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,501
Oh, what the hell?

428
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,177
Traditional Earth saying.

429
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,640
Prince Micah,

430
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,909
do you take Margo of the Tribe of Hanson

431
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,578
to be yours,

432
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:58,248
binding your houses together
for eternity?

433
00:21:58,258 --> 00:21:59,970
I do.

434
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,452
When the rock crumbles in our hand,

435
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,936
we must reach for the next.

436
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,236
Pickwick, continue, per custom.

437
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,509
What?

438
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,477
Yes, yes, of course, you're right.

439
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:33,385
What are you talking about?

440
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,284
What custom?

441
00:22:36,294 --> 00:22:40,188
Uh, when tragedy befalls
a royal wedding,

442
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:43,944
it is the solemn duty of the
surviving sibling to carry out...

443
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,327
- What?
- It is my duty

444
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:47,494
and honor

445
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:49,964
to take the place of my...

446
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:52,700
late brother.

447
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,236
But he... he fucking killed him.

448
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:59,707
- He murdered his own brother!
- That does not affect my duty.

449
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:05,412
Are you people all crazy?

450
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,483
Marry him...

451
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:11,918
now.

452
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,440
God damn it!

453
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,368
I'm done.

454
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,937
Okay.

455
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:37,474
Just don't take it apart
until I write it down.

456
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,383
Okay.

457
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,387
God damn it.

458
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,456
I'll write it down.

459
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:56,058
Okay, yeah, so you just fill in...

460
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,028
- fill that in with red.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,896
You know, you're not going
to get very far

462
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,132
if you're this frustrated after 14 days.

463
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,199
How are you not?

464
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,901
Oh, Q.

465
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,903
You know the answer.

466
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,206
<i>Can you imagine Margo
putting up with this tedium?</i>

467
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,908
<i>No, not even a little.</i>

468
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,311
<i>She'd have blown it up day two.</i>

469
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,979
What is that, anyway?

470
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,248
You know, not everything

471
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,150
has to look like something, Eliot.

472
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,218
Ah, it's the eternal argument.

473
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,022
Realism versus abstract expressionism.

474
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,589
Mm, okay.

475
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,591
Green.

476
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:31,926
Green.

477
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,995
- Yeah.
- Yeah, green one.

478
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,329
There.

479
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,597
No, no, there.

480
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,033
- There?
- No.

481
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,183
There.

482
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,087
Just kidding. You had it right
the first time.

483
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:43,171
You know what? I'll tell you
where I'll put this.

484
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,505
Yeah? Come at me, Coldwater.

485
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:47,341
Peaches? Plums?

486
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,376
Arielle.

487
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,443
I'm Eliot.

488
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:52,046
- This is my friend, Quentin.
- Hi, there.

489
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,214
Hi.

490
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,349
Oh, this is my helper, Lunk.

491
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,521
Happy anniversary, Q.

492
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:04,558
To our first and last year
at this thing.

493
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

494
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:14,467
I, um...

495
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,107
Um, so...

496
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,309
Yeah.

497
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,977
Um...

498
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:27,214
let's just save our overthinking

499
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:29,949
for the puzzle, yeah?

500
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,318
Yeah.

501
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,524
We could be done tomorrow
for all you know.

502
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:45,564
We can't just throw away
all this time we've invested.

503
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:48,467
You want to live your life,
live it here.

504
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:50,068
What is that supposed to mean?

505
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:52,170
You know exactly what that means.

506
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,511
Oops.

507
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:02,414
I don't know. It's just...

508
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

509
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,687
No Lunk today?

510
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:12,523
Found him holding
someone else's peaches.

511
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:18,263
Sorry, I, um...

512
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,598
I mean, I always thought you
were too good for him anyway.

513
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:11,682
Come visit soon.

514
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:13,049
Of course.

515
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:15,718
- If we're not here...
- I know, Dad.

516
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:19,722
I love you, too.

517
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:35,604
You ever think about them?

518
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:36,672
My grandkids?

519
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:40,042
No, um...

520
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:41,243
our friends...

521
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:45,047
Uh, from our lives before.

522
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,417
I dream about them sometimes.

523
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,302
Eliot...

524
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,651
Did you just solve the Mosaic?

525
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,392
With a friend.

526
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:46,397
We solved it together.

527
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:47,798
Well, this is dreadful!

528
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:49,633
You see...

529
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:51,702
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude.

530
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:54,572
- My name is...
- Jane Chatwin.

531
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:56,406
Do I know you?

532
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,741
You do look...

533
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:59,710
Ah, just one of those faces.

534
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,411
The dwarves...

535
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:04,581
They built me this watch.

536
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:07,384
It's terribly important.

537
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,594
I need that key to power it.

538
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:14,757
It sort of took us a while to, um...

539
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,593
It's just...

540
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,761
My brother, he's...

541
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,597
he's become dangerous,

542
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:22,765
and I'm trying to stop him.

543
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:24,433
The dwarves told me

544
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,836
if everything gets
too buggered up to fix,

545
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:28,671
I could use this watch.

546
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:31,674
To create time loops.

547
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:34,443
You need the key to stop The Beast.

548
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:36,153
What's The Beast?

549
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,357
Unfortunately, you'll find out.

550
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,871
You have to take it.

551
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:58,675
Here.

552
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:04,305
Thank you.

553
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,383
My queen,

554
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,377
time to complete our marriage.

555
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:41,414
We must become one flesh.

556
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:43,216
- Right?
- I told you...

557
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:44,950
it's Earth tradition.

558
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,252
But must you really open every present

559
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:48,921
before we can consummate?

560
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,424
Well, if I don't...

561
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:54,993
your manhood will rot and drop off

562
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:57,262
like an overripe banana.

563
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:59,064
Better not to chance it.

564
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,464
Don't wait up.

565
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:24,789
<i>So I arranged for this to be delivered</i>

566
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,858
<i>the day of your wedding,</i>

567
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,138
<i>way, way in advance.</i>

568
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:32,129
<i>Long story. Anyway, I hope you're okay.</i>

569
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:34,431
<i>No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.</i>

570
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:37,701
<i>Eliot and I are both dead.</i>

571
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:39,803
<i>Uh, the quest sent us</i>

572
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:41,705
<i>to the past...
again, super-long story...</i>

573
00:32:41,715 --> 00:32:47,011
<i>and you should know
that we led full, good lives,</i>

574
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:51,482
<i>and we took the quest
as far as we could, and...</i>

575
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:54,117
<i>now there's something
that we need you to do.</i>

576
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,365
Hello, Margo.

577
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,133
Hi.

578
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:11,401
Didn't you die?

579
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:13,370
On the linear plane, yes.

580
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,372
Not here, in the Clock Barrens.

581
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:17,007
Right.

582
00:33:17,017 --> 00:33:20,010
So some kind of timey-wimey
magic going on here.

583
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,145
Time loops are not my only trick.

584
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:23,746
Here I managed to create a spot

585
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:25,515
where all moments exist
at the same time,

586
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,817
overlapping.

587
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:29,351
So, even if you're dead...

588
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,053
You're alive here.

589
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:33,088
And dead, too, I suppose.

590
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,024
This is a place outside of time.

591
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:38,404
Well, I got a note from Quentin.
He told me you could give me a key.

592
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:39,828
Yes.

593
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:42,231
The key is here,
but I can't give it to you.

594
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:44,233
It's what keeps
the Clock Barrens stable.

595
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,005
That said, I would like
to help you, Margo.

596
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:48,870
I don't need help. I need the key.

597
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,206
Now, I'm sorry, but I've had
a bad couple of days,

598
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:53,042
and my best friends are dead,

599
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:56,277
and, frankly, I wish I had
your magic, or any magic,

600
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:58,413
'cause I'd like to build
my own Clock Barrens

601
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:01,917
right about now and just live there

602
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:04,886
for, like, five minutes
without anyone trying to usurp

603
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:07,055
or marry or educate or hump me.

604
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:09,858
It is exhausting.

605
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:12,927
You're going to be
a very, very powerful magician

606
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:14,395
and queen.

607
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:17,898
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

608
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:20,268
Eliot and Quentin
make all the real moves.

609
00:34:20,278 --> 00:34:22,903
I'm more of a Fillorian middle manager.

610
00:34:22,913 --> 00:34:25,039
I know how that feels.

611
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:26,941
Sometimes like you're
a supporting player

612
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:28,909
in somebody else's story.

613
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,211
Your tale is your own, Margo.

614
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,412
You may not get

615
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:34,247
the appreciation you deserve, frankly,

616
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:36,049
or the peace,

617
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,551
but it is yours,

618
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:40,087
and I can tell you, it won't be boring.

619
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,091
Thank you.

620
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:46,126
Now, as to how I can help...

621
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:47,827
out there in the linear plane,

622
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,562
the key rests on my body at Brakebills.

623
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:51,465
I can send you there, no problem.

624
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:53,433
You're telling me to dig up your corpse.

625
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:55,268
How the hell can you be
so chipper about it?

626
00:34:55,278 --> 00:34:57,237
Eh, hasn't happened yet.

627
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:59,939
And I'm very English.

628
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:02,942
It's been so good to chat to you, Margo.

629
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:04,944
Ready to go?

630
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:06,078
Yeah.

631
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:09,982
I guess this is my cue.

632
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:15,988
Wait!

633
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:17,623
You bitches looking for these?

634
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,929
Fuck.

635
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:26,189
That entrance line was
the only thing keeping me going

636
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,966
through six feet of dirt and corpse.

637
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:29,535
Bambi. Hey.

638
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,378
And I swore I wouldn't do this.

639
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,643
Wow.

640
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:39,645
I mean, I can't believe we died.

641
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:42,047
- Sort of weird.
- Sad, right?

642
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,448
But we didn't die.

643
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,949
It was an alternate timeline

644
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,218
and one that we never have to live now.

645
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,054
Margo, you saved our lives.

646
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:53,058
In addition to robbing
the cradle and a grave.

647
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,527
I'll never get that smell
out of my hair.

648
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,998
I mean, I know who I was.

649
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:02,967
I was Alice Quinn.

650
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,235
I was the best at something,

651
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:06,904
at magic,

652
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,974
but then magic took over,
and I lost Alice,

653
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,076
and by the time I got her back,
I lost magic.

654
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,178
Okay, so how can I help?

655
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:18,348
I could use magic, and you have it.

656
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,584
- Why do you have it?
- Mm.

657
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,386
Prevailing theory?

658
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:25,389
Extra sprinkles on the cupcake
from when Our Lady Underground

659
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,425
restored my Shade, but...

660
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:31,227
she didn't exactly leave a note, so...

661
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:33,329
So you don't know.

662
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:35,665
I mean, do I want to know?

663
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:37,233
Yes.

664
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:39,235
I mean, if you want to understand it,

665
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:42,072
you need to know.

666
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:45,508
Hey, all magic has a provenance.

667
00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:50,679
Uh, there was this machine
that the professors would use.

668
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:54,383
Yeah, Q showed it to me,
but it doesn't work anymore.

669
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:57,220
Right, of course not.

670
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:01,524
What about the key?

671
00:37:01,534 --> 00:37:03,225
It shows the truth of things, right?

672
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:05,193
Have you tried using that?

673
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:07,195
I've held it.

674
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:13,568
Maybe a mirror could help you focus it.

675
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:20,542
Yeah, okay.

676
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:35,457
What?

677
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:39,913
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

678
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,605
Have a seat, Julia.

679
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:54,183
It's time for us to talk.

680
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,671
What did you do to me?

681
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:02,398
I planted a seed for you to grow.

682
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:05,635
Without telling me or asking me?

683
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:08,772
I've tried to guide you
as gently as I could.

684
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:10,640
I saw his eyes.

685
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,584
I saw Reynard's eyes.

686
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:17,613
Because the seed comes from him.

687
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:19,114
Are you kidding me?

688
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:20,783
I took it from him and gave it to you,

689
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:24,453
and when you showed mercy,
you earned this.

690
00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:26,054
You didn't think before shoving

691
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:29,366
some rapist's seed inside me to ask?

692
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,295
You gods are real shaky

693
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:34,129
on the concept of consent,
you know that?

694
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,665
It doesn't matter where it comes from.

695
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,268
It matters what you do with it.

696
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,070
I don't want it.

697
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,072
I don't accept it.

698
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:46,809
Do you think the chosen
want to be chosen?

699
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:49,778
I don't want a molecule of his power.

700
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,721
It's not his anymore.

701
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,316
It's yours.

702
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,158
This might sound horrible,

703
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:05,493
but he's gone.

704
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:07,462
Does it matter where it came from?

705
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,663
It's magic.

706
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:11,165
You sound like her.

707
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:13,835
Yeah, well, maybe she's right.

708
00:39:13,845 --> 00:39:16,770
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

709
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,673
I'd do anything to get it back.

710
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:22,443
If I could give it to you, I would.

711
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,760
What if you could?

712
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:39,360
Kady, have a seat, please.

713
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,863
Actually, I need to sign out.

714
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:44,831
Yes, well, let's talk about that.

715
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,734
No offense, but we just did.

716
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:50,170
So, if there's something
for me to sign or...

717
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,206
Kady, you are a danger
to yourself and to others.

718
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:55,141
<i>You say "I love you,"</i>

719
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:57,697
<i>I swear to God,
I will find a way to kill you.</i>

720
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,212
<i>At least then, this would be over.</i>

721
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:03,231
So who do you think you're talking to?

722
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:04,484
Who did you want to kill?

723
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:08,220
This is not something you'll understand.

724
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,857
Kady, we're going to give you
a light sedative.

725
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,429
Bob...

726
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,310
move.

727
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:17,204
Kady!

728
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,899
Code gray.

729
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,175
No, no, no!

730
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:31,410
No, God damn it!

731
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,511
You can't do this!

732
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:33,572
No!

733
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:38,517
Well...

734
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:41,920
you guys got to loop
out of your shitty past.

735
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,790
Looks like I'm stuck with mine.

736
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,693
We are not leaving you alone with this.

737
00:40:49,703 --> 00:40:52,696
There's the old ball and chain now.

738
00:40:52,706 --> 00:40:54,232
I better catch some rest

739
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,267
before he wakes up with a boner

740
00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:58,644
and some bad, bad ideas.

741
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,649
- Déjà vu.
- Peaches and...

742
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:48,518
- Peaches and plums.
- Peaches and plums.

743
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:50,687
Peaches and plums. Peaches and plums.

744
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:58,361
I got so old.

745
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:02,597
You died.

746
00:42:07,678 --> 00:42:09,471
I died.

747
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:15,443
You had a wife.

748
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,850
And we had a family.

749
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,686
How... how...

750
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:28,890
how do we remember that?

751
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,626
I don't know.

752
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:35,000
