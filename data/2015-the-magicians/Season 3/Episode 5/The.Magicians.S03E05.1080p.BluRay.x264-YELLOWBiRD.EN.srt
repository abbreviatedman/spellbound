1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,373
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:05,467
I wouldn't. Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:07,115
This is Jane Chatwin, all grown up.

4
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,229
We know about the time loops
that you keep making.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,473
- As you should by now.
- Prince Ess of Loria.

6
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,613
I like you.

7
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:19,154
Tick, you're going to go
to that fairy repellent hallway

8
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:21,991
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,313
You're gonna put it
in the fairy queen's bath.

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,953
I'm gonna cut out her heart and eat it.

11
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:28,196
No, come on, Penny.
Don't... don't... Come on.

12
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:30,076
I was astral projecting.

13
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,934
I wasn't in my body when I died.

14
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,513
Thank you.

15
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:35,570
You're missing the signs, Julia.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,739
Help her, now.

17
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:41,911
Jesus.

18
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,153
Kady!

19
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,123
We've been... we've been
calling it the Truth Key,

20
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,214
'cause it... well, it reveals truths.

21
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,454
Mm, I can handle a little truth.

22
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:53,875
Oh, hey, Penny.

23
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:55,899
Wai...

24
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,121
Hi.

25
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:04,032
I was just leaving.

26
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:05,633
Okay.

27
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,077
Oh, hey, wait. I, um...

28
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,445
Um...

29
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:13,948
Um, don't talk shit on Penny.

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,504
He's... he's here. He's coming with me.

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,546
Oh. Okay.

32
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:20,924
Um, hi, Penny.

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,217
Right, sorry. Um...

34
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:27,127
You heard about Brakebills, right?

35
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,094
Well, it turns out, the Physical Cottage

36
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,593
has been, like,
magically moved so many times

37
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:35,922
that, uh, there's no valid deed on it,

38
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:40,442
so, like, you can't sell something
that you don't own, so we can, um...

39
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,071
Um, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,853
I'm sor... sorry. I'm not
trying to make it weird.

41
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,521
It's just weird now.

42
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:50,792
It just is. It's just weird.

43
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,779
Sorry.

44
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,918
So I'm going to take the key so I can
see Penny, and I'll bring it back.

45
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,003
Okay.

46
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:00,615
- You guys have fun.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:13,632
Sorry. I thought you went to rehab.

48
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:16,368
Uh, this is where they stick you
when you don't have insurance.

49
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,939
The upside?

50
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,116
I'm the least crazy person in here.

51
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,403
What do you want?

52
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,282
Hold this.

53
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,559
Why?

54
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:45,696
Oh, my God!

55
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,679
No. No, no, no, wait!

56
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,634
You just need to hold this.

57
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,376
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,815
I'm Just gonna give you two a moment.

59
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:07,018
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

60
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:14,091
Look, I know it's weird,

61
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:16,160
but at least I'm not stuck
in the fucking Underworld

62
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,928
for a billion years.

63
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:20,997
Why are you acting
like this is good news?

64
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,899
Because...

65
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,168
I'm not dead.

66
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:26,903
Yeah, well, I almost was.

67
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,873
Look... look at me. Look at where I am.

68
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,208
I know.

69
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:33,092
And I'm sorry.

70
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:34,811
I tried to save you,

71
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,344
and I failed,

72
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:38,848
and it broke me,

73
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:41,559
and now... now you're... you're...

74
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,756
You're... you're what...
some kind of ghost?

75
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:47,942
Astral projection.

76
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,959
What's the fucking difference?

77
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,694
I-I can't... I can't touch you.

78
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,362
I can't even see you
without holding a key

79
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:55,298
that makes me physically ill.

80
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,066
I can't...

81
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:59,495
I...

82
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,372
Look, I'm here. That's all.

83
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,274
God, when does this end?

84
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,142
Let me help you.

85
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,982
How are you gonna help me?

86
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,285
You're the reason I'm in here, Penny.

87
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:19,997
Don't you fucking get that?

88
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:24,126
No, I have to put myself back together.

89
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:25,927
- Yeah, but, Kady, I...
- No.

90
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:28,396
If you say "I love you," I swear to God,

91
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:30,631
I will find a way to kill you.

92
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,076
At least then, this would be over.

93
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:50,852
Whatever happens,

94
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:54,355
remind me never to take
your advice again.

95
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:56,598
Let's go.

96
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,364
I'm sorry. You sent
Fen and Fray into the City?

97
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:04,865
They're gonna get eaten alive.

98
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,435
She is a knife maker's daughter.
She can handle herself.

99
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,304
Besides, I sent them with Todd,

100
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,939
so it's not like
I'm completely irresponsible.

101
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,808
Look, if you really want
to talk about this

102
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,277
instead of getting over Alice,
then we can, but...

103
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,113
I'm sorry. Look...

104
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:22,783
I know that it's all shitty
right now, but...

105
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:25,285
At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

106
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:27,154
Right?

107
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:29,822
And when we do, maybe Alice will act

108
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,123
like someone I recognize.

109
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,792
On the plus, you didn't exaggerate.

110
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,127
This book is strangely compelling,

111
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:36,996
yet incomplete.

112
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:40,466
Yeah, it's a one-step-at-a-time quest.

113
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,001
Um...

114
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,004
Okay, so the chapter, right?

115
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,206
It's about the Daughter's training

116
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,741
to become a knight, right?

117
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,375
And it is... it's sort of fascinating

118
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:53,713
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

119
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:56,415
Right. Cute. Where do we get the key?

120
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:59,251
Um...

121
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,485
Right here.

122
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,154
Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,724
- Familiar?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:06,925
It's the Mosaic.

125
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,159
What's the Mosaic?

126
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,429
The Mosaic.

127
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,831
- The puzzle.
- Nope.

128
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,499
It's...

129
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,101
You use tiles...

130
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:19,212
Are you kidding me? You use
the tiles to create a design

131
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:21,172
that reflects the beauty of all life,

132
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,374
and when you do,
there's a-a mystery prize.

133
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,176
You've... really,
you've never heard of this?

134
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,212
"The beauty of all life"?

135
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,014
Sounds appropriately vague
and impossible.

136
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,250
What's the prize?

137
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,519
A so-called key to greater magic.

138
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,388
Don't you love it when the metaphors

139
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,523
turn out to be literal? Let's go.

140
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,368
El, it's in Fillory.

141
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,364
Psst!

142
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:47,898
You look nervous.

143
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,034
Why would I be nervous?

144
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,770
I only collected a substance

145
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,538
I must assume the fairy queen
would kill me for having...

146
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,814
Shh.

147
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,986
Ovary up, Tick.

148
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,510
Let me see the jar.

149
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,885
Having scraped from the very walls
she is violently allergic to.

150
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,387
Nicely done. We need more.

151
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,221
This took me seven hours.

152
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,324
So seven more hours should be easy.

153
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,926
We only get one shot
to slip this in her bath.

154
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,061
High Queen Margo.

155
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,497
Join me, won't you?

156
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,106
All right. You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

157
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,308
A leader as brave and cunning
as yourself

158
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:36,578
knows that she needs alliances
in order to grow her kingdom.

159
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:37,939
Does she?

160
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,351
Consider this a wedding gift.

161
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,095
Well, don't just stand there.

162
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,302
You've got to get ready for your guests.

163
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,871
Oh, fucking balls.

164
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,446
On Earth, we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first,

165
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,448
or at least know where they come from.

166
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,050
Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

167
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,294
I mean, vaguely.

168
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,520
I was told they're marauding
dickholes who steal stuff.

169
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,557
Well, thanks to the loss of
magic, their mountain crashed

170
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,326
and is now an island off your coast.

171
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,462
Their army, however,

172
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:30,865
numbers 4,000 spears.

173
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,499
Marry into the tribe, it's yours.

174
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,137
Look, somebody already tried to trick me

175
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:39,639
into the whole
"alliance by wedding" thing.

176
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,867
I passed.

177
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:43,055
You had a choice back then.

178
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:45,533
Being a queen

179
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,521
means sacrificing for your people.

180
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,433
Get used to it.

181
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:53,186
Do you want to enlighten me
as to why you give a queef

182
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:55,489
whether I marry
some mountain turd or not?

183
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,391
No, I don't.

184
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,525
High Queen Margo.

185
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:00,193
Jesus.

186
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,995
You scared me.

187
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,329
Were you talking to someone?

188
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,165
No, I just didn't expect
to see you there.

189
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,001
True.

190
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,037
Haven't seen you since...

191
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,429
After our own little near-miss,

192
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,144
I'm a little surprised to see you
running off to the altar so soon.

193
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,675
I hear you there.

194
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,544
I mean, The Floating Mountain?

195
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:21,079
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

196
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,916
They have a real big army.

197
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:28,020
Well, whatever you plan on
doing with all that manpower,

198
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,689
I certainly hope it doesn't put
us on opposite sides.

199
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,059
High King Eliot and your dad
forged an alliance.

200
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:35,628
Nothing's changed.

201
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,398
Is this about the time that we banged

202
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:42,267
and then I opted out of marrying you?

203
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,937
Your insecurity is showing, babe.

204
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:47,306
That was purely political.

205
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:50,309
But if we'd had another round,

206
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,211
I'm certain my charms
would lead you to reconsider...

207
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,936
my queen.

208
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,983
I look forward to our future talks.

209
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,391
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

210
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:09,160
and taken it upon themselves

211
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,597
to set up camp
in your very favorite hallway.

212
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:16,633
I fear there is no way to
complete the task we discussed.

213
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,603
Shit.

214
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:22,106
We have to figure out another weapon.

215
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,574
In the meantime,

216
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:26,610
I need the fastest bunnies you got.

217
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,580
So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

218
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,147
or was.

219
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:33,260
Um, so I figured, you know,
stick the key in...

220
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,452
- Mm.
- Wind it, and...

221
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:36,974
- Logical.
- Right.

222
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,089
Except that there is not a...

223
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,933
you know, there's no keyhole anywhere.

224
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,730
- It's chain-wound.
- Huh?

225
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,593
I took an elective in Horomancy.

226
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:47,330
At castle. Getting married.

227
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,765
Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

228
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,767
At castle. Getting married.

229
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,303
Does that sound like Margo to you?

230
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,172
Need help now, dickwads.

231
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:57,474
Definitely Bambi.

232
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,442
Okay, we have to find a way
to get there.

233
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,377
Um, uh, do you think that the key

234
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:03,278
can create a portal to Fillory somehow?

235
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,648
- Eliot, look.
- Oh.

236
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:08,017
I guess this is my cue.

237
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,635
Okay...

238
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,674
Okay.

239
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:35,510
Well, we should wait
and gather the troops, right?

240
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,414
Go time.

241
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:41,716
Guess this leg of the quest
is you and me.

242
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,822
Okay.

243
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,831
Okay, well, I hope that was
the right choice,

244
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:00,642
'cause the portal just closed.

245
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,837
Do you feel that?

246
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,598
Yeah.

247
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,209
Whoa.

248
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,277
Oh, my God.

249
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,412
Magic.

250
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,347
- Magic. Ha!
- Eliot.

251
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:16,191
- What?
- They...

252
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,218
How is it back?

253
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:21,288
It's not back.

254
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:23,557
Um, is that...

255
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,526
They're constructing the north spire.

256
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,195
Which was built in, uh...

257
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,796
Decades before the Chatwins arrived.

258
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:31,571
We're...

259
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,235
in Fillory in the past.

260
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,681
Ah, shit.

261
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,232
So, in the Fillory books, Jane, um,

262
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:48,967
she decides to try the Mosaic, right?

263
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,369
Uh, but she's too late.

264
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,238
Someone had already solved it first.

265
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:55,040
Who?

266
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,275
Well, I don't know, but maybe it's us,

267
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,728
and that's why we're here now.

268
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,528
I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

269
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,839
when I'm on a good deal of peyote.

270
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,457
Yoo-hoo.

271
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,660
Hiya.

272
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:22,166
It's all yours...

273
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,669
if you don't mind wasting
your gods-damn time.

274
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:32,476
Oh. Well...

275
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,612
auspicious signs abound.

276
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:38,231
Ay.

277
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,689
All right, so 784 tiles in 15 colors.

278
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,759
Uh, so that's 784 factorial,

279
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,074
- uh, divided by...
- Seriously?

280
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:53,496
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

281
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:56,466
Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

282
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:59,536
There's a finite set
of possible solutions, so...

283
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:03,606
Um...

284
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:06,142
Okay, yeah, that's a lot of zeroes.

285
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:08,177
Um, how many zeroes?

286
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,345
- Uh, to be exact?
- Yeah.

287
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,905
A shitload.

288
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:16,163
The mother of your
soon-to-be prince consort

289
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:17,343
wishes to meet with you.

290
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:19,163
Yeah, thanks. Not in the mood.

291
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:22,324
May I present, from the Tribe
of The Floating Mountain.

292
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,693
That Is No Longer Floating,

293
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:26,295
Lady Agate Grey the Stone Queen?

294
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:28,497
Greetings, High Queen Margo.

295
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:31,166
Um, hey, Stone Queen.

296
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:33,535
I'm actually glad you're here.

297
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,900
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

298
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,853
Well, I was led to believe this
was a matter of some urgency.

299
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,411
And who led you to believe that?

300
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:46,081
A mutual royal friend.

301
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,482
Very pale.

302
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:50,518
Look, I'm sure your armies
are super great.

303
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:51,536
It's just...

304
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:53,187
My own wedding was so long ago,

305
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:55,090
I forget how nervous a bride can be.

306
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:57,725
Perhaps we forego superstition

307
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:01,562
and let you meet my son
before the ceremony.

308
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:03,864
Unless you think that's too forward?

309
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,433
Fine.

310
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:08,503
I'd love to meet the man I'm
gonna marry in a couple hours.

311
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,122
Wonderful.

312
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,552
Invite the rest in.

313
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,876
Oh, stand up straight, darling.

314
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:18,612
May I present Prince Fomar.

315
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,180
Okay, no.

316
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,383
Uh-huh. Too freaky, even for me.

317
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,552
Oh, no, Your Highness, of course not.

318
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:26,754
Fomar is far too young.

319
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:27,995
Mother.

320
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:31,425
A pebble's time will come, dear.

321
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,893
Fomar will be your brother-in-law.

322
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,220
Your betrothed...

323
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:40,867
Prince Micah.

324
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,260
Greetings, my queen.

325
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,185
May our great mountain

326
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,662
find its way
through your fertile valley.

327
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,857
Hello, Prince Micah.

328
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:00,452
Why don't you two take a moment

329
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:03,263
to get to know each other... alone?

330
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,100
Let's go. Come on.

331
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,464
How can I make this right
for you, my queen?

332
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:14,800
Are you one of those sick fuck princes

333
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,602
who likes to shoot girls with arrows,

334
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:19,572
or am I gonna wake up tomorrow
chained to a wall?

335
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:22,941
If you are, I will free you,
if you command.

336
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,776
You are a woman.

337
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:26,945
Okay.

338
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:31,282
Since you mention women, let's discuss.

339
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,351
Our women are leaders.

340
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,620
They are the cave, full of wisdom.

341
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,523
Men are the boulder, full of strength.

342
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,625
The spear with the boulder...

343
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:41,959
Yeah, okay.

344
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:43,780
I get the idea.

345
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,015
So, matriarchy, huh?

346
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:52,370
Society where women
hold the primary power.

347
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,605
Is that not the way it is
everywhere, my queen?

348
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,816
It is.

349
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,646
I still don't understand why we
have to do this in the same room.

350
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:07,726
It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

351
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,007
Oh, my queen.

352
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,878
I am unharmed, and you?

353
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,545
I'm good.

354
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,024
Um, one sec, okay?

355
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:48,610
Are you seriously accusing me
of trying to kill Micah?

356
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,505
Why in Loria's name would I do that?

357
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,165
I don't know. Why would you?

358
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,843
You know, you didn't
seem all that excited

359
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:58,013
about the wedding yourself
last time we talked.

360
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,814
Are you suggesting I did it?

361
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,749
Is your war council getting afraid

362
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,818
of our alliance with the Floaters?

363
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:06,720
You told me we had nothing to fear.

364
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,315
And you told me you'd win me with charm.

365
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:12,359
If I'd actually tried to kill
that walking jawline, he'd be dead.

366
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,327
It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

367
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:16,271
and tried to kill someone
to get your way.

368
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,867
Spoken like someone who's
really starting to miss me.

369
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:19,931
Honey...

370
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,402
you ain't even top 50,

371
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:27,693
and you ain't getting another
chance to kill my husband.

372
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,330
Guards!

373
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,277
Lock him up.

374
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,912
And be a little rough about it.

375
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,561
Yeah, they're still not moving, Q.

376
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:53,365
Son of a...

377
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,573
I checked...

378
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:57,535
Look, I've checked the Circumstances,

379
00:18:57,545 --> 00:18:58,736
and the Slavic is perfect.

380
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,038
It should work. I don't...

381
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:02,374
Unless magic doesn't work on this.

382
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:04,575
Great. Brought back to a time
when magic exists

383
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,310
except on the one thing
that we need it to.

384
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,712
Okay, okay, so... so what?

385
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:10,381
We do it the old-fashioned way.
We're smart. We can do hard things.

386
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,550
This is an impossible thing, Eliot.

387
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,615
We have to show the beauty of all life.

388
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:16,107
- The beauty of all life?
- Yeah.

389
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,810
What does that mean, and how are
we supposed to show it with tiles?

390
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:20,573
We're not gonna show it with
fucking math, Quentin!

391
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,851
- This is the stupidest puzzle!
- No, no, no.

392
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,996
- I...
- This is our quest.

393
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:28,706
We have to do it ourselves.

394
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,439
I'm not saying that it's not
going to take a while.

395
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:38,942
Logic this with me for one second, okay?

396
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,846
Jane came along too late, right?

397
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:45,582
Someone came to the Mosaic and solved it

398
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:46,917
before she even got here...

399
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:48,919
gets here... will get here.

400
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,521
You tried to convince me
that someone was us.

401
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,856
Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

402
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:58,494
Well, in the absence of a better option,
let's... let's at least try, huh?

403
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,435
Is Penny with you?

404
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:07,437
He needed some time to himself.

405
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,805
What are you doing?

406
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:13,509
Uh, I've just been trying to figure
out this thing that Penny told me...

407
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,711
uh, something that he saw
in the astral plane.

408
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:19,014
These aren't magic. These are religion.

409
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:20,683
Yeah.

410
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:22,459
We're in that territory.

411
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,126
Alice needs your help.

412
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:32,627
Who are you?

413
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,668
Help her, Julia.

414
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:48,473
What the fuck?

415
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,690
Okay.

416
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:59,020
Let's go get a drink. Yeah?

417
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,066
Everyone, gather around.

418
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,836
Greetings, Fillorians, Floaters.

419
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:18,547
We gather to join two great lands.

420
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,054
High Queen Margo,

421
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:35,922
do you take Micah

422
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:38,925
of the Tribe of The Floating Mountain...

423
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:41,061
That Is No Longer Floating

424
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,695
to be yours,

425
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,731
binding your houses together
for eternity?

426
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,801
Oh, what the hell?

427
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:50,477
Traditional Earth saying.

428
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,940
Prince Micah,

429
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,209
do you take Margo of the Tribe of Hanson

430
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,878
to be yours,

431
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:02,548
binding your houses together
for eternity?

432
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:04,270
I do.

433
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:24,752
When the rock crumbles in our hand,

434
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:27,236
we must reach for the next.

435
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,536
Pickwick, continue, per custom.

436
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:31,809
What?

437
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,777
Yes, yes, of course, you're right.

438
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:37,685
What are you talking about?

439
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,584
What custom?

440
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:44,488
Uh, when tragedy befalls
a royal wedding,

441
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:48,244
it is the solemn duty of the
surviving sibling to carry out...

442
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:50,627
- What?
- It is my duty

443
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,794
and honor

444
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,264
to take the place of my...

445
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:57,000
late brother.

446
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,536
But he... he fucking killed him.

447
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:04,007
- He murdered his own brother!
- That does not affect my duty.

448
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,712
Are you people all crazy?

449
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,783
Marry him...

450
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,218
now.

451
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:35,440
God damn it!

452
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,368
I'm done.

453
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:39,937
Okay.

454
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:43,474
Just don't take it apart
until I write it down.

455
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,383
Okay.

456
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:57,387
God damn it.

457
00:23:57,397 --> 00:23:59,456
I'll write it down.

458
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:02,058
Okay, yeah, so you just fill in...

459
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:05,028
- fill that in with red.
- Oh, my God.

460
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,896
You know, you're not going
to get very far

461
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:09,132
if you're this frustrated after 14 days.

462
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:10,199
How are you not?

463
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:11,901
Oh, Q.

464
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:13,903
You know the answer.

465
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,206
<i>Can you imagine Margo
putting up with this tedium?</i>

466
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:19,908
<i>No, not even a little.</i>

467
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,311
<i>She'd have blown it up day two.</i>

468
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:23,979
What is that, anyway?

469
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:25,248
You know, not everything

470
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,150
has to look like something, Eliot.

471
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,218
Ah, it's the eternal argument.

472
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:33,022
Realism versus abstract expressionism.

473
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,589
Mm, okay.

474
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,591
Green.

475
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,926
Green.

476
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,995
- Yeah.
- Yeah, green one.

477
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:41,329
There.

478
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,597
No, no, there.

479
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,033
- There?
- No.

480
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,183
There.

481
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,087
Just kidding. You had it right
the first time.

482
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,171
You know what? I'll tell you
where I'll put this.

483
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:50,505
Yeah? Come at me, Coldwater.

484
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,341
Peaches? Plums?

485
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,376
Arielle.

486
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:55,443
I'm Eliot.

487
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,046
- This is my friend, Quentin.
- Hi, there.

488
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,214
Hi.

489
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:01,349
Oh, this is my helper, Lunk.

490
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,521
Happy anniversary, Q.

491
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:10,558
To our first and last year
at this thing.

492
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

493
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,467
I, um...

494
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,107
Um, so...

495
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:28,309
Yeah.

496
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,977
Um...

497
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,214
let's just save our overthinking

498
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:35,949
for the puzzle, yeah?

499
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,318
Yeah.

500
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,524
We could be done tomorrow
for all you know.

501
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:51,564
We can't just throw away
all this time we've invested.

502
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:54,467
You want to live your life,
live it here.

503
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:56,068
What is that supposed to mean?

504
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:58,170
You know exactly what that means.

505
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:05,511
Oops.

506
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:08,414
I don't know. It's just...

507
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

508
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:15,687
No Lunk today?

509
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,523
Found him holding
someone else's peaches.

510
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:24,263
Sorry, I, um...

511
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:26,598
I mean, I always thought you
were too good for him anyway.

512
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,682
Come visit soon.

513
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:19,049
Of course.

514
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,718
- If we're not here...
- I know, Dad.

515
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:25,722
I love you, too.

516
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:41,604
You ever think about them?

517
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:42,672
My grandkids?

518
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:46,042
No, um...

519
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:47,243
our friends...

520
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:51,047
Uh, from our lives before.

521
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,417
I dream about them sometimes.

522
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,302
Eliot...

523
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,651
Did you just solve the Mosaic?

524
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,392
With a friend.

525
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,397
We solved it together.

526
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:53,798
Well, this is dreadful!

527
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,633
You see...

528
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:57,702
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude.

529
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,572
- My name is...
- Jane Chatwin.

530
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:02,406
Do I know you?

531
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,741
You do look...

532
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,710
Ah, just one of those faces.

533
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,411
The dwarves...

534
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:10,581
They built me this watch.

535
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:13,384
It's terribly important.

536
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,594
I need that key to power it.

537
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,757
It sort of took us a while to, um...

538
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,593
It's just...

539
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,761
My brother, he's...

540
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:26,597
he's become dangerous,

541
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,765
and I'm trying to stop him.

542
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:30,433
The dwarves told me

543
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:32,836
if everything gets
too buggered up to fix,

544
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:34,671
I could use this watch.

545
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:37,674
To create time loops.

546
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:40,443
You need the key to stop The Beast.

547
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:42,153
What's The Beast?

548
00:30:43,856 --> 00:30:46,357
Unfortunately, you'll find out.

549
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,871
You have to take it.

550
00:31:02,608 --> 00:31:04,675
Here.

551
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:10,305
Thank you.

552
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,083
My queen,

553
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,077
time to complete our marriage.

554
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:49,114
We must become one flesh.

555
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,916
- Right?
- I told you...

556
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:52,650
it's Earth tradition.

557
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,952
But must you really open every present

558
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:56,621
before we can consummate?

559
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,124
Well, if I don't...

560
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:02,693
your manhood will rot and drop off

561
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,962
like an overripe banana.

562
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:06,764
Better not to chance it.

563
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,164
Don't wait up.

564
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:32,489
<i>So I arranged for this to be delivered</i>

565
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,558
<i>the day of your wedding,</i>

566
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:36,838
<i>way, way in advance.</i>

567
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:39,829
<i>Long story. Anyway, I hope you're okay.</i>

568
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,131
<i>No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.</i>

569
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:45,401
<i>Eliot and I are both dead.</i>

570
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:47,503
<i>Uh, the quest sent us</i>

571
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,405
<i>to the past...
again, super-long story...</i>

572
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:54,711
<i>and you should know
that we led full, good lives,</i>

573
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:59,182
<i>and we took the quest
as far as we could, and...</i>

574
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,817
<i>now there's something
that we need you to do.</i>

575
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:16,065
Hello, Margo.

576
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:17,833
Hi.

577
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,101
Didn't you die?

578
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:21,070
On the linear plane, yes.

579
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,072
Not here, in the Clock Barrens.

580
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:24,707
Right.

581
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:27,710
So some kind of timey-wimey
magic going on here.

582
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,845
Time loops are not my only trick.

583
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:31,446
Here I managed to create a spot

584
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,215
where all moments exist
at the same time,

585
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:35,517
overlapping.

586
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,051
So, even if you're dead...

587
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,753
You're alive here.

588
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,788
And dead, too, I suppose.

589
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:42,724
This is a place outside of time.

590
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:46,104
Well, I got a note from Quentin.
He told me you could give me a key.

591
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:47,528
Yes.

592
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,931
The key is here,
but I can't give it to you.

593
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,933
It's what keeps
the Clock Barrens stable.

594
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,705
That said, I would like
to help you, Margo.

595
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:56,570
I don't need help. I need the key.

596
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,906
Now, I'm sorry, but I've had
a bad couple of days,

597
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,742
and my best friends are dead,

598
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:03,977
and, frankly, I wish I had
your magic, or any magic,

599
00:34:03,987 --> 00:34:06,113
'cause I'd like to build
my own Clock Barrens

600
00:34:06,123 --> 00:34:09,617
right about now and just live there

601
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:12,586
for, like, five minutes
without anyone trying to usurp

602
00:34:12,596 --> 00:34:14,755
or marry or educate or hump me.

603
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,558
It is exhausting.

604
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:20,627
You're going to be
a very, very powerful magician

605
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:22,095
and queen.

606
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:25,598
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

607
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:27,968
Eliot and Quentin
make all the real moves.

608
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:30,603
I'm more of a Fillorian middle manager.

609
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:32,739
I know how that feels.

610
00:34:32,749 --> 00:34:34,641
Sometimes like you're
a supporting player

611
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:36,609
in somebody else's story.

612
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,911
Your tale is your own, Margo.

613
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:40,112
You may not get

614
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,947
the appreciation you deserve, frankly,

615
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,749
or the peace,

616
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:45,251
but it is yours,

617
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:47,787
and I can tell you, it won't be boring.

618
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,791
Thank you.

619
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,826
Now, as to how I can help...

620
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,527
out there in the linear plane,

621
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:57,262
the key rests on my body at Brakebills.

622
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,165
I can send you there, no problem.

623
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,133
You're telling me to dig up your corpse.

624
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,968
How the hell can you be
so chipper about it?

625
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,937
Eh, hasn't happened yet.

626
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:07,639
And I'm very English.

627
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:10,642
It's been so good to chat to you, Margo.

628
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,644
Ready to go?

629
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:13,778
Yeah.

630
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,682
I guess this is my cue.

631
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,688
Wait!

632
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:25,323
You bitches looking for these?

633
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,629
Fuck.

634
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,889
That entrance line was
the only thing keeping me going

635
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,666
through six feet of dirt and corpse.

636
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,235
Bambi. Hey.

637
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:40,078
And I swore I wouldn't do this.

638
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,343
Wow.

639
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,345
I mean, I can't believe we died.

640
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,747
- Sort of weird.
- Sad, right?

641
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:51,148
But we didn't die.

642
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,649
It was an alternate timeline

643
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,918
and one that we never have to live now.

644
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:56,754
Margo, you saved our lives.

645
00:35:56,764 --> 00:36:00,758
In addition to robbing
the cradle and a grave.

646
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:03,227
I'll never get that smell
out of my hair.

647
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:08,698
I mean, I know who I was.

648
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,667
I was Alice Quinn.

649
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,935
I was the best at something,

650
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,604
at magic,

651
00:36:14,614 --> 00:36:17,674
but then magic took over,
and I lost Alice,

652
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:19,776
and by the time I got her back,
I lost magic.

653
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,878
Okay, so how can I help?

654
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:26,048
I could use magic, and you have it.

655
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,284
- Why do you have it?
- Mm.

656
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:30,086
Prevailing theory?

657
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:33,089
Extra sprinkles on the cupcake
from when Our Lady Underground

658
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,125
restored my Shade, but...

659
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,927
she didn't exactly leave a note, so...

660
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:41,029
So you don't know.

661
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,365
I mean, do I want to know?

662
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,933
Yes.

663
00:36:44,943 --> 00:36:46,935
I mean, if you want to understand it,

664
00:36:46,945 --> 00:36:49,772
you need to know.

665
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:53,208
Hey, all magic has a provenance.

666
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:58,379
Uh, there was this machine
that the professors would use.

667
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:02,083
Yeah, Q showed it to me,
but it doesn't work anymore.

668
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:04,920
Right, of course not.

669
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:09,224
What about the key?

670
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:10,925
It shows the truth of things, right?

671
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:12,893
Have you tried using that?

672
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,895
I've held it.

673
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:21,268
Maybe a mirror could help you focus it.

674
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,242
Yeah, okay.

675
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:43,157
What?

676
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,613
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

677
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,305
Have a seat, Julia.

678
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:01,883
It's time for us to talk.

679
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,071
What did you do to me?

680
00:38:09,174 --> 00:38:11,898
I planted a seed for you to grow.

681
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:14,635
Without telling me or asking me?

682
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,422
I've tried to guide you
as gently as I could.

683
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:20,290
I saw his eyes.

684
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,234
I saw Reynard's eyes.

685
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:27,263
Because the seed comes from him.

686
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:28,764
Are you kidding me?

687
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,433
I took it from him and gave it to you,

688
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:34,103
and when you showed mercy,
you earned this.

689
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:35,704
You didn't think before shoving

690
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,016
some rapist's seed inside me to ask?

691
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,945
You gods are real shaky

692
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,779
on the concept of consent,
you know that?

693
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,315
It doesn't matter where it comes from.

694
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,918
It matters what you do with it.

695
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:51,720
I don't want it.

696
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,722
I don't accept it.

697
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,459
Do you think the chosen
want to be chosen?

698
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:59,428
I don't want a molecule of his power.

699
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,371
It's not his anymore.

700
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,966
It's yours.

701
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,808
This might sound horrible,

702
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,143
but he's gone.

703
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,112
Does it matter where it came from?

704
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,313
It's magic.

705
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,815
You sound like her.

706
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,485
Yeah, well, maybe she's right.

707
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,420
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

708
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,323
I'd do anything to get it back.

709
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,093
If I could give it to you, I would.

710
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,410
What if you could?

711
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,010
Kady, have a seat, please.

712
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,513
Actually, I need to sign out.

713
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,481
Yes, well, let's talk about that.

714
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:57,384
No offense, but we just did.

715
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,820
So, if there's something
for me to sign or...

716
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,856
Kady, you are a danger
to yourself and to others.

717
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:04,791
<i>You say "I love you,"</i>

718
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:07,347
<i>I swear to God,
I will find a way to kill you.</i>

719
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,862
<i>At least then, this would be over.</i>

720
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:12,881
So who do you think you're talking to?

721
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,134
Who did you want to kill?

722
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:17,870
This is not something you'll understand.

723
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,507
Kady, we're going to give you
a light sedative.

724
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,079
Bob...

725
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:23,960
move.

726
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:26,854
Kady!

727
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,549
Code gray.

728
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,825
No, no, no!

729
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:41,060
No, God damn it!

730
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,161
You can't do this!

731
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:43,222
No!

732
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:48,167
Well...

733
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:51,570
you guys got to loop
out of your shitty past.

734
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,440
Looks like I'm stuck with mine.

735
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,343
We are not leaving you alone with this.

736
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:02,346
There's the old ball and chain now.

737
00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:03,882
I better catch some rest

738
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:05,917
before he wakes up with a boner

739
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:08,294
and some bad, bad ideas.

740
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,299
- Déjà vu.
- Peaches and...

741
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:58,168
- Peaches and plums.
- Peaches and plums.

742
00:41:58,178 --> 00:42:00,337
Peaches and plums. Peaches and plums.

743
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:08,011
I got so old.

744
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,247
You died.

745
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,121
I died.

746
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:25,093
You had a wife.

747
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,500
And we had a family.

748
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,336
How... how...

749
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:38,540
how do we remember that?

750
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,276
I don't know.
