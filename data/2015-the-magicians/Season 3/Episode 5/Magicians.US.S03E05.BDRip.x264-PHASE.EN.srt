The Magicians...

00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,380
I wouldn't. Playing with time
is such difficult magic.

QUENTIN: This is Jane
Chatwin, all grown up.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,381
We know about the time loops
that you keep making.

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,682
As you should by now.

Prince Ess of Loria.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,954
I like you.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,963
Tick, you're going to go to
that fairy repellent hallway

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,795
and you're gonna grind
one of those bricks to dust.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,233
You're gonna put it
in the Fairy Queen's bath.

11
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,235
I'm gonna cut out
her heart and eat it.

12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,499
No, come on, Penny.
Don't... Don't... Come on.

13
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,235
I was astral projecting.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,741
I wasn't in my body
when I died.

15
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,539
Thank you.

16
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,375
You're missing
the signs, Julia.

17

We've been... We've been
calling it the Truth Key,

21
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,361
'cause it...
Well, it reveals truths.

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,363
Mmm. loan handle
a little truth.

23
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,864
Oh, hey, Penny.

24
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,560
Wait.

25
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,695
Hi.

26
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,902

Um, don't talk shit on Penny.

31
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,850
He's... He's here.
He's coming with me.

32
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,412
QUENTIN: oh, okay.

33
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,890
Hi, Penny.

34
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,685
Right, sorry. Um...

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,357
You heard
about Brakebills, right?

36
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,559
Well, it turns out,
the Physical Cottage

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,468
has been, like,
magically moved so many times

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,733
that, uh, there's no
valid deed on it,

39
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,470
so, like, you can't sell
something that you don't own,

40
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,135
so we can... Um...

41
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,443
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,950
I'm not trying
to make it weird.

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,610
It's just weird now.

44
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,916
It just is.
It's just weird.

45
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:51,979
Sorry.

46
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,953
So I'm going to take the key
so I can see Penny,

47
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,152

you went to rehab.

Hold this.

for a billion years.

00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,879
Why are you acting
like this is good news?

69
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,071
Because...

70
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,041

00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,673

00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,179
And I'm sorry.

I can't touch you.

Yeah, but, Kady, I...

96

No. If you say "I love you," I swear
to God, I will find a way to kill you.

97
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,373
At least then,
this would be over.

to take your advice again.

Besides, I sent them
with Todd,

so it's not like
I'm completely irresponsible.

106
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,688
Look, if you really want
to talk about this

107
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,159
instead of getting over Alice,
then we can, but...

108
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,854
I'm sorry. Look...

109
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,657
I know that ifs all shitty
right now, but...

110
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,168
At least we're doing
whatever we can to fix it.

111
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,033
Mmm.
Right?

112
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:31,007
And when we do, maybe Alice will
act like someone I recognize.

113
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,667
On the plus,
you didn't exaggerate.

114
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,873
This book is strangely
compelling, yet incomplete.

115
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,349
Yeah, it's
a one-step-at-a-time quest.

116
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,888
Um...
Okay, so the chapter, right?

117
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,653
It's about the daughter's training
to become a knight, right'?

118
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,285
And it is...
It's sort of fascinating

119
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,627
how it plays with the classic
trope of the hero's journey.

120
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,689
Right. Cute.
Where do we get the key?

121

Mmm-hmm.

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,837
It's the Mosaic.

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,038
What's the Mosaic?

127
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,169
The Mosaic.

Are you kidding me?

133
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,253
You use the tiles
to create a design

134
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,053
that reflects
the beauty of all life,

135
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,252
and when you do,
there's a mystery prize.

136
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,057
You've... Really,
you've never heard of this?

137
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,097
"The beauty of all life"?

138
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,895
Sounds appropriately vague
and impossible.

139
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,162
What's the prize?

140
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,399
A so-called key
to greater magic.

when the metaphors

Let me see the jar.

00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,762
Having scraped from the very walls
she is violently allergic to.

153
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,273
Nicely done. We need more.

154
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,104
This took me seven hours.

155
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,235
So seven more hours
should be easy.

156
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,804

to slip this in her bath.

All right. You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

A leader as brave
and cunning as yourself

in order to grow her kingdom.

Does she?

00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,529
into the whole
"alliance by wedding" thing.

180
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,962
I passed.

181
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,160
You had a choice back then.

182
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,231
Being a queen means
sacrificing for your people.

183
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,201
Get used to it.

184
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,867
Do you want to enlighten me
as to why you give a queef

185
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,378
whether I marry
some mountain turd or not?

186
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,311
No, I don't.

187
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,350
High Queen Margo.
Jesus.

188
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,884
You scared me.

189
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,215
Were you talking to someone?

190
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,051
No, I just didn't expect
to see you there.

191
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,347
True.

192
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,551
Haven't seen you since...

193
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,394
After our own
little near-miss,

194
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,260
I'm a little surprised
to see you running off

195
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,561
to the altar so soon.
I hear you there.

196
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,431
I mean, The Floating Mountain?

197
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,005
They don't have much
in the way of resources.

198
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,837
They have a real big army.

199
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,902
Well, whatever you plan on
doing with all that manpower,

200
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,572
I certainly hope it doesn't
put us on opposite sides.

201
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,947
High King Eliot and your dad
forged an alliance.

202
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,542
Nothing's changed.

203
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,947
(SIGHS)

204
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,345
Is this about the time
that we banged

205
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,551
and then I opted
out of marrying you?

206
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,854
Your insecurity
is showing, babe.

207
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,397
That was purely political.

208
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,426
But if we'd had
another round,

209
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,066
I'm certain my charms would
lead you to reconsider...

210
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,365
my Queen.

211
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,768
I look forward
to our future talks.

212
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,275
Your Queeniness, the groom's
wedding party has arrived,

213
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,080
and taken it upon themselves

214
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,488
to set up camp in your
very favorite hallway.

215
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,561
I fear there is no way to
complete the task we discussed.

216
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,993
Shit.

217
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,998
We have to figure out
another weapon.

218
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,968
In the meantime, I need the
fastest bunnies you got.

219
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,472
So we know that this
is a portal to Fillory...

220
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,064
<i>Or was.</i>

221
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,111
Um... So I figured, you know,
stick the key in...

222
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,339
Mmm.
Wind it, and...

223
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,142
Logical.
Right.

224
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:41,014
Except that there is not a... You
know, there's no keyhole anywhere.

225
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,916
It's chain-wound.
Huh?

226
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,478
I took an elective
in Horomancy.

227
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,251
At castle.
Getting married.

228
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,657
Well, hello, there,
little plot development.

229
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,660
At castle.
Getting married.

230
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,856
Does that sound like Margo to you?
Uh...

231
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,966
Need help now, dickwads.

232
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,295
Definitely Bambi.

233
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,334
Okay, we have to find
a way to get there.

234
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,166
Um, do you think that the key

235
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,172
can create a portal
to Fillory somehow?

236
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,435
Eliot, look.

237
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,942
I guess this is my cue.

238
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,682
(TICKING RAPIDLY)

239
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,529
Okay...

<i>0K3'! -</i>

242
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,401
Well, we should wait
and gather the troops, right?

243
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,337
Go time.

244
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,640
Guess this leg of the quest
is you and me.

245
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,344
<i>0K3'! -</i>

246
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,725
Okay, well, I hope that was
the right choice,

247
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,093
'cause the portal
just closed.

248
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,732
Do you feel that?

249
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,858
Yeah.

250
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,031
Whoa.

251
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,269
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God.

252
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,603
Magic.

253
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,678
Magic.

254
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,608
What?
They...

255
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,104
How is it back?

256
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,239
It's not back.

258
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,682

00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,562
In Fillory in the past.

263
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,529
(EXHALES)

264
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,370
Oh, shit.

265
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,467
So, in the Fillory books,
Jane, um...

266
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,039
She decides to try
the Mosaic, right?

267
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,410
Uh, but she's too late.

268
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,541
Someone had already
solved it first.

269
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,374
Who?

270
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,980
Well, I don't know, but maybe it's
us, and that's why we're here now.

271
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,319
I don't know. Time travel
only really makes sense to me

272
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,416
when I'm on a good deal
of peyote.

273
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,927
Hmm.

274
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,999
Yoo-hoo. Hiya.

275
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,410
It's all yours...

276
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,448
lf you don't mind wasting
your goddamn time.

277
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,320
Oh. Well...

278
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,922
Auspicious signs abound.

280
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,659
All right,
so 784 tiles in 15 colors.

281
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:50,138
So that's 784 factorial,
divided by...

00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,607
Seriously?

00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,473
You're trying to calculate
the beauty of all life?

Uh, well, I'm just trying
to see what we're in for.

00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,506
There's a finite set
of possible solutions, so...

Um...

287
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,123
Okay, yeah,
that's a lot of zeroes.

288
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,556
Um, how many zeroes?

289
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,885
Uh, to be exact?
Yeah.

290
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,794
A shitload.

soon-to-be prince consort

00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,133
wishes to meet with you.

293
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,794
Yeah, thanks.
Not in the mood.

294
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,303
May I present,

295
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,671

Mountain That ls No Longer Floating,

Um... Hey, Stone Queen.

299
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,514
I'm actually glad
you're here.

300
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:37,680
I'd like to discuss
postponing the nuptials.

301
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,657
Well, I was led to believe this
was a matter of some urgency.

302
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,387
And who led you
to believe that'?

303
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,054
A mutual royal friend.

304
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,426
Very pale.

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,501
Look, Iâ€™m sure your armies
are super great.

306
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,728
It's just...

307
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,996
My own wedding
was so long ago,

308
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,061
I forget how nervous
a bride can be.

(LAUGHS)

310
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,707
Perhaps we forgo superstition

311
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,541
and let you meet my son
before the ceremony.

312
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,842
Unless you think
that's too forward?

313
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,904
Fine.

314
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,452
I'd love to meet the man I'm
gonna marry in a couple hours.

315
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,576
Wonderful.

316
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,078
Invite the rest in.

00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,852
Oh, stand up
straight, darling.

318
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,589
May I present Prince Fomar.

319
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,789
Okay, no. Uh-uh.

320
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,361
Too freaky, even for me.

321
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,528
Oh, no, Your Highness,
of course not.

322
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,729
Fomar is far too young.

323
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,794

00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,568
A pebble's time
will come, dear.

Why don't you two take a moment to
get to know each other... Alone?

Let's go. Come on.

334
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,450
How can I make this right
for you, my Queen?

335
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:16,578
Are you one of those sick fuck princes

336
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,521
or am I gonna wake up tomorrow
chained to a wall?

If you are, I will free you,
if you command.

Our women are leaders.

They are the cave,
full of wisdom.

00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,505
Men are the boulder,
full of strength.

The spear with the boulder...

345
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,940
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, okay.

346
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,446
I get the idea.

347
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,483
So, matriarchy, huh?

348
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,355
Society where women
hold the primary power.

349
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,857
Is that not the way
it is everywhere, my Queen?

350
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,153
(INHALES SHARPLY)

351
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,857
It is.

352
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,624
I still don't understand
why we have to do this

353
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,859
in the same room.

354
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,562
It's a Floater custom, ma'am,
and it has its advantages.

358
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,865
lam unharmed, and you?

359
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,525
I'm good.

360
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,667
Um... One sec, okay?

361
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,000
Mmm-hmm.

362
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,408
Are you seriously accusing me
of trying to kill Micah?

363
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,344
Why in Loria's name
would I do that?

364
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,283
I don't know.
Why would you?

365
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,875
You know, you didn't seem
all that excited

366
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,717
about the wedding yourself
last time we talked.

367
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,849
Are you suggesting I did it?

368
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,861
Is your war council getting afraid
of our alliance with the Floaters?

369
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,760
You told me
we had nothing to fear.

370
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,025
And you told me
you'd win me with charm.

371
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,399
If I'd actually tried to kill that
walking jawline, he'd be dead.

372
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,369
It's not the first time
you've waltzed in

373
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,963
and tried to kill someone
to get your way.

374
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,736
Spoken like someone who's
really starting to miss me.

375
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,440
Honey...
You ain't even top 50,

376
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:27,541
and you ain't getting another
chance to kill my husband.

377
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,778
Guards!

378
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,587
Lock him up.

379
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,947
And be a little rough
about it.

380
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,601
Yeah, they're still
not moving, Q.

381

382
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,139

383
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,778
Look, I've checked the Circumstances,
and the Slavic is perfect.

384
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,078
It should work. I don't.â€œ

doesn't work on this.

386

Great. Brought back to a time
when magic exists

387
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,350
except on the one thing
that we need it to.

388
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,753
Okay, okay, so... So what?

389
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,951
We do it
the old-fashioned way.

390
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,426
We're smart.
We can do hard things.

391
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,588
This is
an impossible thing, Eliot.

392
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,495
We have to show
the beauty of all life.

393
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,622
The beauty of all life?
Yeah.

394
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,996
What does that mean,

395
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,796
and how are we supposed
to show it with tiles?

396
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,496
We're not gonna show it
with fucking math, Quentin!

397
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,834
This is the stupidest puzzle!
No, no, no.

398
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,036
I...
This is our quest.

399
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,479
We have to do it ourselves.

400
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,481
I'm not saying that it's not
going to take a while.

401
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,986
Logic this with me
for one second, okay?

402
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,316
Hmm?

403
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,891
Jane came along
too late, right?

404
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:46,953
Someone came to the Mosaic and solved
it before she even got here...

405
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,965
Gets here... Will get here.

406
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,525
You tried to convince me
that someone was us. Hmm?

407
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,832
Yeah, but I didn't think that
it was gonna take a decade.

408
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,364
Well, in the absence of a better option,
let's.-. Let's at least try, huh?

some time to himself.

What are you doing?

413
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,987
I've just been trying
to figure out this thing

414
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,546
that Penny told me...

415
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,751
Something that he saw
in the Astral Plane.

416
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:19,057
These aren't magic.
These are religion.

417
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,255
Yeah.

solve the Mosaic?

With a friend.

551
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,149
They built me this watch.

552
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,512

553

and I'm trying to stop him.

gets too buggered up to fix,

from Quentin.

give me a key.

The key is here,
but I can't give it to you.

It's what keeps
the Clock Barrens stable.

That said, I would like
to help you, Margo.
