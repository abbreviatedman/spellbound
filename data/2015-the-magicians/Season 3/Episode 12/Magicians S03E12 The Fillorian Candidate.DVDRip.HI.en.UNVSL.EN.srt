Previously on "Us"...

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,563
What? Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,937
<i>A group of fine-looking grad students
were invited to a secret school for magic</i>

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,812
<i>where a bunch of stuff happened
that doesn't really matter,</i>

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,910
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,717
The answer to a riddle
they didn't even know to ask.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,154
It's you.

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,714
Do you want this recap or not?

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,489
So, yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,963
<i>For a minute. We
became kings and queens.</i>

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,330
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,201
<i>Everyone hooked up. I had
a threesome with two harpies.</i>

13
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,604
Skip to the parts about me.

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,734
JOSH: <i>You had a lot of
drama with your hands.</i>

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,836
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

16
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,211
<i>to help out Kady.</i>

17
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,909
Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,483
JOSH: <i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,489
<i>Looks like she could crack
open your balls, because she can?</i>

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,526
<i>Well, it was a
love for the ages.</i>

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,562
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,652
<i>with some hedge witches.</i>

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,824
Especially her best bitch, Julia
Wicker. Their term, not mine.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,923
(STAMMERS) I would never.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,301
Whatever went down
definitely made them ex-best...

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,762
Witches.

27
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,570
Truthfully, the only person
Kady can stand is you.

28
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,804
And that pretty
much cut both ways.

29
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,938
No, come on, Penny,
don't... Don't... Come on.

30
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,573
JOSH: <i>And then
you died. Kind of.</i>

31
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,177
Meanwhile, magic
got all jacked up.

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,523
You know what's weird,
that "jacked up" is bad,

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,559
but "jacked off" is great.

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,752
Focus, dude.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,662
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of fairy dicks

36
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,894
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,663
<i>so the people revolted.</i>

38
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,794
<i>Only ray of hope?</i>

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,031
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,165
Why? Question mark!

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,905
<i>We got sent on a dope quest to
find the Seven Keys that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,507
<i>But the fourth one got dragon-gobbled
and lost in the Underworld.</i>

43
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,144
The other Penny sent us
the key, but never came back.

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,916
Then came my grand adventure.

45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,013
Hard pass.

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,924
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

47
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,827
And snagged up key seven.
Yeah, I was there for that.

48
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,158
You didn't save shit.

49
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,927
Now wait, you
skipped the Sixth Key.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,696
This makes no goddamn sense.

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,567
No, it's intentionally
confusing.

52
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,904
<i>You see, Julia saved a
bunch of fairies from slavery,</i>

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,739
<i>so the Fairy Queen was
like, "I have the Sixth Key,</i>

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,473
<i>"but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's..."</i>

55
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,913
A creamy bitch is what she is.

56
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,577
JULIA: <i>Meanwhile, Alice
has been acting real fishy.</i>

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,745
Quentin was all like...

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,896
Are you working for the Library?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,411
And she was all... Yes.

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,085
And now, if you would please
refer to the hookup/murder chart.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,027
Penny got with the other Alice.

62
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,119
Interesting.

63
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,427
Now that we know
who porked whom,

64
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,163
let's go over who murdered whom.

65
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,698
KADY: Penny?

66
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,833
(EXCLAIMS)

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,673
You're Kady.

68
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,772
What's going on?

69
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,045
I'm not your Penny.

70
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,651
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

71
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,468
(INDISTINCT WHISPERS)

72
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,062
QUENTIN: Julia?

73
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,671
Sorry, uh, what?

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,504
What I'm saying is, if there's
a monster behind the door,

75
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,601
opening the door is
probably not the smartest plan.

76
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,170
But that's where magic is, like...
What, we can't exactly just stop.

77
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,409
Plus, this didn't come from
the most reliable source.

78
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,815
He was you.

79
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,079
He was The Beast.

80
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,281
Making decisions like this without
understanding the consequences

81
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,586
is exactly why magic is gone.

82
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,253
So we figure out if it's true.

83
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,889
We... We search the
castle, find out what's inside.

84
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,863
We could ask the Library.

85
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,371
Yeah, you're right.
You should ask them.

86
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,134
They say they want to help.

87
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,573
It'd be nice if
they actually did.

88
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,201
I'll let you know what they say.

89
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,573
Q...

90
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,809
Do you have a better plan?

91
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,684
JULIA: Yeah, maybe
don't trust the Library?

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,054
They literally snort
the bones of fairies.

93
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,717
We don't have to trust them.

94
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,869
The Penny that you
brought with you,

95
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,191
the... Penny 23.

96
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,285
Yeah, look.

97
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,991
Ask him to follow
Alice to the Library.

98
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,899
He can Astral Project, they'll
never even know he was there.

99
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,832
Catching up on the news?

100
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,202
My timeline was
post-apocalyptic,

101
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,076
and it wasn't this fucked up.

102
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,781
Alice is meeting
with the Library.

103
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,081
We need you to follow
her on the Astral Plane.

104
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,384
Q thinks you're more
likely to say yes if I ask,

105
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,256
because you and the
other me shared a thing.

106
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,851
But we both know that
we're total strangers.

107
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,453
So... Go on.

108
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,599
Well... See, this is a
chance to unfuck magic.

109
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,097
And as a new
citizen of Timeline 40,

110
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,039
that should be something
you would want to do.

111
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,439
Whoever asks.

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,711
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

113
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,045
It was built by the gods, but its
contents are secret by design.

114
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,086
All we mortals know is that
we are not meant to know.

115
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,054
Why wouldn't they want
you to know what's inside?

116
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,887
Perhaps it is indeed the
lair of a horrifying monster.

117
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,292
Or perhaps they simply
enjoy tormenting those of us

118
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,627
who dedicate our lives
to cataloging information.

119
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,825
Well, whatever their motive,

120
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,959
we'd be idiots to
go in totally blind.

121
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,799
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

122
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,894
A god.

123
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,600
I believe your friends have
had encounters with them.

124
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,200
Now, there is another matter.

125
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,086
ALICE: That's the Siphon?

126
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,451
We thought it'd be bigger.

127
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,723
It needs to be powered,
and it requires a lot of energy.

128
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,061
Our intended source has not
fulfilled their end of our bargain.

129
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,466
Well, how am I
supposed to use it?

130
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,004
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

131
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,438
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

132
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,476
She'd never go for that if
she knew what this does.

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,907
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

134
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,250
That could kill her.

135
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,718
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

136
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,823
We need the Siphon
charged before...

137
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,919
I know.

138
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,525
Hmm.

139
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,601
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

140
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,138
I'll be in touch.

141
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,869
Remember.

142
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,846
Once magic is flowing again, you
have 30 seconds to attach the Siphon.

143
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,746
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

144
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,563
JOSH: I come bearing gifts.

145
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,398
This is, like, 80%
taco supplies.

146
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,268
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

147
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,808
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

148
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,242
No, no. If I have to
catch, pluck, or boil

149
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,440
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

150
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,248
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought I would be.

151
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,586
(SIGHS)

152
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,223
Listen, Fen.

153
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,057
Before you were born, you
were promised to a stranger.

154
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,152
A king.

155
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,498
And I'm not one anymore.

156
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,125
You don't have to
stay for my sake.

157
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm guessing you've never thought about
where I would be if you never showed up.

158
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,169
I have.

159
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,913
Still in that same
village where I was born,

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,940
married to one of the three
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

161
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,283
Now those boys want
to drop you off a waterfall,

162
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,323
and that's them being polite.

163
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,285
What do you think they would
do if they got their hands on me?

164
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,287
That got less
touching as you went.

165
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,799
I can't go back to my old life.

166
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,797
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

167
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,804
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

168
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,139
for the last key, but
this is what we got back.

169
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,320
Eat my ass! We're not sure if...

170
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,573
BUNNY: Eat my ass!

171
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,136
We're not sure
if... Eat. My. Ass!

172
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:39,311
If this was the Fairy Queen's
response or this is one very kinky rabbit.

173
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,083
Maybe there's something
we can do to get her attention?

174
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,646

176
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,460
FRAY: These are on the house.

177
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,894
For you saving my life.

178
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,261
We need to talk to your Queen.

179
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,129
You must know how
to get her to come.

180
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,065
It's an emergency. FRAY: No.

181
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,163
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

182
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,439
Glass half full. She didn't
actually go through with it.

183
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:06,344
But you must have fairy stepsisters
or someone you can talk to?

184
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,348
There were no fairy
children in the Realm.

185
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,977
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

186
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,816
Like me.

187
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,755
Being sent to you
ruined everything.

188
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,223
I can't go back to
the Fairy Realm,

189
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,520
I don't fit in with humans.

190
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,686
Why do you think I
work at an animal bar?

191
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,459
No, really, really,
I'm not judging you.

192
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,398
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

193
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:31,097
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

194
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,374
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked-up childhood.

195
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,103
But what we want
to offer the Queen

196
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,943
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

197
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,450
Maybe the distance between
us can finally start to close.

198
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,243
And maybe then, you
won't feel so alone.

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,948
That's kind.

200
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,584
But just so you
know, I'm not alone.

201
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,650
MARGO: No, really.

202
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,855
Bye, Margo.

203
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,399
Bye, Humbledrum.

204
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,497
I love that bear.

205
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,067
So do I.

206
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,974
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we
were kind of having a moment.

207
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:14,242
No, honey, she "loves" him.

208
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,890
Uh, so not bear
boss. Bear boyfriend?

209
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,924
Is that a thing in Fillory?

210
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,190
Apparently, very taboo.

211
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,461
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

212
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,436
if I got my way, I'd say go
hog-wild or bear-wild or bull-wild.

213
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,996
He's very concerned
about getting your approval.

214
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,532
I don't think he quite gets that
you're not even Fray's real dad.

215
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,847
Well, then...

216
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,916
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

217
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,616
I'm so happy
you're dating a bear.

218
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,927

00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,436
No problem.

ALICE: That's all
the Librarian knows.

223
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,300
We have to find someone
who's been inside the castle.

224
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,843
So...

225
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,879
A god. You say
that like it's easy.

226
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,314
Our Lady Underground
hasn't answered me in months.

227
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,580
Yeah, the only way to track
Bacchus down was his Instagram

228
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,986
and it looks like it got deleted
for terms of service violations.

229
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,455
Nipples, apparently.

230
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,923
Well, that's bullshit.

231
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,653
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

232
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,122
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

233
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,764
She's lying.

234
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,236
Not about the god
stuff, that's true.

235
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,672
It's what she's leaving out.

236
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,643
They have some sort of
metal thing called a "Siphon."

237
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,170
She's supposed to charge it
up by ripping out Julia's power,

238
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,876
which could kill her.

239
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,544
She didn't seem psyched about
the idea, but she didn't say no.

240
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,749
So, now what?

241
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,570
PENNY 23: What's
that? Truth Key?

242
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,242

you to go away.

to the other Penny.

No offense... You're
the "other Penny".

just trying to survive.

we could help him.

you did for the other me.

would have done that for me

258
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,634

You don't owe me anything.

264

But for what it's worth, it'd
be helpful if you explained it.

265

How she's different.

Our Lady gave to Julia.

what he's capable of.

he's still alive more than me.

at a complete standstill.

do is locate him,

All right, I'll get the
stuff for the locator.

that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

see them as equals.

00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,759
(BREATH TREMBLES)

695
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,821
JULIA: This is it.

696
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,030
The end of the story.

697
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,125
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

698
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,797
Q? What's up, what's wrong?

699
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,873
The quest is
supposed to change us.

700
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,175
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

701
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,806
up to this point,
and I... I can't...

702
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,646
You thought that
when you got here,

703
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,848
you'd be 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

704
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,784
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

705
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,589
Because you're
worried about your dad.

706
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,028
Party trick.

707
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,497
I just feel things.

708
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,802
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

709
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,430
Maybe...

710
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,771
I could heal your dad?

711
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,608
Right now, he's
perfectly healthy.

712
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,341
There's nothing to do.

713
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,143
If magic comes back,

714
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:17,713
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

715
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,349
I don't know if I'll be
able to help or not.

716
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,889
It's the deal.

717
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,024
Sorry it's vague.

718
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,059
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

719
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,234
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

720
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,544
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

721
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,557
Then the quest fucked up
when it chose Quentin Coldwater.

722
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,727
Maybe.

723
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,596
It's all real.

724
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,603
The Chatwins and Fillory.

725
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,438
I've been there.

726
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,210
I... I sat on a throne
in Whitespire, and I...

727
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,814
I explored the Flying Forest.

728
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,685
And I... Met Ember and Umber.

729
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,848
(CHUCKLES)

730
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,589
I remember reading
you those books.

731
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,462
Curly Q...

732
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,766
If all that's out there...

733
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,402
What are you doing here?

734
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,437
I'm on a quest.

735
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,639
TED: In New Jersey?

736
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,643
I have a problem.

737
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,174
And I don't know what to do.

738
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,341
No matter what choice I
make, somebody gets hurt.

739
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,080
Magic's gone.

740
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,448
Isn't it?

741
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,450
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

742
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,021
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

743
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,865
And I knew it
wasn't a coincidence

744
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,902
when I went into
remission a week later.

745
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,993
QUENTIN: You're right.

746
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,363
My friends and I
were trying to fix it.

747
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,203
And how's that been going?

748
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,475
We're getting really close.

749
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,044
So are you here to
ask my permission?

750
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,211
To...

751
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,389
Turn it back on?

752
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,984
On this quest...

753
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,388
I've lived a whole life.

754
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,168
I grew old, and I got
married. And I had a son.

755
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,806
Who grew old.

756
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,809
And what was all that
for if it's not for this?

757
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:02,047
No, I'm not here to
ask for your permission.

758
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,326
I wanted to look you in the eye

759
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,261
and tell you that I'm sorry.

760
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,258
I don't know what's
going to happen.

761
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,800
But I'm going to do this.

762
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,512
What was his name?

763
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,241
Your son.

764
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,752
I named him after you.
