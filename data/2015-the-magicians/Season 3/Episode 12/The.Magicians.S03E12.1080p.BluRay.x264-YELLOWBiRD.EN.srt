1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:04,035
<i>Previously on</i> "Us"...

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:07,030
- What?
- Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:10,401
<i>A group of fine looking
grad students</i>

4
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:13,266
<i>were invited
to a secret school for magic</i>

5
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,691
<i>where a bunch of stuff
happened</i>

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,152
<i>that doesn't really matter,</i>

7
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,177
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

8
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,462
The answer to a riddle they
didn't even know to ask.

9
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,960
- It's you.
- Do you want this recap or not?

10
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:28,553
So yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,222
<i>For a minute.
We became kings and queens.</i>

12
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,324
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

13
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:37,275
<i>Everyone hooked up,
I had a threesome with two harpies.</i>

14
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,454
Just get to the parts about me.

15
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:42,789
<i>You had a lot of drama
with your hands.</i>

16
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:46,173
<i>You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library</i>

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,144
- <i>to help out Kady.</i>
- Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:52,607
<i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:54,185
<i>Looks like she could
crack open your balls,</i>

20
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,446
<i>because she can?</i>

21
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:58,376
<i>Well, it was a love for
the ages.</i>

22
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

23
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:03,793
<i>with some hedge witches.
Especially her best bitch,</i>

24
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,916
<i>Julia Wicker.
Their term, not mine.</i>

25
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:08,700
- I-I-I would never.
- Whatever went down

26
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:11,524
definitely made them ex-best...

27
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:13,678
Witches. Truthfully,

28
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:15,626
the only person
Kady can stand is you.

29
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,769
And that pretty much cut
both ways.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,937
No, come on, Penny,
don't... don't... Come on.

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,471
<i>And then you died.
Kind of.</i>

32
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:26,665
Meanwhile,
magic got all jacked up.

33
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:29,514
You know what's weird,
that jacked up is bad,

34
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:33,308
- but jacked off is great.
- Focus, dude.

35
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:36,487
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of Fairy dicks

36
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,962
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,843
<i>so the people revolted.
Only ray of hope?</i>

38
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,353
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

39
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,365
Why? Question mark!

40
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,167
<i>We got sent
on a dope quest</i>

41
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,725
<i>to find the Seven Keys
that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,587
<i>But the fourth one got dragon gobbled</i>

43
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,459
<i>and lost in the Underworld.</i>

44
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,341
The other Penny sent us the key,

45
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:59,310
<i>but never came back.</i>

46
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:03,190
- Then came my grand adventure.
- Hard pass.

47
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,113
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

48
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,966
- And snagged up Key seven.
- Yeah, I was there for that.

49
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:10,303
And you didn't save shit.

50
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,962
Now wait,
you skipped the Sixth Key.

51
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:14,733
This makes no goddamn sense.

52
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,495
No, it's intentionally confusing.

53
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:20,932
<i>You see, Julia saved a bunch
of Fairies from slavery,</i>

54
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,668
<i>So the Fairy Queen was
like, I have the Sixth Key,</i>

55
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:26,309
<i>but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's...</i>

56
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,973
A creamy bitch is what she is.

57
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,960
<i>Meanwhile, Alice has
been acting real fishy.</i>

58
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:32,891
Quentin was all like...

59
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,923
Are you working for the Library?

60
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:35,345
- And she was all...
- Yes.

61
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,464
<i>And now,
if you would please refer</i>

62
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,201
<i>to the hookup/murder chart.</i>

63
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,762
Penny got with the other Alice.

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,340
- Interesting.
- Now that we know

65
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:49,015
who porked whom,
let's go over who murdered whom.

66
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,184
Penny.

67
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,335
You're Kady.

68
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,958
- What's going on?
- I'm not your Penny.

69
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:24,562
Julia?

70
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:26,902
- Sorry, uh, what?
- What I'm saying is,

71
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:28,489
if there's a monster
behind the door,

72
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,568
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

73
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:32,067
But that's where magic is, like...

74
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:35,487
what, we can't exactly just stop.
Plus, this didn't come

75
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,706
- from the most reliable source.
- He was you.

76
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,778
- He was the Beast.
- Making decisions like this

77
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:42,586
without understanding the consequences

78
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,981
is exactly why magic is gone.

79
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,362
So we figure out if it's true.

80
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:51,272
We... we search the castle,
find out what's inside.

81
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:54,109
We could ask the Library.

82
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:58,759
Yeah, you're right. You should ask them.

83
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,008
They say they want to help.

84
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:01,863
It'd be nice if they actually did.

85
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,436
I'll let you know what they say.

86
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:08,942
Q...

87
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:12,727
Do you have a better plan?

88
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:14,644
Yeah, maybe don't trust the Library?

89
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,966
They literally snort
the bones of Fairies.

90
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:18,295
We don't have to trust them.

91
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:20,115
The... Penny that
you brought with you,

92
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,218
- The...
- Penny 23.

93
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:24,241
Yeah, look.
Ask him to follow Alice

94
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,291
to the Library.
He can Astral Project,

95
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:27,966
they'll never even know he was there.

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,935
Catching up on the news?

97
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,235
My timeline was post apocalyptic,

98
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,376
and it wasn't this fucked up.

99
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,689
Alice is meeting with the Library.

100
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:46,077
We need you to follow
her on the Astral Plane.

101
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,448
Q thinks you're more
likely to say yes if I ask,

102
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:52,198
because you and the
other me shared a thing.

103
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,759
But we both know that
we're total strangers.

104
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,314
- So...
- Go on.

105
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,414
Well see, this is a
chance to un-fuck magic.

106
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,128
And as a new citizen of
Timeline 40,

107
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,031
that should be something
you would want to do.

108
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,200
Whoever asks.

109
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:12,585
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

110
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,548
It was built by the
gods, but its contents

111
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:17,330
are secret by design.
All we mortals know

112
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,043
is that we are not
meant to know.

113
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,976
Why wouldn't they want
you to know what's inside?

114
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,130
Perhaps it is indeed the
lair of a horrifying monster.

115
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,318
Or perhaps they simply
enjoy tormenting those of us

116
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:31,513
who dedicate our lives to
cataloguing information.

117
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:32,915
Well whatever their motive,

118
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,941
we'd be idiots to go in
totally blind.

119
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:36,826
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

120
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,045
A god. I believe your friends

121
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:43,512
have had encounters with them.
Now, there is another matter.

122
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,208
That's the Siphon?

123
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,244
We thought it'd be bigger.

124
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:01,427
It needs to be powered, and
it requires a lot of energy.

125
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,397
Our intended source has not fulfilled

126
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,370
their end of our bargain.

127
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,351
Well, how are we supposed to use it?

128
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,472
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

129
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,744
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

130
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:16,636
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

131
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:20,117
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

132
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,724
That could kill her.

133
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:28,936
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

134
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,850
We need the Siphon charged before...

135
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,681
I know.

136
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:44,245
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

137
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,631
- I'll be in touch.
- Remember.

138
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,954
Once magic is flowing again,

139
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,802
you have 30 seconds
to attach the Siphon.

140
00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:58,478
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

141
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,754
<i>I come bearing gifts.</i>

142
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,500
This is like,
80% taco supplies.

143
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,426
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

144
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,737
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

145
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,352
No, no, if I have to
catch, pluck, or boil

146
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,628
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

147
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,435
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought it would be.

148
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:39,243
Listen, Fen.

149
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:41,194
Before you were born, you were promised

150
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,545
to a stranger. A king.

151
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:46,315
And... I'm not one
anymore.

152
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:49,374
You don't have to stay for my sake.

153
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:52,434
I'm guessing
you've never thought about

154
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,723
where I would be
if you never showed up.

155
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,517
I have.

156
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,877
Still in that same
village where I was born,

157
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,895
married to one of the three

158
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,874
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

159
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,546
Now those boys
want to drop you off a waterfall,

160
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:09,619
and that's them being polite.

161
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:13,395
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

162
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,370
That got less touching as you went.

163
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,034
I can't go back to my old life.

164
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:24,458
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

165
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,599
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

166
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:30,018
for the last Key,
but this is what we got back.

167
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,607
- Eat my ass!
- We're not sure if...

168
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:32,706
Eat my ass!

169
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:34,568
- Eat. My. Ass!
- We're not sure if...

170
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:37,027
If this was
the Fairy Queen's response

171
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:39,371
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

172
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:41,978
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

173
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:44,106
<i>Eat. My. Ass.</i>

174
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:49,834
These are on the house.
For you saving my life.

175
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,336
We need to talk to your Queen.

176
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,272
You must know
how to get her to come.

177
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,174
- It's an emergency.
- No.

178
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:59,193
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

179
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,649
Glass half full... she didn't
actually go through with it.

180
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,575
But you must have
Fairy stepsisters

181
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,385
or someone you can talk to?

182
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:08,661
There were no Fairy
children in the realm.

183
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,067
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

184
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,678
Like me.

185
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,737
Being sent to you ruined everything.

186
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,319
I can't go back to the Fairy Realm.

187
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:20,332
I don't fit in with
humans. Why do you think

188
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,069
- I work at an animal bar?
- No, really,

189
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,778
really, I'm not judging you.

190
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:27,558
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

191
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:31,316
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

192
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:34,468
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked up childhood.

193
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,298
But what we want
to offer the Queen

194
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:39,984
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

195
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:43,915
Maybe the distance between
us can finally start to close.

196
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:47,515
And maybe then, you won't feel so alone.

197
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,191
That's kind.

198
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,298
But just so you know, I'm not alone.

199
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:55,340
No, really.

200
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,812
Bye, Margo.

201
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,599
Bye, Humbledrum.

202
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,506
I love that bear.

203
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,303
So do I.

204
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,307
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we were

205
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,707
- kind of having a moment.
- No, honey,

206
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,174
she <i>loves</i> him.

207
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:24,218
Uh, so not bear boss.
Bear boyfriend?

208
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:30,425
- Is that a thing in Fillory?
- Apparently, very taboo.

209
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:33,668
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

210
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:36,030
if I got my way,
I'd say go hog wild

211
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,759
or bear wild or bull wild.

212
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,054
He's very concerned about
getting your approval.

213
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,471
I don't think he quite gets

214
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,740
that you're not even Fray's real dad.

215
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,511
Well, then...

216
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:53,460
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

217
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm so happy you're dating a bear.

218
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:04,036
Thanks...

219
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:05,521
Dad.

220
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,735
<i>Thanks, Fray's dad.</i>

221
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,556
No problem.

222
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,186
<i>That's all the Librarian knows.</i>

223
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:15,589
We have to find somebody
who's been inside the Castle.

224
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:16,911
So...

225
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,590
A God. You say that like it's easy.

226
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,435
Our Lady Underground hasn't
answered me in months.

227
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,701
Yeah, the only way
to track Bacchus down

228
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,678
was his Instagram, and
it looks like it got deleted

229
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,781
for terms of service violations.

230
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,905
- Nipples, apparently.
- Well, that's bullshit.

231
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,081
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

232
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:37,849
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

233
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,147
She's lying.

234
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,364
Not about the God stuff,
that's true.

235
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:47,874
It's what she's leaving out.

236
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:50,304
They have some sort of metal thing

237
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,530
called a Siphon. She's
supposed to charge it up

238
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:57,041
by ripping out Julia's
power, which could kill her.

239
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,044
She didn't seem psyched
about the idea,

240
00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:00,768
but she didn't say no.

241
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,081
So, now what?

242
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,134
What's that? Truth Key?

243
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,781
If it was,
I'd tell you to go away.

244
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,949
Unity.

245
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:28,221
The walkie-talkie key.

246
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,509
You're trying to talk
to the other Penny.

247
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:35,506
No offense...
you're the <i>other</i> Penny.

248
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:39,733
Look.

249
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:45,174
I don't blame you. You're
just trying to survive.

250
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:48,798
It's... it's everyone else.

251
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,484
Acting like finding you is enough.

252
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:56,314
When our Penny, the real Penny,

253
00:12:56,573 --> 00:13:00,015
is out there. Down there.

254
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,384
And... maybe if...

255
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:07,309
we talk to him,
we could help him.

256
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,520
- Oh, what?
- Just...

257
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:16,374
all that shit that you
did for the other me.

258
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,899
The only person that
would have done that for me

259
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:22,039
on my timeline is
Julia.

260
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:26,186
Yeah, well...

261
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,871
our Julia is different.

262
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:33,733
She is not the person you loved.

263
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,769
You don't owe me anything.

264
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,619
But for what it's worth,

265
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,997
it'd be helpful if you explained it.

266
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,476
How she's different.

267
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,587
What about Reynard?

268
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:04,331
What happened to him
after O.L.U. took him away?

269
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,229
I don't know.

270
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:10,440
But it was his spark that
Our Lady gave to Julia.

271
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:12,972
And now it's not about me.

272
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:16,215
None of it ever really felt about me.

273
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:21,030
So I've, uh...

274
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,231
never really known how to deal

275
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,733
with how angry I am at all of it.

276
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,951
Wait, so he could be out there?

277
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:33,320
Still a god, but powerless?

278
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,228
I guess.

279
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,111
And only gods know
what's behind the door.

280
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,439
No.

281
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,469
We have to find Reynard.

282
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:59,517
Thank you for coming.
I actually have

283
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,977
nothing to say to you.

284
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:02,742
I know what you want.

285
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:06,564
- And I can't give it to you.
- We get it.

286
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:09,208
Humans will chop you up
and snort your innards.

287
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,516
But not all humans are
like that, you know that.

288
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:14,778
- We aren't.
- I told Julia about our Key

289
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,083
to give you all a chance
to give up on your quest.

290
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,128
We aren't questing,
we are surrendering.

291
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:21,358
We are giving you
what you want...

292
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,524
A nice, quiet,
moist as hell spot

293
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:25,503
on Fillory for you to settle.

294
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,610
And you give us the Key.

295
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:30,192
Or... I walk away.

296
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,818
And when the Lorians,
Floaters, and Western Hordes

297
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,221
are done with Fillory, I can take it.

298
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:37,755
All of it.

299
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:41,160
Our lifespans dwarf even the dwarves.

300
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,903
We can wait for what we want.

301
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,796
Oh, but you can't, can you?

302
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:50,579
You see, Fray,
well, she told us

303
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,089
that there are no Fairy
children in your realm.

304
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:56,562
So... that's a prob.

305
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,268
That's why you planted your eggs

306
00:15:58,337 --> 00:15:59,834
in the Northern Orchard, isn't it?

307
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:01,955
You can't reproduce
in the Fairy Realm.

308
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,267
Without Fillory, you go extinct.

309
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,836
Fine, ignore the problem.

310
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,273
Your egg hole's only
getting dustier.

311
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:13,014
You no longer speak for
the people of Fillory.

312
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,651
Tick Pickwick does.

313
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:18,282
And he has no interest in a deal.

314
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,699
If you want my Key,
come back with a crown.

315
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,749
Or an army.

316
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:33,472
I pray to you,
Our Lady Underground.

317
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,953
Please don't be
withholding for once.

318
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,721
<i>- God damn it!</i>
- Hello?

319
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,800
Dean Fogg?

320
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,349
Were you talking in here?

321
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,250
No, I was not, why?

322
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:59,885
I, um, I woke up this morning

323
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,193
with this ringing in my ears.

324
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,854
You should get that checked.

325
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:07,619
By someone who isn't me.
But it's not just that.

326
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:11,536
I can feel what other
people are feeling.

327
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:16,303
You were given the power of a god.

328
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:20,728
Spiritual people might say
that you're hearing prayers.

329
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,321
I heard you.

330
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,808
I felt something coming from you.

331
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:30,271
What, exactly?

332
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:31,566
Desperation.

333
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:32,723
Oh.

334
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,772
Look, I think that I'm
supposed to help you...

335
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,822
No, I do not need your help.

336
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:39,654
Yes, you do.

337
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,999
- Your eyes...
- Were injured magically,

338
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:44,746
and fixing them with
magic risks changing

339
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,949
the very core of who I am.
Do you understand?

340
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,433
Yes.

341
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:53,597
If you did it, or another Magician.

342
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,290
But that's... not what I am, exactly.

343
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,971
If I'm hearing prayers, I'm supposed

344
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,131
to do something about them.
Why give me this otherwise?

345
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,333
You know, I put a little
leftover pigeon in my taco,

346
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:53,884
and it's really...

347
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,607
really bad.

348
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:58,848
We need the Key
to get back magic.

349
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,891
We need our thrones
to get the Key.

350
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,178
We need magic to get our thrones.

351
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,705
It is an ouroboros of ass.

352
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,685
Maybe King Idri
and the Stone Queen

353
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:10,326
will back our claims.
We defeat Tick's army,

354
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:12,736
- storm the castle...
- Yes, and,

355
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:15,415
what if we replace the part
where we kill everyone with...

356
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:17,841
Oh, off the top of my head...
democracy?

357
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,492
Like we were going to do
before magic got borked?

358
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,433
Tick's the only one who
can call for an election,

359
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,399
and he's got nothing to gain.

360
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,784
Oh, he'll call for it, all right.

361
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,548
Josh, I need you to go to Kinko's.

362
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,522
<i>Election? What is this?</i>

363
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:38,645
There are thousands of them.
They were falling from the sky.

364
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:42,172
Over villages, farms, a brothel...

365
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:45,885
I... happened to...
be walking by.

366
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:47,695
Collect them all and
burn them.

367
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,634
Of course,
your grumpiness.

368
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:54,012
But as Abigail wisely
reminded me,

369
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,641
the citizens now believe
they're getting elections.

370
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,229
You'd have to be the one
to announce they're not.

371
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,778
Given the
revolutionary mood

372
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,772
the people have been in
recently...

373
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,228
Your plan worked.

374
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,979
Tick already started putting
up his own campaign flyers.

375
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,830
Of course it worked.
Giving people shit is easy.

376
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:15,032
Taking it away is almost
impossible.

377
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,922
Like Obamacare.

378
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,791
Or herpes. Too true, Bambi.

379
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,996
Speaking of difficult conversations

380
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:26,108
with a former lover,
do you have a second?

381
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:28,756
Why the fuck shouldn't
my name be on that ballot?

382
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,588
Because we are running
for king.

383
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:32,765
We can call the job whatever
we want after we win it.

384
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,942
It has been a struggle
to bring this place

385
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:37,420
into the 20th century. - Yes, 20th,

386
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,504
because when we got here,
it was straight up Dark Ages,

387
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,838
and we have to start somewhere.

388
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,608
Yeah, we're really civilizing them.

389
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,881
What should we teach them
next? To outlaw abortion?

390
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,089
Women don't want to work?
Wage gaps? Thigh gaps?

391
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,775
Fillory is patriarchal.

392
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,453
And we've got to put
our best foot forward.

393
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:54,661
And I'm sorry,
but in this case,

394
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,743
our foot should have a dick.

395
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,281
What, Josh?

396
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:05,466
Do you have some patronizing
bullshit to tell me, too?

397
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:08,636
No, uh, could you drop me
off at the Earth portal tree?

398
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,560
- I have an idea, but I need...
- Me?

399
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,858
- How did you...
- Yeah, I have no idea.

400
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:19,410
Hi, Margo.
I felt you needed my help.

401
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,899
And now I'm here.
It's been a weird day.

402
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,855
Can't believe I did this.

403
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:30,140
This forest fed so many people.

404
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:31,676
Not for nothing,

405
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,782
but when I was at my lowest point,

406
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:35,998
that tiny spell you showed me,

407
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,327
it's what got me back in the fight.

408
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:42,870
Magic is the thing that makes
the children of Earth special.

409
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:45,379
All I'm asking is, try.

410
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:44,388
Vote Children of Earth.

411
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:48,156
Vote Children of Earth.

412
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,785
Vote the Children of Earth!

413
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,092
<i>Step right up, grab a poster.</i>

414
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:09,866
We need to talk.

415
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,941
- Look, Quentin...
- What is a Siphon?

416
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,183
And why do you need Julia to power it?

417
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,187
- You spied on me?
- What does it do?

418
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,260
It's a safeguard. That's all.

419
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,029
The Library wants to turn magic back on.

420
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:26,643
And once it's back on,
they want to make sure

421
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,154
it doesn't get used
for the wrong things

422
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:31,326
- by the wrong people.
- So, the Siphon diverts

423
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:35,759
magic to the Library so that
they can choose who can use it?

424
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,954
Look, you took a test
to get into Brakebills.

425
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:42,205
If you failed, you would
have gotten sent away,

426
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,516
with no memory of
magic. Happily ignorant.

427
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:47,852
But because a group of smart individuals

428
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:51,546
made a judgment call, they let you in.

429
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,787
Why should the Library get to choose?

430
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,581
They're corrupt, they're killers.

431
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,337
Yeah, so are we.

432
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:01,027
At least they have the information,

433
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,057
the perspective.

434
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:05,545
You love magic, and you're probably

435
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,229
the best there is at it.

436
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:10,589
You're terrified of
what you'll do with it.

437
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,779
- I have reason to be.
- I don't know everything

438
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,919
that you did as a niffin, but
I know that people make mistakes

439
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,424
so that they can change
and do better.

440
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,665
But only if they're given the chance.

441
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:24,880
Taking away choice is not the answer.

442
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,404
There are seven Keys, and
we have eight questers.

443
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,685
We can do this without you, and we will.

444
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:34,841
Unless you give me the Siphon.

445
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,960
Just remember that when
magic was turned off,

446
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:57,052
your dad went into remission, Q.

447
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,132
And once you turn it back
on, his cancer comes back,

448
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:01,962
and he dies.

449
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:11,463
Straw polls are in, and
our ratings are way up.

450
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:14,780
I mean, off the charts.
Julia has done us

451
00:25:14,857 --> 00:25:17,124
the solidest solid.
After the trees,

452
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,188
she grew food for the
starving peasants.

453
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,705
She fixed the dry wells.

454
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:24,096
She even helped this one guy's
bajanked case of head lice.

455
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:28,610
I mean, Children of
Earth are back on top!

456
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,767
Her Flealessness suggests
that your time as High King

457
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:37,715
has been so brief, the Fillorian people

458
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,742
don't yet know what you stand for.

459
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:43,895
I stand for them. I stand
for economic stability.

460
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:47,632
For a solid,
well-researched strategy.

461
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,769
That's it.

462
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:52,839
I'm going to tell them,
in detail, my plan.

463
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,257
Rafe, write this down.

464
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,756
My fellow Fillorians, I hereby set forth

465
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:03,829
my policy to restore
economic and societal growth

466
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,595
<i>to a reunified Fillory...</i>

467
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:10,367
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So uninspiring.

468
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:14,246
Does he really think he can
win by boring them to death?

469
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:16,049
Josh!

470
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,445
I hereby declare
all native Fillorians

471
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:22,087
shall receive ten free
sacks of grain every year.

472
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,723
And how exactly are
we supposed to

473
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,155
grow that much grain,
even with magic?

474
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:28,935
You're making a promise
you can't keep.

475
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,811
Bambi, first rule of
politics on Earth...

476
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:35,061
<i>All you have to do is say it.
It doesn't have to be true.</i>

477
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:39,612
I hereby declare,
under my administration,

478
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,434
<i>low-interest loans for
all new infrastructure.</i>

479
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:44,467
Easy. No-interest loans.

480
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,195
<i>And we're going to
build Fillory's first...</i>

481
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,416
Power... plants.

482
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:52,103
Like, Geraniums?

483
00:26:53,072 --> 00:26:57,068
Will Tick's granular policies
keep you warm at night?

484
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:59,085
<i>No, you know what will?</i>

485
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:01,264
<i>Extending the Fillorian summer.</i>

486
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:03,501
My proposition for
growth in new sectors...

487
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:05,538
- Free healthcare for all!
- Based on rigorous

488
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,767
- rigorous survey research...
- Champagne fountains

489
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,845
- in every village.
- The abatement of dependency

490
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:11,891
- on the Golden Goose standard.
- Wealth!

491
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,632
<i>Regulation of
agricultural waste</i>

492
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,368
<i>to prevent
environmental runoff.</i>

493
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,257
- Feasts.
- Annual famine

494
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,744
- and rampant poverty.
- Boat parties!

495
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,705
Three cheers for Eliot!

496
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:24,273
- Hooray, hooray, hooray!
- Hooray, hooray, hooray!

497
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:28,030
- Eliot, I am so sorry.
- What is it?

498
00:27:28,183 --> 00:27:31,224
Tick's campaign just leaked
the transcript from your trial.

499
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,071
You mean the one
where he called Fillory

500
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:34,822
a malodorous shithole?

501
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,207
<i>It's already hit the Posts.</i>

502
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,497
Son of a Pickwick.

503
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,510
Julia, what the fuck...

504
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:51,348
There's a little boy in Syracuse.

505
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,765
I can feel his parents
praying.

506
00:27:55,988 --> 00:28:00,485
I know if I just focus enough,
I can bring down his fever.

507
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:05,276
I feel bad interrupting this.

508
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,039
But we need your help
with something.

509
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:10,509
Finding Reynard.

510
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,623
I know.

511
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:16,149
But we need to talk to a god.

512
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:19,145
- I want to help you, but...
- Julia.

513
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,767
You have all the power now.

514
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:24,373
Yeah, but he's still a trickster.

515
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:26,749
We don't know what he's capable of.

516
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:32,015
Look, nobody hates that he's
still alive more than me.

517
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,415
But if we don't do it...

518
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,586
we're at a complete standstill.

519
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,741
All you'd have to do is locate him,

520
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:45,824
power up Penny's tattoos,
and we'll take it from there.

521
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:47,627
You can also say no.

522
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,406
I'm not going to send you there alone.

523
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:55,986
Great.

524
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:58,604
All right, I'll get the
stuff for the locater.

525
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,220
There's no need.

526
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:03,446
I can feel him with my mind.

527
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:07,672
- You guys ready?
- Wait, what are you...

528
00:29:13,523 --> 00:29:17,318
This is the place.
He's nearby.

529
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:20,138
I have to say, this is
pretty disappointing.

530
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,870
Yeah.

531
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:24,333
We were all kind of
hoping to find Reynard

532
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:26,302
showering in a Russian prison.

533
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,874
Oh, shit.

534
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:49,020
Roxanne Gay,
Bell hooks, feminist lit?

535
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:53,060
What, are you saving these for
a rapist book burning party?

536
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:54,923
I've changed.

537
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,523
Living amongst the humans

538
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,219
has given me a whole new perspective.

539
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,724
You're still a liar and pathetic,

540
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:04,257
but I guess you always were.

541
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,151
Why are you here?

542
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:11,482
What could I have that
you could possibly want?

543
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:14,149
Let's talk about the Castle
at the End of the World.

544
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,373
What's inside?

545
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:18,222
How do you guys know about that place?

546
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:20,143
Answer her question.

547
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:22,028
You're not thinking of
going there, are you?

548
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:24,560
You know there's a reason
the gods had the Architect

549
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:27,759
- put it at the end of the world?
- The Architect?

550
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,423
It's not for you little guys
to know.

551
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,654
It's funny...

552
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,316
'cause from where I stand,
you're the little guy now.

553
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,399
You have all my power, and look at you.

554
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,506
Trying to handle something
you cannot handle.

555
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,984
You should have kept your mouth
shut and stayed in your place.

556
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:49,164
You've gotten yourself
into some real trouble now.

557
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:51,285
You think it's easy being a god?

558
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,433
You feel that?

559
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:59,864
Your... tiny... spark

560
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:05,848
has grown bigger in me than
it could have ever in you.

561
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:09,173
You want the truth about the Castle?

562
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,911
The Castle's where the gods put
the stuff they made before us.

563
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,717
The stuff that didn't
work out.

564
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:16,352
Mistakes that never
should have happened.

565
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:18,649
Kinda like you.
I hope you do go.

566
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,018
Open that door,
see what happens!

567
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:25,652
No!

568
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,207
Recognize it?

569
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,185
Yeah.

570
00:31:42,908 --> 00:31:47,078
I made it to kill him.
How did you get this?

571
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,304
Did Our Lady give it to you?

572
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:52,327
Of course not.

573
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:54,611
My mother left me here
\to rot.

574
00:31:54,824 --> 00:31:57,061
My stepfather Hades was the
only one that took pity on me.

575
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:00,038
He slipped me that gun to shoot
myself in case of emergency.

576
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:01,558
I'm still a god.

577
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:04,041
Limp or not,
we're hard to kill.

578
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:11,592
What are you willing to
bet this god killing bullet

579
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:14,083
will work on the monster in the Castle?

580
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:17,707
The fate of the world?

581
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,416
That's good enough for me.

582
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,030
Whoa, that's it?

583
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:26,955
You're just going
to leave him there?

584
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,507
After what he did to the
both of you?

585
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:31,923
Shoot him.

586
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,036
Kady, you wanted this.

587
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:39,230
I wanted him to be
punished for what he did.

588
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:46,261
And he is. Leave him here.

589
00:32:57,107 --> 00:33:00,721
I am here to deliver the
official election results.

590
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,034
Eliot has lost.

591
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,052
Shocker.

592
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:10,285
Uh, Tick has also lost.

593
00:33:10,414 --> 00:33:11,686
Um, what?

594
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,790
Our new High King...

595
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,341
is Margo.

596
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:23,997
But I wa...
I wasn't even on the ballot.

597
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,669
- You won as a write in.
- Who wrote me in?

598
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:29,393
The talking animals.

599
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,508
It seems you were the only
human on the campaign trail

600
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:35,004
who stopped to listen
to their concerns.

601
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:37,378
You mean that drunk bear?

602
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,848
Humbledrum is a highly respected

603
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,790
member of the community.
You see, there are certain

604
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:47,310
taboo subjects
you broached with him.

605
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,414
Bestiality?

606
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:51,345
The talking animals believe

607
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,495
that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

608
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:56,498
then humans will finally
see them as equals.

609
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,822
None of us were brave
enough to speak out

610
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:02,470
in support of the cause,
until you.

611
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,675
You really love that sloth,
don't you?

612
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,338
So the human vote basically
means nothing in Fillory.

613
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:16,618
Considering there's
never been an election

614
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,548
or census before, we had no idea

615
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:21,235
there were only 50,000
humans in Fillory,

616
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,793
and upwards of a
million talking animals.

617
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,974
So... yes.

618
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:33,136
On behalf of Abigail,
let me be the first

619
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,443
to swear loyalty to
the new administration.

620
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:40,635
El...

621
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm so sorry.

622
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,368
And allow me to be the second.

623
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,413
High King Margo.
Long may you reign.

624
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,807
Hey, Tick.

625
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,565
I intend to choose Death
by a Thousand Pokes.

626
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,235
They say you only feel
the first hundred or so.

627
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:52,180
Tick, we're not going to
execute you.

628
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,469
If you proved anything
during your campaign,

629
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:58,053
it's that Fillory needs
a policy wonk like you.

630
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,579
You're still bitch listed, but...

631
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:03,625
King Margo
would like you in her cabinet.

632
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,524
With a full 24-hour security detail

633
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,295
watching everything you do.

634
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:12,561
We don't trust you,
but we need you.

635
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:22,210
Citizenship for every Fairy,
full protection of the law,

636
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,169
and a seat in the government.
But we need the Key.

637
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,885
And you shall have it.

638
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,018
Once the last Fairies have
been moved to our new home.

639
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:34,131
I always saw something in you.

640
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:37,725
Even when you didn't see it in yourself.

641
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:41,876
Now, perhaps you will.

642
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:53,691
You gave me...

643
00:36:54,698 --> 00:36:57,473
I can... I can see all sorts of things.

644
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,365
It's a Fairy eye.
A gift you will learn

645
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:03,383
to understand in time.

646
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,544
But one you must hide
in plain sight.

647
00:37:10,643 --> 00:37:13,140
Could I maybe get some Fairy toes?

648
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:15,047
Hello?

649
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:34,000
<i>- It's cranky as shit.
- Just take a little</i>

650
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,378
<i>- off the top.
- I just collapsed</i>

651
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,648
<i>my entire rental.</i>

652
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:39,097
<i>- Last time, we were...
- Oh, my God...</i>

653
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:40,495
<i>Are we supposed to sing again?</i>

654
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:42,443
<i>- Holy shit, no.
- We've got news!</i>

655
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:44,276
- Penny, is that you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

656
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,980
<i>We just got the last
Key from the Fairies.</i>

657
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:49,016
Okay, everyone just shut up!
It's Penny.

658
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:50,327
All right, look, listen.

659
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:52,142
I-I don't know how much time we have.

660
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,628
<i>- Kady.</i>
- But I'm going to get you out

661
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:56,222
of the Underworld, no matter
what it takes, I promise.

662
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:58,562
<i>- Kady.</i>
- I love you.

663
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,975
This is Penny 23.

664
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:05,948
The Key replaced my Penny with you.

665
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:09,185
Look, I'm really sorry.

666
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,544
This is it.

667
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,496
The end of the story.

668
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:22,602
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

669
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:26,163
Q? What's up,
what's wrong?

670
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:32,926
The quest is supposed to change us.

671
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:35,247
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

672
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:37,522
up to this point,
and I-I... I can't...

673
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,694
You thought that
when you got here,

674
00:38:39,763 --> 00:38:44,141
you'd be... 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

675
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:47,455
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

676
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,810
Because you're worried
about your dad.

677
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:53,374
Party trick.

678
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:56,583
I just feel things.

679
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,593
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

680
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,725
- Maybe...
- I could heal your dad?

681
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,661
Right now, he's perfectly healthy.

682
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,906
There's nothing to do.

683
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:12,980
If magic comes back,

684
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:17,381
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

685
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:20,473
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

686
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,214
It's the deal.

687
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,431
Sorry it's vague.

688
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:39,267
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

689
00:39:41,898 --> 00:39:45,451
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

690
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:54,556
Then the quest fucked up when
it chose Quentin Coldwater.

691
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:57,383
Maybe.

692
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:05,154
It's all real.

693
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:10,423
The Chatwins and Fillory.

694
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:14,745
I've been there. I
s... I sat on a throne

695
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,525
in Whitespire, and I...

696
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,934
I explored the Flying Forest.

697
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,828
And I... met
Ember and Umber.

698
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:29,151
I remember reading you
those books.

699
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:31,953
Curly Q...

700
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:35,163
if all that's out there...

701
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,882
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on a quest.

702
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,569
In New Jersey?

703
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,271
I have a problem.

704
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,561
And I don't know what to do.

705
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:53,953
No matter what choice I
make, somebody gets hurt.

706
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,869
Magic's gone.

707
00:40:57,728 --> 00:40:58,998
Isn't it?

708
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,820
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

709
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:05,457
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

710
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:07,873
And I knew it wasn't a
coincidence

711
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:10,836
when... I went into remission
a week later.

712
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:14,690
You're right. My friends
and I were trying to fix it.

713
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:18,684
- And how's that been going?
- We're getting really close.

714
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,957
So are you here to ask my permission?

715
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,847
To...

716
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,668
turn it back on?

717
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:37,690
On this quest...

718
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:40,582
I've lived a whole life.

719
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:48,089
I grew old, and I got
married. And I had a son.

720
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:50,346
Who grew old.

721
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:54,525
And what was all that
for if it's not for this?

722
00:41:57,878 --> 00:42:02,147
No, I'm not here to
ask for your permission.

723
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:09,613
I wanted to look you in the eye

724
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:12,958
and tell you that I'm sorry.

725
00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:16,779
I don't know what's going to happen.

726
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,022
But I'm going to do this.

727
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:29,123
What was his name?

728
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:31,966
Your son.

729
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:34,691
I named him after you.
