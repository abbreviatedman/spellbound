1
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:09,835
<i>Previously on</i> "Us"...

2
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:12,830
- What?
- Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:16,201
<i>A group of fine looking
grad students</i>

4
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:19,066
<i>were invited
to a secret school for magic</i>

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,491
<i>where a bunch of stuff
happened</i>

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,952
<i>that doesn't really matter,</i>

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,977
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

8
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:28,262
The answer to a riddle they
didn't even know to ask.

9
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:30,760
- It's you.
- Do you want this recap or not?

10
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:34,353
So yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,022
<i>For a minute.
We became kings and queens.</i>

12
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,124
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

13
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:43,075
<i>Everyone hooked up,
I had a threesome with two harpies.</i>

14
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,254
Just get to the parts about me.

15
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,589
<i>You had a lot of drama
with your hands.</i>

16
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:51,973
<i>You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library</i>

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,944
- <i>to help out Kady.</i>
- Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,407
<i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:58,494 --> 00:00:59,985
<i>Looks like she could
crack open your balls,</i>

20
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,246
<i>because she can?</i>

21
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,176
<i>Well, it was a love for
the ages.</i>

22
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,319
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

23
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:09,593
<i>with some hedge witches.
Especially her best bitch,</i>

24
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,716
<i>Julia Wicker.
Their term, not mine.</i>

25
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:14,500
- I-I-I would never.
- Whatever went down

26
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:17,324
definitely made them ex-best...

27
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,478
Witches. Truthfully,

28
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,426
the only person
Kady can stand is you.

29
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,569
And that pretty much cut
both ways.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,737
No, come on, Penny,
don't... don't... Come on.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,271
<i>And then you died.
Kind of.</i>

32
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:32,465
Meanwhile,
magic got all jacked up.

33
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:35,314
You know what's weird,
that jacked up is bad,

34
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:39,108
- but jacked off is great.
- Focus, dude.

35
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:42,287
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of Fairy dicks

36
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:45,762
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,643
<i>so the people revolted.
Only ray of hope?</i>

38
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:51,153
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

39
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:53,165
Why? Question mark!

40
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:54,967
<i>We got sent
on a dope quest</i>

41
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,525
<i>to find the Seven Keys
that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:59,387
<i>But the fourth one got dragon gobbled</i>

43
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:01,259
<i>and lost in the Underworld.</i>

44
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,141
The other Penny sent us the key,

45
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:05,110
<i>but never came back.</i>

46
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:08,990
- Then came my grand adventure.
- Hard pass.

47
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:11,913
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

48
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,766
- And snagged up Key seven.
- Yeah, I was there for that.

49
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,103
And you didn't save shit.

50
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:18,762
Now wait,
you skipped the Sixth Key.

51
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:20,533
This makes no goddamn sense.

52
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:23,295
No, it's intentionally confusing.

53
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,732
<i>You see, Julia saved a bunch
of Fairies from slavery,</i>

54
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,468
<i>So the Fairy Queen was
like, I have the Sixth Key,</i>

55
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:32,109
<i>but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's...</i>

56
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,773
A creamy bitch is what she is.

57
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,760
<i>Meanwhile, Alice has
been acting real fishy.</i>

58
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,691
Quentin was all like...

59
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,723
Are you working for the Library?

60
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,145
- And she was all...
- Yes.

61
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:43,264
<i>And now,
if you would please refer</i>

62
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:45,001
<i>to the hookup/murder chart.</i>

63
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,562
Penny got with the other Alice.

64
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,140
- Interesting.
- Now that we know

65
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:54,815
who porked whom,
let's go over who murdered whom.

66
00:02:55,403 --> 00:02:56,984
Penny.

67
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,135
You're Kady.

68
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:10,758
- What's going on?
- I'm not your Penny.

69
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:26,019
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE MAGICIANS*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03  Episode 12</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Fillorian Candidate"</font>

70
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,362
Julia?

71
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,702
- Sorry, uh, what?
- What I'm saying is,

72
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,289
if there's a monster
behind the door,

73
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:36,368
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

74
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:37,867
But that's where magic is, like...

75
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:41,287
what, we can't exactly just stop.
Plus, this didn't come

76
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:43,506
- from the most reliable source.
- He was you.

77
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:46,578
- He was the Beast.
- Making decisions like this

78
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,386
without understanding the consequences

79
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,781
is exactly why magic is gone.

80
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,162
So we figure out if it's true.

81
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,072
We... we search the castle,
find out what's inside.

82
00:03:58,142 --> 00:03:59,909
We could ask the Library.

83
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,559
Yeah, you're right. You should ask them.

84
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:05,808
They say they want to help.

85
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,663
It'd be nice if they actually did.

86
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,236
I'll let you know what they say.

87
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:14,742
Q...

88
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:18,527
Do you have a better plan?

89
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,444
Yeah, maybe don't trust the Library?

90
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,766
They literally snort
the bones of Fairies.

91
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,095
We don't have to trust them.

92
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,915
The... Penny that
you brought with you,

93
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:27,018
- The...
- Penny 23.

94
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:30,041
Yeah, look.
Ask him to follow Alice

95
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,091
to the Library.
He can Astral Project,

96
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:33,766
they'll never even know he was there.

97
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,735
Catching up on the news?

98
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,035
My timeline was post apocalyptic,

99
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:46,176
and it wasn't this fucked up.

100
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,489
Alice is meeting with the Library.

101
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,877
We need you to follow
her on the Astral Plane.

102
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,248
Q thinks you're more
likely to say yes if I ask,

103
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,998
because you and the
other me shared a thing.

104
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,559
But we both know that
we're total strangers.

105
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:03,114
- So...
- Go on.

106
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:07,214
Well see, this is a
chance to un-fuck magic.

107
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,928
And as a new citizen of
Timeline 40,

108
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:12,831
that should be something
you would want to do.

109
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:15,000
Whoever asks.

110
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:18,385
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

111
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,348
It was built by the
gods, but its contents

112
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,130
are secret by design.
All we mortals know

113
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,843
is that we are not
meant to know.

114
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:27,776
Why wouldn't they want
you to know what's inside?

115
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,930
Perhaps it is indeed the
lair of a horrifying monster.

116
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:34,118
Or perhaps they simply
enjoy tormenting those of us

117
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:37,313
who dedicate our lives to
cataloguing information.

118
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,715
Well whatever their motive,

119
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:40,741
we'd be idiots to go in
totally blind.

120
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,626
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

121
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:44,845
A god. I believe your friends

122
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:49,312
have had encounters with them.
Now, there is another matter.

123
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,008
That's the Siphon?

124
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,044
We thought it'd be bigger.

125
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:07,227
It needs to be powered, and
it requires a lot of energy.

126
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,197
Our intended source has not fulfilled

127
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,170
their end of our bargain.

128
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,151
Well, how are we supposed to use it?

129
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,272
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

130
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,544
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

131
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,436
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

132
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:25,917
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

133
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,524
That could kill her.

134
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:34,736
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

135
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,650
We need the Siphon charged before...

136
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,481
I know.

137
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,045
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

138
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:54,431
- I'll be in touch.
- Remember.

139
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,754
Once magic is flowing again,

140
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,602
you have 30 seconds
to attach the Siphon.

141
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:04,278
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

142
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,554
<i>I come bearing gifts.</i>

143
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,300
This is like,
80% taco supplies.

144
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,226
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

145
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:28,537
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

146
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,152
No, no, if I have to
catch, pluck, or boil

147
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,428
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

148
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,235
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought it would be.

149
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:46,043
Listen, Fen.

150
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,994
Before you were born, you were promised

151
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:50,345
to a stranger. A king.

152
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,115
And... I'm not one
anymore.

153
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,174
You don't have to stay for my sake.

154
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:59,234
I'm guessing
you've never thought about

155
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,523
where I would be
if you never showed up.

156
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,317
I have.

157
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,677
Still in that same
village where I was born,

158
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,695
married to one of the three

159
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,674
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

160
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:14,346
Now those boys
want to drop you off a waterfall,

161
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:16,419
and that's them being polite.

162
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,195
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

163
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,170
That got less touching as you went.

164
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,834
I can't go back to my old life.

165
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,258
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

166
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,399
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

167
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,818
for the last Key,
but this is what we got back.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,407
- Eat my ass!
- We're not sure if...

169
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,506
Eat my ass!

170
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,368
- Eat. My. Ass!
- We're not sure if...

171
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,827
If this was
the Fairy Queen's response

172
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:46,171
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

173
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,778
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

174
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,906
<i>Eat. My. Ass.</i>

175
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:56,634
These are on the house.
For you saving my life.

176
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,136
We need to talk to your Queen.

177
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,072
You must know
how to get her to come.

178
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,974
- It's an emergency.
- No.

179
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,993
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

180
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,449
Glass half full... she didn't
actually go through with it.

181
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,375
But you must have
Fairy stepsisters

182
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:13,185
or someone you can talk to?

183
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,461
There were no Fairy
children in the realm.

184
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,867
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

185
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:20,478
Like me.

186
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,537
Being sent to you ruined everything.

187
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,119
I can't go back to the Fairy Realm.

188
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:27,132
I don't fit in with
humans. Why do you think

189
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,869
- I work at an animal bar?
- No, really,

190
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,578
really, I'm not judging you.

191
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,358
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

192
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,116
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

193
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:41,268
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked up childhood.

194
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,098
But what we want
to offer the Queen

195
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,784
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

196
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:50,715
Maybe the distance between
us can finally start to close.

197
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:54,315
And maybe then, you won't feel so alone.

198
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,991
That's kind.

199
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:59,098
But just so you know, I'm not alone.

200
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,140
No, really.

201
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,612
Bye, Margo.

202
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,399
Bye, Humbledrum.

203
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,306
I love that bear.

204
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,103
So do I.

205
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,107
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we were

206
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:18,507
- kind of having a moment.
- No, honey,

207
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,974
she <i>loves</i> him.

208
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:31,018
Uh, so not bear boss.
Bear boyfriend?

209
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:37,225
- Is that a thing in Fillory?
- Apparently, very taboo.

210
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:40,468
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

211
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,830
if I got my way,
I'd say go hog wild

212
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:44,559
or bear wild or bull wild.

213
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,854
He's very concerned about
getting your approval.

214
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:48,271
I don't think he quite gets

215
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,540
that you're not even Fray's real dad.

216
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,311
Well, then...

217
00:10:56,101 --> 00:11:00,260
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

218
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,700
I'm so happy you're dating a bear.

219
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,836
Thanks...

220
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,321
Dad.

221
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,535
<i>Thanks, Fray's dad.</i>

222
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,356
No problem.

223
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:19,986
<i>That's all the Librarian knows.</i>

224
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,389
We have to find somebody
who's been inside the Castle.

225
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:23,711
So...

226
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:26,390
A God. You say that like it's easy.

227
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,235
Our Lady Underground hasn't
answered me in months.

228
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,501
Yeah, the only way
to track Bacchus down

229
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,478
was his Instagram, and
it looks like it got deleted

230
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,581
for terms of service violations.

231
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,705
- Nipples, apparently.
- Well, that's bullshit.

232
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,881
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

233
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,649
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

234
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:50,947
She's lying.

235
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,164
Not about the God stuff,
that's true.

236
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:54,674
It's what she's leaving out.

237
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,104
They have some sort of metal thing

238
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,330
called a Siphon. She's
supposed to charge it up

239
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,841
by ripping out Julia's
power, which could kill her.

240
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,844
She didn't seem psyched
about the idea,

241
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,568
but she didn't say no.

242
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,881
So, now what?

243
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,934
What's that? Truth Key?

244
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,581
If it was,
I'd tell you to go away.

245
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,749
Unity.

246
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,021
The walkie-talkie key.

247
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,309
You're trying to talk
to the other Penny.

248
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:42,306
No offense...
you're the <i>other</i> Penny.

249
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,533
Look.

250
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:51,974
I don't blame you. You're
just trying to survive.

251
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:55,598
It's... it's everyone else.

252
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,284
Acting like finding you is enough.

253
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,114
When our Penny, the real Penny,

254
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:06,815
is out there. Down there.

255
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:10,184
And... maybe if...

256
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,109
we talk to him,
we could help him.

257
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,320
- Oh, what?
- Just...

258
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:23,174
all that shit that you
did for the other me.

259
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,699
The only person that
would have done that for me

260
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,839
on my timeline is
Julia.

261
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:32,986
Yeah, well...

262
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,671
our Julia is different.

263
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:40,533
She is not the person you loved.

264
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,569
You don't owe me anything.

265
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,419
But for what it's worth,

266
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:48,797
it'd be helpful if you explained it.

267
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,276
How she's different.

268
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,387
What about Reynard?

269
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:11,131
What happened to him
after O.L.U. took him away?

270
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,029
I don't know.

271
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:17,240
But it was his spark that
Our Lady gave to Julia.

272
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:19,772
And now it's not about me.

273
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,015
None of it ever really felt about me.

274
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:27,830
So I've, uh...

275
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:30,031
never really known how to deal

276
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,533
with how angry I am at all of it.

277
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:35,751
Wait, so he could be out there?

278
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:40,120
Still a god, but powerless?

279
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,028
I guess.

280
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,911
And only gods know
what's behind the door.

281
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,239
No.

282
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,269
We have to find Reynard.

283
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:07,317
Thank you for coming.
I actually have

284
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:08,777
nothing to say to you.

285
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:10,542
I know what you want.

286
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:14,364
- And I can't give it to you.
- We get it.

287
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:17,008
Humans will chop you up
and snort your innards.

288
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:19,316
But not all humans are
like that, you know that.

289
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,578
- We aren't.
- I told Julia about our Key

290
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:25,883
to give you all a chance
to give up on your quest.

291
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,928
We aren't questing,
we are surrendering.

292
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:29,158
We are giving you
what you want...

293
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,324
A nice, quiet,
moist as hell spot

294
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,303
on Fillory for you to settle.

295
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,410
And you give us the Key.

296
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,992
Or... I walk away.

297
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:40,618
And when the Lorians,
Floaters, and Western Hordes

298
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:44,021
are done with Fillory, I can take it.

299
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,555
All of it.

300
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:48,960
Our lifespans dwarf even the dwarves.

301
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:51,703
We can wait for what we want.

302
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:54,596
Oh, but you can't, can you?

303
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:58,379
You see, Fray,
well, she told us

304
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:00,889
that there are no Fairy
children in your realm.

305
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,362
So... that's a prob.

306
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,068
That's why you planted your eggs

307
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:07,634
in the Northern Orchard, isn't it?

308
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,755
You can't reproduce
in the Fairy Realm.

309
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,067
Without Fillory, you go extinct.

310
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,636
Fine, ignore the problem.

311
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:18,073
Your egg hole's only
getting dustier.

312
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,814
You no longer speak for
the people of Fillory.

313
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,451
Tick Pickwick does.

314
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,082
And he has no interest in a deal.

315
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,499
If you want my Key,
come back with a crown.

316
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:32,549
Or an army.

317
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,272
I pray to you,
Our Lady Underground.

318
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:44,753
Please don't be
withholding for once.

319
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:49,521
<i>- God damn it!</i>
- Hello?

320
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,600
Dean Fogg?

321
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,149
Were you talking in here?

322
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:03,050
No, I was not, why?

323
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:07,685
I, um, I woke up this morning

324
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:09,993
with this ringing in my ears.

325
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:11,654
You should get that checked.

326
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:15,419
By someone who isn't me.
But it's not just that.

327
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,336
I can feel what other
people are feeling.

328
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:24,103
You were given the power of a god.

329
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:28,528
Spiritual people might say
that you're hearing prayers.

330
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,121
I heard you.

331
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,608
I felt something coming from you.

332
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:38,071
What, exactly?

333
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,366
Desperation.

334
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:40,523
Oh.

335
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,572
Look, I think that I'm
supposed to help you...

336
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,622
No, I do not need your help.

337
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,454
Yes, you do.

338
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,799
- Your eyes...
- Were injured magically,

339
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:52,546
and fixing them with
magic risks changing

340
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:55,749
the very core of who I am.
Do you understand?

341
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,233
Yes.

342
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:01,397
If you did it, or another Magician.

343
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:04,090
But that's... not what I am, exactly.

344
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,771
If I'm hearing prayers, I'm supposed

345
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,931
to do something about them.
Why give me this otherwise?

346
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,133
You know, I put a little
leftover pigeon in my taco,

347
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,684
and it's really...

348
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,407
really bad.

349
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:06,648
We need the Key
to get back magic.

350
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,691
We need our thrones
to get the Key.

351
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,978
We need magic to get our thrones.

352
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,505
It is an ouroboros of ass.

353
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,485
Maybe King Idri
and the Stone Queen

354
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,126
will back our claims.
We defeat Tick's army,

355
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:20,536
- storm the castle...
- Yes, and,

356
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,215
what if we replace the part
where we kill everyone with...

357
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,641
Oh, off the top of my head...
democracy?

358
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:28,292
Like we were going to do
before magic got borked?

359
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,233
Tick's the only one who
can call for an election,

360
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,199
and he's got nothing to gain.

361
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:35,584
Oh, he'll call for it, all right.

362
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,348
Josh, I need you to go to Kinko's.

363
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,322
<i>Election? What is this?</i>

364
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:46,445
There are thousands of them.
They were falling from the sky.

365
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,972
Over villages, farms, a brothel...

366
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:53,685
I... happened to...
be walking by.

367
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:55,495
Collect them all and
burn them.

368
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:57,434
Of course,
your grumpiness.

369
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:01,812
But as Abigail wisely
reminded me,

370
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,441
the citizens now believe
they're getting elections.

371
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,029
You'd have to be the one
to announce they're not.

372
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,578
Given the
revolutionary mood

373
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,572
the people have been in
recently...

374
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:15,028
Your plan worked.

375
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,779
Tick already started putting
up his own campaign flyers.

376
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,630
Of course it worked.
Giving people shit is easy.

377
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,832
Taking it away is almost
impossible.

378
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,722
Like Obamacare.

379
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,591
Or herpes. Too true, Bambi.

380
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,796
Speaking of difficult conversations

381
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,908
with a former lover,
do you have a second?

382
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:36,556
Why the fuck shouldn't
my name be on that ballot?

383
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,388
Because we are running
for king.

384
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:40,565
We can call the job whatever
we want after we win it.

385
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,742
It has been a struggle
to bring this place

386
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,220
into the 20th century. - Yes, 20th,

387
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:47,304
because when we got here,
it was straight up Dark Ages,

388
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,638
and we have to start somewhere.

389
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,408
Yeah, we're really civilizing them.

390
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,681
What should we teach them
next? To outlaw abortion?

391
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,889
Women don't want to work?
Wage gaps? Thigh gaps?

392
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:57,575
Fillory is patriarchal.

393
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,253
And we've got to put
our best foot forward.

394
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,461
And I'm sorry,
but in this case,

395
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,543
our foot should have a dick.

396
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,081
What, Josh?

397
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:13,266
Do you have some patronizing
bullshit to tell me, too?

398
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:16,436
No, uh, could you drop me
off at the Earth portal tree?

399
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,360
- I have an idea, but I need...
- Me?

400
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,658
- How did you...
- Yeah, I have no idea.

401
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:27,210
Hi, Margo.
I felt you needed my help.

402
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,699
And now I'm here.
It's been a weird day.

403
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,655
Can't believe I did this.

404
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,940
This forest fed so many people.

405
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,476
Not for nothing,

406
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,582
but when I was at my lowest point,

407
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:43,798
that tiny spell you showed me,

408
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,127
it's what got me back in the fight.

409
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:50,670
Magic is the thing that makes
the children of Earth special.

410
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,179
All I'm asking is, try.

411
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:52,188
Vote Children of Earth.

412
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,956
Vote Children of Earth.

413
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,585
Vote the Children of Earth!

414
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,892
<i>Step right up, grab a poster.</i>

415
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:18,666
We need to talk.

416
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,741
- Look, Quentin...
- What is a Siphon?

417
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,983
And why do you need Julia to power it?

418
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,987
- You spied on me?
- What does it do?

419
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:31,060
It's a safeguard. That's all.

420
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,829
The Library wants to turn magic back on.

421
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,443
And once it's back on,
they want to make sure

422
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:36,954
it doesn't get used
for the wrong things

423
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:40,126
- by the wrong people.
- So, the Siphon diverts

424
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:44,559
magic to the Library so that
they can choose who can use it?

425
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,754
Look, you took a test
to get into Brakebills.

426
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,005
If you failed, you would
have gotten sent away,

427
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:54,316
with no memory of
magic. Happily ignorant.

428
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,652
But because a group of smart individuals

429
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:00,346
made a judgment call, they let you in.

430
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:03,587
Why should the Library get to choose?

431
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,381
They're corrupt, they're killers.

432
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,137
Yeah, so are we.

433
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,827
At least they have the information,

434
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:11,857
the perspective.

435
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:14,345
You love magic, and you're probably

436
00:24:14,426 --> 00:24:16,029
the best there is at it.

437
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,389
You're terrified of
what you'll do with it.

438
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,579
- I have reason to be.
- I don't know everything

439
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,719
that you did as a niffin, but
I know that people make mistakes

440
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:28,224
so that they can change
and do better.

441
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,465
But only if they're given the chance.

442
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:33,680
Taking away choice is not the answer.

443
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,204
There are seven Keys, and
we have eight questers.

444
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,485
We can do this without you, and we will.

445
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,641
Unless you give me the Siphon.

446
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,760
Just remember that when
magic was turned off,

447
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:05,852
your dad went into remission, Q.

448
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,932
And once you turn it back
on, his cancer comes back,

449
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,762
and he dies.

450
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:20,263
Straw polls are in, and
our ratings are way up.

451
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:23,580
I mean, off the charts.
Julia has done us

452
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,924
the solidest solid.
After the trees,

453
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:27,988
she grew food for the
starving peasants.

454
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,505
She fixed the dry wells.

455
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,896
She even helped this one guy's
bajanked case of head lice.

456
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:37,410
I mean, Children of
Earth are back on top!

457
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,567
Her Flealessness suggests
that your time as High King

458
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:46,515
has been so brief, the Fillorian people

459
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:48,542
don't yet know what you stand for.

460
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:52,695
I stand for them. I stand
for economic stability.

461
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:56,432
For a solid,
well-researched strategy.

462
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,569
That's it.

463
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:01,639
I'm going to tell them,
in detail, my plan.

464
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,057
Rafe, write this down.

465
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,556
My fellow Fillorians, I hereby set forth

466
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:12,629
my policy to restore
economic and societal growth

467
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:14,395
<i>to a reunified Fillory...</i>

468
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:19,167
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So uninspiring.

469
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:23,046
Does he really think he can
win by boring them to death?

470
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:24,849
Josh!

471
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:28,245
I hereby declare
all native Fillorians

472
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:30,887
shall receive ten free
sacks of grain every year.

473
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:32,523
And how exactly are
we supposed to

474
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:34,955
grow that much grain,
even with magic?

475
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,735
You're making a promise
you can't keep.

476
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,611
Bambi, first rule of
politics on Earth...

477
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:43,861
<i>All you have to do is say it.
It doesn't have to be true.</i>

478
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:48,412
I hereby declare,
under my administration,

479
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:51,234
<i>low-interest loans for
all new infrastructure.</i>

480
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:53,267
Easy. No-interest loans.

481
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,995
<i>And we're going to
build Fillory's first...</i>

482
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,216
Power... plants.

483
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:00,903
Like, Geraniums?

484
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:05,868
Will Tick's granular policies
keep you warm at night?

485
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,885
<i>No, you know what will?</i>

486
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,064
<i>Extending the Fillorian summer.</i>

487
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,301
My proposition for
growth in new sectors...

488
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,338
- Free healthcare for all!
- Based on rigorous

489
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,567
- rigorous survey research...
- Champagne fountains

490
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,645
- in every village.
- The abatement of dependency

491
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:20,691
- on the Golden Goose standard.
- Wealth!

492
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,432
<i>Regulation of
agricultural waste</i>

493
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,168
<i>to prevent
environmental runoff.</i>

494
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:26,057
- Feasts.
- Annual famine

495
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:28,544
- and rampant poverty.
- Boat parties!

496
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:30,505
Three cheers for Eliot!

497
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:33,073
- Hooray, hooray, hooray!
- Hooray, hooray, hooray!

498
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,830
- Eliot, I am so sorry.
- What is it?

499
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:40,024
Tick's campaign just leaked
the transcript from your trial.

500
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:41,871
You mean the one
where he called Fillory

501
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:43,622
a malodorous shithole?

502
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,007
<i>It's already hit the Posts.</i>

503
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,297
Son of a Pickwick.

504
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,310
Julia, what the fuck...

505
00:27:57,518 --> 00:28:00,148
There's a little boy in Syracuse.

506
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,565
I can feel his parents
praying.

507
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:09,285
I know if I just focus enough,
I can bring down his fever.

508
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:14,076
I feel bad interrupting this.

509
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,839
But we need your help
with something.

510
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:19,309
Finding Reynard.

511
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,423
I know.

512
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,949
But we need to talk to a god.

513
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:27,945
- I want to help you, but...
- Julia.

514
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:30,567
You have all the power now.

515
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:33,173
Yeah, but he's still a trickster.

516
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:35,549
We don't know what he's capable of.

517
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:40,815
Look, nobody hates that he's
still alive more than me.

518
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:43,215
But if we don't do it...

519
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:46,386
we're at a complete standstill.

520
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,541
All you'd have to do is locate him,

521
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:54,624
power up Penny's tattoos,
and we'll take it from there.

522
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,427
You can also say no.

523
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,206
I'm not going to send you there alone.

524
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:04,786
Great.

525
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:07,404
All right, I'll get the
stuff for the locater.

526
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,020
There's no need.

527
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:12,246
I can feel him with my mind.

528
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,472
- You guys ready?
- Wait, what are you...

529
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:26,118
This is the place.
He's nearby.

530
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:28,938
I have to say, this is
pretty disappointing.

531
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:30,670
Yeah.

532
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,133
We were all kind of
hoping to find Reynard

533
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:35,102
showering in a Russian prison.

534
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:49,674
Oh, shit.

535
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:58,820
Roxanne Gay,
Bell hooks, feminist lit?

536
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:02,860
What, are you saving these for
a rapist book burning party?

537
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,723
I've changed.

538
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,323
Living amongst the humans

539
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:09,019
has given me a whole new perspective.

540
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,524
You're still a liar and pathetic,

541
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,057
but I guess you always were.

542
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:17,951
Why are you here?

543
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:21,282
What could I have that
you could possibly want?

544
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:23,949
Let's talk about the Castle
at the End of the World.

545
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,173
What's inside?

546
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:28,022
How do you guys know about that place?

547
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:29,943
Answer her question.

548
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:31,828
You're not thinking of
going there, are you?

549
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,360
You know there's a reason
the gods had the Architect

550
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,559
- put it at the end of the world?
- The Architect?

551
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:40,223
It's not for you little guys
to know.

552
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:41,454
It's funny...

553
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:44,116
'cause from where I stand,
you're the little guy now.

554
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:50,199
You have all my power, and look at you.

555
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:53,306
Trying to handle something
you cannot handle.

556
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,784
You should have kept your mouth
shut and stayed in your place.

557
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,964
You've gotten yourself
into some real trouble now.

558
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,085
You think it's easy being a god?

559
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:06,233
You feel that?

560
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,664
Your... tiny... spark

561
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:15,648
has grown bigger in me than
it could have ever in you.

562
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:18,973
You want the truth about the Castle?

563
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,711
The Castle's where the gods put
the stuff they made before us.

564
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,517
The stuff that didn't
work out.

565
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:26,152
Mistakes that never
should have happened.

566
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,449
Kinda like you.
I hope you do go.

567
00:31:28,598 --> 00:31:30,818
Open that door,
see what happens!

568
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:35,452
No!

569
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:48,007
Recognize it?

570
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,985
Yeah.

571
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:56,878
I made it to kill him.
How did you get this?

572
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:59,104
Did Our Lady give it to you?

573
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:02,127
Of course not.

574
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,411
My mother left me here
\to rot.

575
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:06,861
My stepfather Hades was the
only one that took pity on me.

576
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:09,838
He slipped me that gun to shoot
myself in case of emergency.

577
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:11,358
I'm still a god.

578
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:13,841
Limp or not,
we're hard to kill.

579
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:21,392
What are you willing to
bet this god killing bullet

580
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,883
will work on the monster in the Castle?

581
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,507
The fate of the world?

582
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:30,216
That's good enough for me.

583
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:33,830
Whoa, that's it?

584
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:36,755
You're just going
to leave him there?

585
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:39,307
After what he did to the
both of you?

586
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,723
Shoot him.

587
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,836
Kady, you wanted this.

588
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:49,030
I wanted him to be
punished for what he did.

589
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:56,061
And he is. Leave him here.

590
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:10,521
I am here to deliver the
official election results.

591
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,834
Eliot has lost.

592
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,852
Shocker.

593
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:20,085
Uh, Tick has also lost.

594
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:21,486
Um, what?

595
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,590
Our new High King...

596
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:26,141
is Margo.

597
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:33,797
But I wa...
I wasn't even on the ballot.

598
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,469
- You won as a write in.
- Who wrote me in?

599
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:39,193
The talking animals.

600
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,308
It seems you were the only
human on the campaign trail

601
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:44,804
who stopped to listen
to their concerns.

602
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:47,178
You mean that drunk bear?

603
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:49,648
Humbledrum is a highly respected

604
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:53,590
member of the community.
You see, there are certain

605
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:57,110
taboo subjects
you broached with him.

606
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,214
Bestiality?

607
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,145
The talking animals believe

608
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:03,295
that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

609
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:06,298
then humans will finally
see them as equals.

610
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,622
None of us were brave
enough to speak out

611
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:12,270
in support of the cause,
until you.

612
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:17,475
You really love that sloth,
don't you?

613
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,138
So the human vote basically
means nothing in Fillory.

614
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:26,418
Considering there's
never been an election

615
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:28,348
or census before, we had no idea

616
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,035
there were only 50,000
humans in Fillory,

617
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:35,593
and upwards of a
million talking animals.

618
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,774
So... yes.

619
00:34:39,832 --> 00:34:42,936
On behalf of Abigail,
let me be the first

620
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:46,243
to swear loyalty to
the new administration.

621
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:50,435
El...

622
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,341
I'm so sorry.

623
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:07,168
And allow me to be the second.

624
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:12,213
High King Margo.
Long may you reign.

625
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:53,607
Hey, Tick.

626
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:57,365
I intend to choose Death
by a Thousand Pokes.

627
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:00,035
They say you only feel
the first hundred or so.

628
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:01,980
Tick, we're not going to
execute you.

629
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:04,269
If you proved anything
during your campaign,

630
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:07,853
it's that Fillory needs
a policy wonk like you.

631
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,379
You're still bitch listed, but...

632
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,425
King Margo
would like you in her cabinet.

633
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:17,324
With a full 24-hour security detail

634
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,095
watching everything you do.

635
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:22,361
We don't trust you,
but we need you.

636
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:32,010
Citizenship for every Fairy,
full protection of the law,

637
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,969
and a seat in the government.
But we need the Key.

638
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,685
And you shall have it.

639
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:39,818
Once the last Fairies have
been moved to our new home.

640
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:43,931
I always saw something in you.

641
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:47,525
Even when you didn't see it in yourself.

642
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:51,676
Now, perhaps you will.

643
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:03,491
You gave me...

644
00:37:04,498 --> 00:37:07,273
I can... I can see all sorts of things.

645
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:11,165
It's a Fairy eye.
A gift you will learn

646
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:13,183
to understand in time.

647
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,344
But one you must hide
in plain sight.

648
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:22,940
Could I maybe get some Fairy toes?

649
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:24,847
Hello?

650
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,500
<i>- It's cranky as shit.
- Just take a little</i>

651
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:45,878
<i>- off the top.
- I just collapsed</i>

652
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,148
<i>my entire rental.</i>

653
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,597
<i>- Last time, we were...
- Oh, my God...</i>

654
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:50,995
<i>Are we supposed to sing again?</i>

655
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:52,943
<i>- Holy shit, no.
- We've got news!</i>

656
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:54,776
- Penny, is that you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

657
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:56,480
<i>We just got the last
Key from the Fairies.</i>

658
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:59,516
Okay, everyone just shut up!
It's Penny.

659
00:37:59,662 --> 00:38:00,827
All right, look, listen.

660
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,642
I-I don't know how much time we have.

661
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:04,128
<i>- Kady.</i>
- But I'm going to get you out

662
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:06,722
of the Underworld, no matter
what it takes, I promise.

663
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:09,062
<i>- Kady.</i>
- I love you.

664
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,475
This is Penny 23.

665
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:16,448
The Key replaced my Penny with you.

666
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,685
Look, I'm really sorry.

667
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,044
This is it.

668
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:29,996
The end of the story.

669
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:33,102
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

670
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:36,663
Q? What's up,
what's wrong?

671
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,426
The quest is supposed to change us.

672
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,747
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

673
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:48,022
up to this point,
and I-I... I can't...

674
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:50,194
You thought that
when you got here,

675
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:54,641
you'd be... 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

676
00:38:55,174 --> 00:38:57,955
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

677
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,310
Because you're worried
about your dad.

678
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:03,874
Party trick.

679
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,083
I just feel things.

680
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:10,093
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

681
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:14,225
- Maybe...
- I could heal your dad?

682
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,161
Right now, he's perfectly healthy.

683
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,406
There's nothing to do.

684
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,480
If magic comes back,

685
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:27,881
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

686
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,973
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

687
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,714
It's the deal.

688
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,931
Sorry it's vague.

689
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:49,767
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

690
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:55,951
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

691
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:05,056
Then the quest fucked up when
it chose Quentin Coldwater.

692
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:07,883
Maybe.

693
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:15,654
It's all real.

694
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:20,923
The Chatwins and Fillory.

695
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:25,245
I've been there. I
s... I sat on a throne

696
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:28,025
in Whitespire, and I...

697
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,434
I explored the Flying Forest.

698
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:34,328
And I... met
Ember and Umber.

699
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,651
I remember reading you
those books.

700
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:42,453
Curly Q...

701
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:45,663
if all that's out there...

702
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:50,382
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on a quest.

703
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,069
In New Jersey?

704
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,771
I have a problem.

705
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,061
And I don't know what to do.

706
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:04,453
No matter what choice I
make, somebody gets hurt.

707
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,369
Magic's gone.

708
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,498
Isn't it?

709
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:13,320
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

710
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:15,957
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

711
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,373
And I knew it wasn't a
coincidence

712
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:21,336
when... I went into remission
a week later.

713
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:25,190
You're right. My friends
and I were trying to fix it.

714
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:29,184
- And how's that been going?
- We're getting really close.

715
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:37,457
So are you here to ask my permission?

716
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,347
To...

717
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:42,168
turn it back on?

718
00:41:46,189 --> 00:41:48,190
On this quest...

719
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:51,082
I've lived a whole life.

720
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:58,589
I grew old, and I got
married. And I had a son.

721
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:00,846
Who grew old.

722
00:42:02,371 --> 00:42:05,025
And what was all that
for if it's not for this?

723
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:12,647
No, I'm not here to
ask for your permission.

724
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:20,113
I wanted to look you in the eye

725
00:42:21,148 --> 00:42:23,458
and tell you that I'm sorry.

726
00:42:25,024 --> 00:42:27,279
I don't know what's going to happen.

727
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:31,522
But I'm going to do this.

728
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:39,623
What was his name?

729
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,466
Your son.

730
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,191
I named him after you.
