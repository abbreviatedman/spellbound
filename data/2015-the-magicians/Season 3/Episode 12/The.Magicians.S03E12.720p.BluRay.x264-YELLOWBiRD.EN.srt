1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,956
Previously on "Us"...

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,584
- What?
- Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:12,921
<i>A group of fine-looking grad students were
invited to a secret school for magic</i>

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,801
<i>where a bunch of stuff happened
that doesn't really matter,</i>

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,884
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,685
The answer to a riddle
they didn't even know to ask.

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,138
It's you.

8
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,689
Do you want this recap or not?

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,485
So, yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,937
<i>For a minute.
We became kings and queens.</i>

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,318
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,197
<i>Everyone hooked up.
I had a threesome with two harpies.</i>

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,574
Skip to the parts about me.

14
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,703
<i>You had a lot of drama
with your hands.</i>

15
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,831
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,207
<i>to help out Kady.</i>

17
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,913
Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,466
<i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,466
<i>Looks like she could crack
open your balls, because she can?</i>

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,515
<i>Well, it was a love
for the ages.</i>

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,559
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

22
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,645
<i>with some hedge witches.</i>

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,813
Especially her best bitch, Julia Wicker.
Their term, not mine.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,899
I would never.

25
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:11,319
Whatever went down
definitely made them ex-best...

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,738
Witches.

27
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,566
Truthfully, the only person
Kady can stand is you.

28
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,776
And that pretty much
cut both ways.

29
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,906
No, come on, Penny, don't...
Don't... Come on.

30
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,580
<i>And then you died. Kind of.</i>

31
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,159
Meanwhile, magic
got all jacked up.

32
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,503
You know what's weird,
that "jacked up" is bad,

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,547
but "jacked off" is great.

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,749
Focus, dude.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,628
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of fairy dicks

36
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,886
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,637
<i>so the people revolted.</i>

38
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,763
<i>Only ray of hope?</i>

39
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,015
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,142
Why? Question mark!

41
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,897
<i>We got sent on a dope quest to find
the Seven Keys that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,480
<i>But the fourth one got dragon-gobbled
and lost in the Underworld.</i>

43
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,113
The other Penny sent us the key,
but never came back.

44
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,910
Then came my grand adventure.

45
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,997
Hard pass.

46
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,915
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

47
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,789
- And snagged up key seven.
- Yeah, I was there for that.

48
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,120
You didn't save shit.

49
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,921
Now wait, you skipped
the Sixth Key.

50
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,670
This makes no goddamn sense.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,548
No, it's intentionally
confusing.

52
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,881
<i>You see, Julia saved a bunch
of fairies from slavery,</i>

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,717
<i>so the Fairy Queen was like,
"I have the Sixth Key,</i>"

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,473
<i>"but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's..."</i>

55
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,896
A creamy bitch is what she is.

56
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,565
<i>Meanwhile, Alice
has been acting real fishy.</i>

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,733
Quentin was all like...

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,880
Are you working for the Library?

59
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,395
- And she was all...
- Yes.

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,073
And now, if you would please refer to
the hookup/murder chart.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,993
Penny got with the other Alice.

62
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,115
Interesting.

63
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,413
Now that we know
who porked whom,

64
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,163
let's go over who murdered whom.

65
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,710
Penny?

66
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,673
You're Kady.

67
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,755
What's going on?

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,057
I'm not your Penny.

69
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,075
Julia?

70
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,663
Sorry, uh, what?

71
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,490
What I'm saying is, if there's a monster
behind the door,

72
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,583
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

73
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,162
But that's where magic is, like...
What, we can't exactly just stop.

74
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,373
Plus, this didn't come
from the most reliable source.

75
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,798
He was you.

76
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,045
He was The Beast.

77
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,254
Making decisions like this without
understanding the consequences

78
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,589
is exactly why magic is gone.

79
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,224
So we figure out if it's true.

80
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,894
We... We search the castle,
find out what's inside.

81
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,852
We could ask the Library.

82
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,360
Yeah, you're right.
You should ask them.

83
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,109
They say they want to help.

84
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,564
It'd be nice
if they actually did.

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,195
I'll let you know what they say.

86
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,578
Q...

87
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,784
Do you have a better plan?

88
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,665
Yeah, maybe
don't trust the Library?

89
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,042
They literally snort
the bones of fairies.

90
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,714
We don't have to trust them.

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,861
The Penny that you
brought with you,

92
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,171
- the...
- Penny 23.

93
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,261
Yeah, look.

94
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,962
Ask him to follow
Alice to the Library.

95
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,890
He can Astral Project, they'll
never even know he was there.

96
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,852
Catching up on the news?

97
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,187
My timeline was
post-apocalyptic,

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,065
and it wasn't this fucked up.

99
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,773
Alice is meeting
with the Library.

100
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,075
We need you to follow her
on the Astral Plane.

101
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,369
Q thinks you're more likely
to say yes if I ask,

102
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,244
because you and the other
me shared a thing.

103
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,826
But we both know
that we're total strangers.

104
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,456
- So...
- Go on.

105
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:01,591
Well... See, this is
a chance to unfuck magic.

106
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,089
And as a new citizen
of Timeline 40,

107
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,013
that should be something
you would want to do.

108
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,430
Whoever asks.

109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,677
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

110
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,014
It was built by the gods,
but its contents are secret by design.

111
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,066
All we mortals know is that
we are not meant to know.

112
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,020
Why wouldn't they want you
to know what's inside?

113
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,856
Perhaps it is indeed the lair
of a horrifying monster.

114
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,284
Or perhaps they simply enjoy
tormenting those of us

115
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,613
who dedicate our lives
to cataloging information.

116
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,826
Well, whatever their motive,

117
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,953
we'd be idiots
to go in totally blind.

118
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,784
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

119
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,878
A god.

120
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,580
I believe your friends
have had encounters with them.

121
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,212
Now, there is another matter.

122
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,097
That's the Siphon?

123
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,431
We thought it'd be bigger.

124
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,689
It needs to be powered,
and it requires a lot of energy.

125
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,067
Our intended source has not
fulfilled their end of our bargain.

126
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,449
Well, how am I
supposed to use it?

127
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,993
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

128
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,412
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

129
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,457
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

130
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,918
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

131
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,252
That could kill her.

132
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,716
We've all made sacrifices in pursuit
of our greater purpose.

133
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,808
We need the Siphon
charged before...

134
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,931
I know.

135
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,514
Hmm.

136
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,609
I just need some time
to figure out another way, or...

137
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,112
I'll be in touch.

138
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,860
Remember.

139
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,820
Once magic is flowing again, you have
30 seconds to attach the Siphon.

140
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,746
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

141
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,555
I come bearing gifts.

142
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,385
This is, like,
80% taco supplies.

143
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,266
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

144
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,769
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

145
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,225
No, no. If I have to catch,
pluck, or boil

146
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,437
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

147
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,245
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought I would be.

148
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,206
Listen, Fen.

149
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,035
Before you were born, you were
promised to a stranger.

150
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,164
A king.

151
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,501
And I'm not one anymore.

152
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,125
You don't have
to stay for my sake.

153
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,923
I'm guessing you've never thought about
where I would be if you never showed up.

154
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,177
I have.

155
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,894
Still in that same village
where I was born,

156
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,940
married to one of the three
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

157
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,268
Now those boys want to
drop you off a waterfall,

158
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,319
and that's them being polite.

159
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,282
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

160
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,278
That got less touching
as you went.

161
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,785
I can't go back to my old life.

162
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,789
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

163
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,792
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

164
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,124
for the last key, but this
is what we got back.

165
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,320
- Eat my ass!
- We're not sure if...

166
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,551
Eat my ass!

167
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,128
- We're not sure if...
- Eat. My. Ass!

168
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:39,305
If this was the Fairy Queen's response
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

169
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,057
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

170
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,638
Eat. My. Ass.

171
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,441
These are on the house.

172
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,860
For you saving my life.

173
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,232
We need to talk to your Queen.

174
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,109
You must know how
to get her to come.

175
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,031
- It's an emergency.
- No.

176
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:59,158
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

177
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,447
Glass half full. She didn't
actually go through with it.

178
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,335
But you must have fairy stepsisters
or someone you can talk to?

179
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,333
There were no fairy
children in the Realm.

180
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,962
Just humans they bargained away
from their real parents.

181
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,793
Like me.

182
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,721
Being sent to you
ruined everything.

183
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,217
I can't go back
to the Fairy Realm,

184
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,515
I don't fit in with humans.

185
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,684
Why do you think
I work at an animal bar?

186
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,434
No, really, really,
I'm not judging you.

187
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,389
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

188
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,103
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

189
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,363
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked-up childhood.

190
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,065
But what we want
to offer the Queen

191
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,903
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

192
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,455
Maybe the distance between us
can finally start to close.

193
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,243
And maybe then,
you won't feel so alone.

194
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,919
That's kind.

195
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,589
But just so you know,
I'm not alone.

196
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,671
No, really.

197
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,841
Bye, Margo.

198
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,388
Bye, Humbledrum.

199
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,514
I love that bear.

200
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,054
So do I.

201
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,936
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we
were kind of having a moment.

202
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,236
No, honey, she "loves" him.

203
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,868
Uh, so not bear boss.
Bear boyfriend?

204
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,916
Is that a thing in Fillory?

205
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,164
Apparently, very taboo.

206
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,464
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

207
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,419
if I got my way, I'd say go hog-wild
or bear-wild or bull-wild.

208
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,970
He's very concerned
about getting your approval.

209
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,549
I don't think he quite gets that
you're not even Fray's real dad.

210
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,853
Well, then...

211
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,893
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

212
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,613
I'm so happy
you're dating a bear.

213
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,906
Thanks...

214
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,238
Dad.

215
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,414
Thanks, Fray's dad.

216
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,414
No problem.

217
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,044
That's all the Librarian knows.

218
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,297
We have to find someone
who's been inside the castle.

219
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,840
So...

220
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,883
- A god.
- You say that like it's easy.

221
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,296
Our Lady Underground
hasn't answered me in months.

222
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,554
Yeah, the only way to track
Bacchus down was his Instagram

223
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,977
and it looks like it got deleted
for terms of service violations.

224
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,429
Nipples, apparently.

225
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,889
Well, that's bullshit.

226
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,645
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

227
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,107
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

228
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,776
She's lying.

229
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,199
Not about the god stuff,
that's true.

230
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,655
It's what she's leaving out.

231
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,618
They have some sort of
metal thing called a "Siphon."

232
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,170
She's supposed to charge it up
by ripping out Julia's power,

233
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,872
which could kill her.

234
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,551
She didn't seem psyched about
the idea, but she didn't say no.

235
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,755
So, now what?

236
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,562
What's that? Truth Key?

237
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,240
If it was, I'd tell you
to go away.

238
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,276
Unity.

239
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,362
The walkie-talkie key.

240
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,539
You're trying to talk
to the other Penny.

241
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:35,082
No offense...
You're the "other Penny".

242
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,835
Look.

243
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,587
I don't blame you.
You're just trying to survive.

244
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,675
It's... It's everyone else.

245
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,386
Acting like finding you
is enough,

246
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,726
when our Penny, the real Penny,
is out there.

247
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,110
Down there.

248
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,939
And maybe if...

249
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,034
If we talk to him,
we could help him.

250
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,243
What?

251
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,122
Just... All that shit that
you did for the other me.

252
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,691
The only person that
would have done that for me

253
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,628
on my timeline is Julia.

254
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,801
Yeah, well...

255
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,722
Our Julia is different.

256
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,644
She is not the person you loved.

257
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,513
You don't owe me anything.

258
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:42,194
But for what it's worth,
it'd be helpful if you explained it.

259
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,942
How she's different.

260
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,787
What about Reynard?

261
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,292
What happened to him
after OLU. Took him away?

262
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,796
I don't know.

263
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,343
But it was his spark
that Our Lady gave to Julia.

264
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,345
I know it's not about me.

265
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,936
None of it ever
really felt about me.

266
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,558
So I've, uh...

267
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,446
Never really known how to deal
with how angry I am at all of it.

268
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,073
Wait, so he could be out there?

269
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,325
Still a god, but powerless?

270
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,746
I guess.

271
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,835
And only gods know
what's behind the door.

272
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,462
No.

273
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,796
We have to find Reynard.

274
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,773
Thank you for coming.
I actually have nothing to say to you.

275
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,520
I know what you want.

276
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,227
And I can't give it to you.

277
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,402
We get it.

278
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,072
Humans will chop you up
and snort your innards.

279
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,366
But not all humans are like
that, you know that.

280
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,452
We aren't.

281
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,620
I told Julia about our key

282
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,869
to give you all a chance
to give up on your quest.

283
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,746
We aren't questing,
we are surrendering.

284
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,202
We are giving you what you want,

285
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,585
a nice, quiet, moist-as-hell spot
on Fillory for you to settle.

286
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,507
And you give us the key.

287
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,176
Or... I walk away.

288
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,596
And when the Lorians,
Floaters, and Western Hordes

289
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,141
are done with Fillory,
I can take it.

290
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,638
All of it.

291
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,766
Our lifespans dwarf
even the dwarves.

292
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,728
We can wait for what we want.

293
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,731
Oh, but you can't, can you?

294
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,364
You see, Fray, well, she told us

295
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,113
that there are no
fairy children in your realm.

296
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,411
So... That's a prob.

297
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,490
That's why you planted your eggs
in the Northern Orchard, isn't it?

298
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,576
You can't reproduce
in the Fairy Realm.

299
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,956
Without Fillory, you go extinct.

300
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,790
Fine, ignore the problem.

301
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,297
Your egg hole's
only getting dustier.

302
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,799
You no longer speak
for the people of Fillory.

303
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,757
Tick Pickwick does.

304
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,092
And he has no interest
in a deal.

305
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,146
If you want my key,
come back with a crown.

306
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,848
Or an army.

307
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,240
I pray to you,
Our Lady Underground.

308
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,781
Please don't be
withholding for once.

309
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,114
<i>God damn it!</i>

310
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,415
Hello?

311
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,210
Dean Fogg?

312
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,292
Were you talking in here?

313
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,878
No, I was not. Why?

314
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:01,853
I... I woke up this morning
with this ringing in my ears.

315
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,850
You should get that checked.

316
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,977
By someone who isn't me.

317
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,683
But it's not just that.

318
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,145
I can feel what
other people are feeling.

319
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,321
You were given
the power of a god.

320
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,700
Spiritual people might say
that you're hearing prayers.

321
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,707
I heard you.

322
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,536
I felt something
coming from you.

323
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,498
What, exactly?

324
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,672
Desperation.

325
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,655
Look, I think that I'm
supposed to help you...

326
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,592
No, I do not need your help.

327
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,389
Yes, you do.

328
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,268
Your eyes...

329
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,641
Were injured magically, and fixing them
with magic risks changing

330
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,471
the very core of who I am.

331
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,773
Do you understand?

332
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,065
Yes.

333
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,445
If you did it,
or another Magician.

334
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,365
But that's not
what I am, exactly.

335
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,160
If I'm hearing prayers, I'm supposed
to do something about them.

336
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,746
Why give me this otherwise?

337
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,334
You know, I put a little
leftover pigeon in my taco,

338
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,541
and it's really... Really bad.

339
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,753
We need the key
to get back magic.

340
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,712
We need our thrones
to get the key.

341
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,968
We need magic
to get our thrones.

342
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,642
It is an ouroboros of ass.

343
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,721
Maybe King Idri and the Stone
Queen will back our claims.

344
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,431
We defeat Tick's army,
storm the castle...

345
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,525
Yes, and,

346
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,102
what if we replace the part
where we kill everyone with...

347
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,654
Oh, off the top
of my head, democracy?

348
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,073
Like we were going to do
before magic got borked?

349
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,012
Tick's the only one who
can call for an election,

350
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,777
and he's got nothing to gain.

351
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,827
Oh, he'll call for it,
all right.

352
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,159
Josh, I need you
to go to Kinko's.

353
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,874
<i>Election? What is this?</i>

354
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,923
There are thousands of them.

355
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,420
They were falling from the sky.

356
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:42,095
Over villages,
farms, a brothel...

357
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,765
I... Happened to...
Be walking by.

358
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,558
Collect them all and burn them.

359
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,637
Of course, your grumpiness.

360
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,849
But as Abigail
wisely reminded me,

361
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,526
the citizens now believe
they're getting elections.

362
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,150
You'd have to be the one
to announce they're not.

363
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,951
Given the revolutionary mood
the people have been in recently...

364
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,990
Your plan worked.

365
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,744
Tick already started putting up
his own campaign flyers.

366
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,702
Of course it worked.
Giving people shit is easy.

367
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,832
Taking it away
is almost impossible.

368
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,505
Like Obamacare.

369
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,798
Or herpes.

370
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,876
Too true, Bambi.

371
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,011
Speaking of difficult conversations
with a former lover, do you have a second?

372
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,057
Why the fuck shouldn't
my name be on that ballot?

373
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,181
Because we are running for king.

374
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,729
We can call the job whatever
we want after we win it.

375
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,058
It has been a struggle to bring
this place into the 20th century.

376
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,152
Yes, 20th,

377
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,444
because when we got here,
it was straight-up Dark Ages,

378
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,770
and we have to start somewhere.

379
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,530
Yeah, we're really
civilizing them.

380
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,616
What should we teach them next,
to outlaw abortion?

381
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,993
Women don't want to work?
Wage gaps? Thigh gaps?

382
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,662
Fillory is patriarchal.

383
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,162
And we've got to put
our best foot forward.

384
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,913
And I'm sorry, but in this case,

385
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,336
our foot should have a dick.

386
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,590
What, Josh?

387
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,462
Do you have some patronizing
bullshit to tell me, too?

388
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,469
No. Could you drop me off
at the Earth portal tree?

389
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,516
I have an idea, but I need...

390
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,139
Me?

391
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,515
How did you...

392
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,064
Yeah, I have no idea.

393
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,150
Hi, Margo.

394
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,191
I felt you needed my help.

395
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,773
And now I'm here.
It's been a weird day.

396
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,609
Can't believe I did this.

397
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,949
This forest fed so many people.

398
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,783
Not for nothing, but when I was
at my lowest point,

399
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,538
that tiny spell you showed me,

400
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,961
it's what got me back
in the fight.

401
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,633
Magic is the thing that makes
the Children of Earth special.

402
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,301
All I'm asking is, try.

403
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,148
Vote Children of Earth.

404
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,615
Vote Children of Earth.

405
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,703
Vote the Children of Earth!

406
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,991
Step right up, grab a poster.

407
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,636
We need to talk.

408
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,963
Look, Quentin...

409
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,763
What is a Siphon?

410
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,058
And why do you need
Julia to power it?

411
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,351
You spied on me?

412
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,803
What does it do?

413
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,265
It's a safeguard. That's all.

414
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,851
The Library wants
to turn magic back on.

415
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,298
And once it's back on,
they want to make sure

416
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,360
it doesn't get used for the
wrong things by the wrong people.

417
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,362
So, the Siphon diverts

418
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,492
magic to the Library so that
they can choose who can use it?

419
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,908
Look, you took a test
to get into Brakebills.

420
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,994
If you failed, you would
have gotten sent away,

421
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,623
with no memory of magic.

422
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,296
Happily ignorant.

423
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:51,132
But because a group of smart individuals
made a judgment call, they let you in.

424
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,673
Why should the Library
get to choose?

425
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,258
They're corrupt,
they're killers.

426
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,809
Yeah, so are we.

427
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,556
At least they have the information,
the perspective.

428
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,023
You love magic, and you're
probably the best there is at it.

429
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,113
You're terrified of what
you'll do with it.

430
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,240
I have reason to be.

431
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,864
I don't know everything
that you did as a Niffin,

432
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:19,289
but I know that people make mistakes
so that they can change and do better.

433
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,662
But only if they're
given the chance.

434
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,870
Taking away choice
is not the answer.

435
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,132
There are seven keys,
and we have eight questers.

436
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,632
We can do this
without you, and we will.

437
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,758
Unless you give me the Siphon.

438
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,820
Just remember that
when magic was turned off,

439
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,993
your dad went into remission, Q.

440
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,411
And once you turn it back on,

441
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,205
his cancer comes back,
and he dies.

442
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,132
Straw polls are in,
and our ratings are way up.

443
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,834
I mean, off the charts.

444
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,671
Julia has done us
the solidest solid.

445
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,178
After the trees, she grew food
for the starving peasants.

446
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,600
She fixed the dry wells.

447
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,978
She even helped this one guy's
bajanked case of head lice.

448
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,399
I mean, Children of Earth
are back on top!

449
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,987
Her Flealessness suggests that your
time as high king has been so brief,

450
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,490
the Fillorian people don't yet know
what you stand for.

451
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,287
I stand for them.

452
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,786
I stand for economic stability.

453
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,119
For a solid,
well-researched strategy.

454
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,496
That's it.

455
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,708
I'm going to tell them,
in detail, my plan.

456
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,418
Rafe, write this down.

457
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:01,592
My fellow Fillorians, I hereby
set forth my policy to restore

458
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,474
economic and societal growth
to a reunified Fillory...

459
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,400
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
So uninspiring.

460
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,355
Does he really think he can
win by boring them to death?

461
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,529
Josh!

462
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,325
I hereby declare
all native Fillorians

463
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,028
shall receive ten free
sacks of grain every year.

464
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,535
And how exactly are we
supposed to grow that much grain,

465
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,241
even with magic?

466
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,952
You're making a promise
you can't keep.

467
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,789
Bambi, first rule
of politics on Earth.

468
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,248
<i>All you have to do is say it.</i>

469
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,755
<i>It doesn't have to be true.</i>

470
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,387
I hereby declare,
under my administration,

471
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,261
<i>low-interest loans
for all new infrastructure.</i>

472
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,183
Easy. No-interest loans.

473
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,949
<i>And we're going to
build Fillory's first...</i>

474
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,971
"Power... Plants."

475
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,812
Like, geraniums?

476
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:57,026
Will Tick's granular policies
keep you warm at night?

477
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,823
<i>No. You know what will?</i>

478
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,196
<i>Extending the Fillorian summer.</i>

479
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,243
My proposition for growth
in new sectors...

480
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,287
- Free healthcare for all!
- Based on rigorous

481
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,366
- survey research...
- Champagne fountains

482
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,496
<i>- in every village.
- The abatement of dependency</i>

483
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,872
on the Golden Goose standard.

484
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:11,963
Wealth!

485
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,165
<i>Regulation of agricultural
waste to prevent environmental runoff.</i>

486
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,423
- Feasts.
- Annual famine and rampant poverty.

487
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,593
Boat parties!

488
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,967
Three cheers for Eliot!

489
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,140
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

490
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,890
- Eliot, I am so sorry.
- What is it?

491
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,346
Tick's campaign just leaked

492
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,271
the transcript from your trial.

493
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,647
You mean the one where he called Fillory
"a malodorous shithole"?

494
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,062
<i>It's already hit the posts.</i>

495
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,192
Son of a Pickwick.

496
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,448
Julia, what the fuck...

497
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,955
There's
a little boy in Syracuse.

498
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,496
I can feel his parents praying.

499
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,923
I know if I just focus enough,
I can bring down his fever.

500
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,599
I feel bad interrupting this.

501
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,926
But we need your help
with something.

502
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,178
Finding Reynard.

503
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,143
I know.

504
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,309
But we need to talk to a god.

505
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,894
I want to help you, but...

506
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,104
Julia.

507
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,611
You have all the power now.

508
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,401
Yeah, but he's
still a trickster.

509
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,451
We don't know
what he's capable of.

510
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,791
Look, nobody hates that he's
still alive more than me.

511
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:37,005
But if we don't do it,
we're at a complete standstill.

512
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,589
All you'd have to do
is locate him,

513
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,592
power up Penny's tattoos,
and we'll take it from there.

514
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,548
You can also say no.

515
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,226
I'm not going to
send you there alone.

516
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,316
Great.

517
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,463
All right, I'll get the stuff
for the locator.

518
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,728
There's no need.

519
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,239
I can feel him with my mind.

520
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,067
You guys ready?

521
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,402
Wait, what are you...

522
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,701
This is the place.

523
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,961
He's nearby.

524
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,165
I have to say,
this is pretty disappointing.

525
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,466
Yeah.

526
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:26,092
We were all kind of hoping to find
Reynard showering in a Russian prison.

527
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,359
Oh, shit.

528
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,909
Roxane Gay,
bell hooks, feminist lit?

529
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,078
What, are you saving these

530
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,030
for a rapist book-burning party?

531
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,744
I've changed.

532
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,543
Living amongst
the humans has given me

533
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,291
a whole new perspective.

534
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:04,046
You're still a liar and pathetic,
but I guess you always were.

535
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,837
Why are you here?

536
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,265
What could I have
that you could possibly want?

537
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,344
Let's talk about the Castle
at the End of the World.

538
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,679
What's inside?

539
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,851
How do you guys know
about that place?

540
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,603
Answer her question.

541
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,192
You're not thinking
of going there, are you?

542
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,299
You know there's a reason
the gods had the Architect

543
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,985
put it at the end of the world?

544
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,155
"The Architect"?

545
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,808
It's not for you
little guys to know.

546
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,202
It's funny...

547
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,197
'Cause from where I stand,
you're the little guy now.

548
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,458
You have all my power,
and look at you.

549
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,506
Trying to handle
something you cannot handle.

550
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,676
You should have kept your mouth shut
and stayed in your place.

551
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,095
You've gotten yourself
into some real trouble now.

552
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,717
You think it's easy being a god?

553
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,764
You feel that?

554
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,014
Your tiny spark

555
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,362
has grown bigger in me than
it could have ever in you.

556
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,781
You want the truth
about the Castle?

557
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,610
The Castle's where the gods
put the stuff they made before us.

558
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,444
The stuff that didn't work out.

559
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,201
Mistakes that never
should have happened.

560
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,374
Kinda like you.
I hope you do go.

561
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,077
Open that door,
see what happens!

562
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,543
No!

563
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,764
Recognize it?

564
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,607
Yeah.

565
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,399
I made it to kill him.

566
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,728
How did you get this?

567
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,530
Did Our Lady give it to you?

568
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,275
Of course not.

569
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,486
My mother left me here to rot.

570
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,808
My stepfather Hades was
the only one that took pity on me.

571
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,666
He slipped me that gun to shoot
myself in case of emergency.

572
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,413
I'm still a god.

573
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,745
Limp or not, we're hard to kill.

574
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,503
What are you willing to bet
this god-killing bullet

575
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,553
will work on the monster
in the Castle?

576
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,346
The fate of the world?

577
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,102
That's good enough for me.

578
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,598
Whoa, that's it?

579
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,396
You're just going
to leave him there?

580
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,229
After what he did
to the both of you?

581
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,401
Shoot him.

582
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,868
Kady, you wanted this.

583
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,243
I wanted him to be
punished for what he did.

584
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,535
And he is.

585
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,874
Leave him here.

586
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,306
I am here to deliver
the official election results.

587
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,558
Eliot has lost.

588
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,606
Shocker.

589
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,358
Uh...

590
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,936
Tick has also lost.

591
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,525
Um, what?

592
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,527
Our new High King...

593
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,783
Is Margo.

594
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,866
But I... I wasn't
even on the ballot.

595
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,872
You won as a write-in.

596
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,498
Who wrote me in?

597
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,421
The talking animals.

598
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,216
It seems you were the only
human on the campaign trail

599
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,919
who stopped to listen
to their concerns.

600
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,221
You mean that drunk bear?

601
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:41,051
Humbledrum is a highly respected
member of the community.

602
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:47,266
You see, there are certain taboo
subjects you broached with him.

603
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,271
Bestiality?

604
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,318
The talking animals believe

605
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,382
that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

606
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,240
then humans will finally
see them as equals.

607
00:33:56,326 --> 00:34:02,288
None of us were brave enough to speak
out in support of the cause, until you.

608
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,581
You really love that sloth,
don't you?

609
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:14,342
So the human vote basically
means nothing in Fillory.

610
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,465
Considering there's never been
an election or census before,

611
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,890
we had no idea there were only
50,000 humans in Fillory,

612
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,596
and upwards of a million
talking animals.

613
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,681
So... Yes.

614
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,735
On behalf of Abigail,
let me be the first

615
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:36,360
to swear loyalty
to the new administration.

616
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:39,952
El...

617
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,789
I'm so sorry.

618
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,339
And allow me to be the second.

619
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:02,010
High King Margo.
Long may you reign.

620
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,760
Hey, Tick.

621
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,639
I intend to choose
Death by a Thousand Pokes.

622
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,392
They say you only feel
the first hundred or so.

623
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,973
Tick, we're not going
to execute you.

624
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,059
If you proved anything
during your campaign,

625
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,896
it's that Fillory needs
a policy wonk like you.

626
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,982
You're still
bitch-listed, but...

627
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,193
King Margo would like you
in her cabinet.

628
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:09,624
With a full 24-hour security detail
watching everything you do.

629
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,873
We don't trust you,
but we need you.

630
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,965
Citizenship for every fairy,
full protection of the law,

631
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,637
and a seat in the government.

632
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,930
But we need the key.

633
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,757
And you shall have it.

634
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,810
Once the last fairies have
been moved to our new home.

635
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,848
I always saw something in you.

636
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,522
Even when you didn't
see it in yourself.

637
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,693
Now, perhaps you will.

638
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,783
You gave me...

639
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,630
I can... I can see
all sorts of things.

640
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,832
It's a fairy eye.

641
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:03,135
A gift you will learn
to understand in time.

642
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,513
But one you must hide
in plain sight.

643
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,103
Could I maybe
get some fairy toes?

644
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,646
Hello?

645
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,453
<i>Cranky as shit.</i>

646
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,909
<i>Just take a little off the top.</i>

647
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,710
<i>I just
collapsed my entire rental.</i>

648
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,913
<i>- Last time, we were...</i>
- Oh, my God...

649
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,498
<i>Are we supposed to sing again?</i>

650
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,424
<i>- Holy shit, no.
- We've got news!</i>

651
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,046
- Penny, is that you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

652
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,924
<i>We just got
the last key from the fairies.</i>

653
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,927
Okay, everyone
just shut up! It's Penny.

654
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,474
All right, look, listen.

655
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,912
I don't know how
much time we have.

656
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,598
<i>- Kady.</i>
- But I'm going to get you out

657
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,101
of the Underworld, no matter
what it takes, I promise.

658
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,604
<i>- Kady.</i>
- I love you.

659
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,605
This is Penny 23.

660
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,948
The key replaced
my Penny with you.

661
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,868
Look, I'm really sorry.

662
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,829
This is it.

663
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,036
The end of the story.

664
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,131
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

665
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,797
Q? What's up, what's wrong?

666
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,842
The quest is supposed
to change us.

667
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,144
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

668
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,813
up to this point,
and I... I can't...

669
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,640
You thought that
when you got here,

670
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,853
you'd be 150% sure
you were doing the right thing.

671
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,773
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

672
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,574
Because you're worried
about your dad.

673
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,036
Party trick.

674
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,491
I just feel things.

675
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,794
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

676
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,415
Maybe...

677
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,748
I could heal your dad?

678
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,585
Right now,
he's perfectly healthy.

679
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,341
There's nothing to do.

680
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,132
If magic comes back,

681
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:17,687
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

682
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,355
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

683
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,895
It's the deal.

684
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,024
Sorry it's vague.

685
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,246
What if the thing that the quest
wants me to be is cold?

686
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,548
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

687
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,551
Then the quest fucked up
when it chose Quentin Coldwater.

688
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,727
Maybe.

689
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,608
It's all real.

690
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,605
The Chatwins and Fillory.

691
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,407
I've been there.

692
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:17,204
I... I sat on a throne
in Whitespire, and I...

693
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,786
I explored the Flying Forest.

694
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,665
And I... Met Ember and Umber.

695
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,583
I remember reading you
those books.

696
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,468
Curly Q...

697
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,763
If all that's out there...

698
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,391
What are you doing here?

699
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,434
I'm on a quest.

700
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,645
In New Jersey?

701
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,646
I have a problem.

702
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,191
And I don't know what to do.

703
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,361
No matter what choice I make,
somebody gets hurt.

704
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,069
Magic's gone.

705
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,453
Isn't it?

706
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,450
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

707
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,036
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

708
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,830
And I knew
it wasn't a coincidence

709
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,883
when I went into
remission a week later.

710
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,005
You're right.

711
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,337
My friends and I
were trying to fix it.

712
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,217
And how's that been going?

713
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,469
We're getting really close.

714
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,023
So are you here
to ask my permission?

715
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,226
To...

716
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,395
Turn it back on?

717
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,984
On this quest...

718
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,405
I've lived a whole life.

719
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,165
I grew old, and I got married.
And I had a son.

720
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,789
Who grew old.

721
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,798
And what was all that for
if it's not for this?

722
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,055
No, I'm not here
to ask for your permission.

723
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,309
I wanted to look you in the eye

724
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,269
and tell you that I'm sorry.

725
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,277
I don't know
what's going to happen.

726
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,786
But I'm going to do this.

727
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,497
What was his name?

728
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,247
Your son.

729
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,757
I named him after you.
