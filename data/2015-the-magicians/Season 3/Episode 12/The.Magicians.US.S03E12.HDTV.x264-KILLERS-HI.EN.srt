you'd be 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

725
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,626
Because you're worried about your dad.

- Maybe...
- I could heal your dad?

730

Right now, he's perfectly healthy.

There's nothing to do.

If magic comes back,

733
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:10,588
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

734

be able to help or not.
