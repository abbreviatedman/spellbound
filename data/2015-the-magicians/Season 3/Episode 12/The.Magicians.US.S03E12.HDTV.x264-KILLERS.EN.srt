1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,747
Previously on "Us"...

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,778
- What?
- Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:09,113
A group of fine looking grad students

4
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:11,916
were invited to a secret school for magic

5
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:13,348
where a bunch of stuff happened

6
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,692
that doesn't really matter,

7
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,889
until they ran into a mysterious figure.

8
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,684
The answer to a riddle they
didn't even know to ask.

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,926
It's you.

10
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,461
Do you want this recap or not?

11
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:27,265
So yeah, it was me. Things were awesome.

12
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,934
For a minute. We became kings and queens.

13
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:32,103
Well, everybody but you.

14
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:35,890
Everyone hooked up, I had a
threesome with two harpies.

15
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:38,408
Just get to the parts about me.

16
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:41,546
You had a lot of drama with your hands.

17
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,682
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

18
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:47,952
- to help out Kady.
- Wait, who's that?

19
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:51,046
Kady Orloff-Diaz? Love of your life?

20
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,731
Looks like she could
crack open your balls,

21
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,225
because she can?

22
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:57,085
Well, it was a love for the ages.

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,231
Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head

24
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,367
with some hedge witches.
Especially her best bitch,

25
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,469
Julia Wicker. Their term, not mine.

26
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,405
I would never. Whatever went down

27
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:10,408
definitely made them ex-best...

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,276
Witches. Truthfully,

29
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,245
the only person Kady can stand is you.

30
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,481
And that pretty much cut both ways.

31
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:18,616
No, come on, Penny,
don't... don't... Come on.

32
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:21,285
And then you died. Kind of.

33
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:25,656
Meanwhile, magic got all jacked up.

34
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:28,226
You know what's weird,
that jacked up is bad,

35
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,363
- but jacked off is great.
- Focus, dude.

36
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:35,333
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of Fairy dicks

37
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,636
invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,

38
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:41,506
so the people revolted. Only ray of hope?

39
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:43,965
Julia mysteriously still has magic.

40
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:46,077
Why? Question mark!

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,828
We got sent on a dope quest

42
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,647
to find the Seven Keys that unlock magic.

43
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,517
But the fourth one got dragon gobbled

44
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,218
and lost in the Underworld.

45
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,053
The other Penny sent us the key,

46
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:58,089
but never came back.

47
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,858
- Then came my grand adventure.
- Hard pass.

48
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,762
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

49
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07,498
- And snagged up Key seven.
- Yeah, I was there for that.

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,906
And you didn't save shit.

51
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,636
Now wait, you skipped the Sixth Key.

52
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:13,371
This makes no goddamn sense.

53
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,274
No, it's intentionally confusing.

54
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:19,644
You see, Julia saved a bunch
of Fairies from slavery,

55
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:22,447
So the Fairy Queen was
like, I have the Sixth Key,

56
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,216
but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's...

57
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:27,618
A creamy bitch is what she is.

58
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,632
Meanwhile, Alice has
been acting real fishy.

59
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:31,663
Quentin was all like...

60
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,557
Are you working for the Library?

61
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,057
- And she was all...
- Yes.

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,127
And now, if you would please refer

63
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,913
to the hookup/murder chart.

64
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,765
Penny got with the other Alice.

65
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,893
- Interesting.
- Now that we know

66
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:48,138
who porked whom, let's
go over who murdered whom.

67
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,830
Penny.

68
00:02:56,683 --> 00:03:00,084
You're Kady.

69
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:03,788
- What's going on?
- I'm not your Penny.

70
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:18,235
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

71
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,341
Julia?

72
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:25,510
- Sorry, uh, what?
- What I'm saying is,

73
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:27,278
if there's a monster behind the door,

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,347
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

75
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,882
But that's where magic is, like...

76
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:34,185
what, we can't exactly just
stop. Plus, this didn't come

77
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:36,554
- from the most reliable source.
- He was you.

78
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:39,490
- He was the Beast.
- Making decisions like this

79
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:41,225
without understanding the consequences

80
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,213
is exactly why magic is gone.

81
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:46,082
So we figure out if it's true.

82
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:50,654
We... we search the castle,
find out what's inside.

83
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:52,424
We could ask the Library.

84
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:57,304
Yeah, you're right. You should ask them.

85
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,562
They say they want to help.

86
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:00,878
It'd be nice if they actually did.

87
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,893
I'll let you know what they say.

88
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,635
Q...

89
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:11,428
Do you have a better plan?

90
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,356
Yeah, maybe don't trust the Library?

91
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,793
They literally snort
the bones of Fairies.

92
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:17,007
We don't have to trust them.

93
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,529
The Penny that you brought with you,

94
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,897
- The...
- Penny 23.

95
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,900
Yeah, look. Ask him to follow Alice

96
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:24,902
to the Library. He can Astral Project,

97
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,916
they'll never even know he was there.

98
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,346
Catching up on the news?

99
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,014
My timeline was post apocalyptic,

100
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:40,284
and it wasn't this fucked up.

101
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,553
Alice is meeting with the Library.

102
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,789
We need you to follow
her on the Astral Plane.

103
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,127
Q thinks you're more
likely to say yes if I ask,

104
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,885
because you and the
other me shared a thing.

105
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:53,409
But we both know that
we're total strangers.

106
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:56,164
- So...
- Go on.

107
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:00,393
Well see, this is a
chance to un-fuck magic.

108
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:02,840
And as a new citizen of Timeline 40,

109
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:05,743
that should be something
you would want to do.

110
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,830
Whoever asks.

111
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,327
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

112
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,260
It was built by the
gods, but its contents

113
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,893
are secret by design.
All we mortals know

114
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:17,821
is that we are not meant to know.

115
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:20,758
Why wouldn't they want
you to know what's inside?

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,628
Perhaps it is indeed the
lair of a horrifying monster.

117
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,854
Or perhaps they simply
enjoy tormenting those of us

118
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:30,225
who dedicate our lives to
cataloguing information.

119
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,627
Well whatever their motive,

120
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,564
we'd be idiots to go in totally blind.

121
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,606
Then ask someone who's been inside.

122
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,486
A god. I believe your friends

123
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:42,165
have had encounters with them.
Now, there is another matter.

124
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,659
That's the Siphon?

125
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,135
We thought it'd be bigger.

126
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:00,139
It needs to be powered, and
it requires a lot of energy.

127
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,932
Our intended source has not fulfilled

128
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,702
their end of our bargain.

129
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:07,305
Well, how are we supposed to use it?

130
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,999
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

131
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,276
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

132
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,813
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

133
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:20,585
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

134
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:24,021
That could kill her.

135
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:27,487
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

136
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:33,562
We need the Siphon charged before...

137
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,499
I know.

138
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:43,737
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

139
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,409
- I'll be in touch.
- Remember.

140
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:49,604
Once magic is flowing again,

141
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:53,151
you have 30 seconds
to attach the Siphon.

142
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:57,256
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

143
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:11,153
I come bearing gifts.

144
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:13,757
This is like, 80% taco supplies.

145
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,661
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

146
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:19,163
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

147
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,632
No, no, if I have to
catch, pluck, or boil

148
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,879
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

149
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,644
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought it would be.

150
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:36,581
Listen, Fen.

151
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,382
Before you were born, you were promised

152
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,185
to a stranger. A king.

153
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:44,188
And I'm not one anymore.

154
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,391
You don't have to stay for my sake.

155
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,660
I'm guessing you've never thought about

156
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:52,363
where I would be if you never showed up.

157
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,265
I have.

158
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,301
Still in that same
village where I was born,

159
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,161
married to one of the three

160
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,272
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

161
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:04,675
Now those boys want to
drop you off a waterfall,

162
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:07,445
and that's them being polite.

163
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:10,581
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

164
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,619
That got less touching as you went.

165
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:18,089
I can't go back to my old life.

166
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:22,622
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

167
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,879
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

168
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,298
for the last Key, but
this is what we got back.

169
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,728
- Eat my ass!
- We're not sure if...

170
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:29,926
Eat my ass!

171
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,601
Eat. My. Ass!

172
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,505
If this was the Fairy Queen's response

173
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,707
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

174
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,477
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

175
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,379
Eat. My. Ass.

176
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:47,294
These are on the house.
For you saving my life.

177
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,819
We need to talk to your Queen.

178
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,688
You must know how to get her to come.

179
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,623
- It's an emergency.
- No.

180
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,497
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

181
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,996
Glass half full... she didn't
actually go through with it.

182
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:01,699
But you must have Fairy stepsisters

183
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,868
or someone you can talk to?

184
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,870
There were no Fairy
children in the realm.

185
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:09,403
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

186
00:09:09,406 --> 00:09:11,090
Like me.

187
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,027
Being sent to you ruined everything.

188
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,780
I can't go back to the Fairy Realm.

189
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,648
I don't fit in with
humans. Why do you think

190
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,318
- I work at an animal bar?
- No, really,

191
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,987
really, I'm not judging you.

192
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,989
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

193
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,693
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

194
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,778
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked up childhood.

195
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,481
But what we want to offer the Queen

196
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:37,352
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

197
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:41,591
Maybe the distance between
us can finally start to close.

198
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,841
And maybe then, you won't feel so alone.

199
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,544
That's kind.

200
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:49,419
But just so you know, I'm not alone.

201
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,902
No, really.

202
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:55,161
Bye, Margo.

203
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,630
Bye, Humbledrum.

204
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:01,754
I love that bear.

205
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,490
So do I.

206
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:05,593
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we were

207
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:09,270
- kind of having a moment.
- No, honey,

208
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:11,406
she loves him.

209
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:21,420
Uh, so not bear boss. Bear boyfriend?

210
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,852
- Is that a thing in Fillory?
- Apparently, very taboo.

211
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,958
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

212
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,223
if I got my way, I'd say go hog wild

213
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:35,051
or bear wild or bull wild.

214
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,434
He's very concerned about
getting your approval.

215
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,736
I don't think he quite gets

216
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,939
that you're not even Fray's real dad.

217
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,419
Well, then...

218
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:51,826
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

219
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:55,192
I'm so happy you're dating a bear.

220
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,552
Thanks...

221
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:02,887
Dad.

222
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:05,556
Thanks, Fray's dad.

223
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:07,762
No problem.

224
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,606
That's all the Librarian knows.

225
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:12,775
We have to find somebody
who's been inside the Castle.

226
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,278
So...

227
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,282
A god. You say that like it's easy.

228
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,718
Our Lady Underground hasn't
answered me in months.

229
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,888
Yeah, the only way to track Bacchus down

230
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,972
was his Instagram, and it
looks like it got deleted

231
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,387
for terms of service violations.

232
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,324
Nipples, apparently.
Well, that's bullshit.

233
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,428
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

234
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:35,122
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

235
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,735
She's lying.

236
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,604
Not about the god stuff, that's true.

237
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,274
It's what she's leaving out.

238
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,744
They have some sort of metal thing

239
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,781
called a Siphon. She's
supposed to charge it up

240
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:54,403
by ripping out Julia's
power, which could kill her.

241
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,231
She didn't seem psyched about the idea,

242
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,151
but she didn't say no.

243
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:01,522
So, now what?

244
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:18,009
What's that? Truth Key?

245
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:21,079
If it was, I'd tell you to go away.

246
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:23,550
Unity.

247
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:25,486
The walkie-talkie key.

248
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,989
You're trying to talk
to the other Penny.

249
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:32,361
No offense... you're the other Penny.

250
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:38,629
Look.

251
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,966
I don't blame you. You're
just trying to survive.

252
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:46,454
It's... it's everyone else.

253
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:49,791
Acting like finding you is enough.

254
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:53,796
When our Penny, the real Penny,

255
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,534
is out there. Down there.

256
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:01,372
And maybe if...

257
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,677
we talk to him, we could help him.

258
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,890
- Oh, what?
- Just...

259
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:14,208
all that shit that you
did for the other me.

260
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,163
The only person that
would have done that for me

261
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:20,372
on my timeline is Julia.

262
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,776
Yeah, well...

263
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,280
our Julia is different.

264
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:30,985
She is not the person you loved.

265
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:34,490
You don't owe me anything.

266
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,826
But for what it's worth,

267
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,597
it'd be helpful if you explained it.

268
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,633
How she's different.

269
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,782
What about Reynard?

270
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,718
What happened to him
after O.L.U. took him away?

271
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,887
I don't know.

272
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,791
But it was his spark that
Our Lady gave to Julia.

273
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,694
And now it's not about me.

274
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:13,340
None of it ever really felt about me.

275
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,817
So I've, uh...

276
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,484
never really known how to deal

277
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:23,722
with how angry I am at all of it.

278
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:26,993
Wait, so he could be out there?

279
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:30,631
Still a god, but powerless?

280
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:32,333
I guess.

281
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:37,487
And only gods know
what's behind the door.

282
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:45,729
No.

283
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,590
We have to find Reynard.

284
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:55,734
Thank you for coming. I actually have

285
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:57,158
nothing to say to you.

286
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,594
I know what you want.

287
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:02,697
- And I can't give it to you.
- We get it.

288
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,523
Humans will chop you up
and snort your innards.

289
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,765
But not all humans are
like that, you know that.

290
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:11,070
- We aren't.
- I told Julia about our Key

291
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:14,409
to give you all a chance
to give up on your quest.

292
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,077
We aren't questing, we are surrendering.

293
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,546
We are giving you what you want...

294
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,713
A nice, quiet, moist as hell spot

295
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,950
on Fillory for you to settle.

296
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,852
And you give us the Key.

297
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:26,555
Or... I walk away.

298
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:28,957
And when the Lorians,
Floaters, and Western Hordes

299
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,494
are done with Fillory, I can take it.

300
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,029
All of it.

301
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:37,165
Our lifespans dwarf even the dwarves.

302
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,101
We can wait for what we want.

303
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:43,805
Oh, but you can't, can you?

304
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,775
You see, Fray, well, she told us

305
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:49,544
that there are no Fairy
children in your realm.

306
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:52,814
So... that's a prob.

307
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,516
That's why you planted your eggs

308
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,015
in the Northern Orchard, isn't it?

309
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:58,070
You can't reproduce in the Fairy Realm.

310
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:01,690
Without Fillory, you go extinct.

311
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:04,159
Fine, ignore the problem.

312
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,661
Your egg hole's only getting dustier.

313
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:09,164
You no longer speak for
the people of Fillory.

314
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,133
Tick Pickwick does.

315
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:15,103
And he has no interest in a deal.

316
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:19,507
If you want my Key,
come back with a crown.

317
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,242
Or an army.

318
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:30,085
I pray to you, Our Lady Underground.

319
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:33,188
Please don't be withholding for once.

320
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:37,726
- God damn it!
- Hello?

321
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,001
Dean Fogg?

322
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,635
Were you talking in here?

323
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:52,674
No, I was not, why?

324
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,956
I, um, I woke up this morning

325
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,278
with this ringing in my ears.

326
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,215
You should get that checked.

327
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:04,085
By someone who isn't me.
But it's not just that.

328
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:08,590
I can feel what other
people are feeling.

329
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:12,694
You were given the power of a god.

330
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:17,033
Spiritual people might say
that you're hearing prayers.

331
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,236
I heard you.

332
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:24,706
I felt something coming from you.

333
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,651
What, exactly?

334
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,908
Desperation.

335
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,190
Oh.

336
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:31,132
Look, I think that I'm
supposed to help you...

337
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,049
No, I do not need your help.

338
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,918
Yes, you do.

339
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,187
- Your eyes...
- Were injured magically,

340
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,089
and fixing them with
magic risks changing

341
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:44,225
the very core of who I
am. Do you understand?

342
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,094
Yes.

343
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:49,729
If you did it, or another Magician.

344
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:52,633
But that's not what I am, exactly.

345
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:54,976
If I'm hearing prayers, I'm supposed

346
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:59,531
to do something about them.
Why give me this otherwise?

347
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:48,573
You know, I put a little
leftover pigeon in my taco,

348
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,424
and it's really...

349
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:52,026
really bad.

350
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,230
We need the Key to get back magic.

351
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,198
We need our thrones to get the Key.

352
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
We need magic to get our thrones.

353
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:02,070
It is an ouroboros of ass.

354
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,905
Maybe King Idri and the Stone Queen

355
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,479
will back our claims.
We defeat Tick's army,

356
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,976
- storm the castle...
- Yes, and,

357
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:11,589
what if we replace the part
where we kill everyone with...

358
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:13,926
Oh, off the top of my head... democracy?

359
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,563
Like we were going to do
before magic got borked?

360
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,386
Tick's the only one who
can call for an election,

361
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:21,756
and he's got nothing to gain.

362
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:24,292
Oh, he'll call for it, all right.

363
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,561
Josh, I need you to go to Kinko's.

364
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,398
Election? What is this?

365
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:34,903
There are thousands of them.
They were falling from the sky.

366
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:38,773
Over villages, farms, a brothel...

367
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:42,081
I... happened to... be walking by.

368
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,883
Collect them all and burn them.

369
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,953
Of course, your grumpiness.

370
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:50,192
But as Abigail wisely reminded me,

371
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:52,924
the citizens now believe
they're getting elections.

372
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:55,690
You'd have to be the one
to announce they're not.

373
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,926
Given the revolutionary mood

374
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,854
the people have been in recently...

375
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,432
Your plan worked.

376
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,202
Tick already started putting
up his own campaign flyers.

377
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,987
Of course it worked.
Giving people shit is easy.

378
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,123
Taking it away is almost impossible.

379
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,794
Like Obamacare.

380
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,165
Or herpes. Too true, Bambi.

381
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:19,001
Speaking of difficult conversations

382
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:22,305
with a former lover,
do you have a second?

383
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,651
Why the fuck shouldn't
my name be on that ballot?

384
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:26,784
Because we are running for king.

385
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:29,106
We can call the job whatever
we want after we win it.

386
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:31,076
It has been a struggle
to bring this place

387
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,651
into the 20th century. Yes, 20th,

388
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:35,755
because when we got here,
it was straight up Dark Ages,

389
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:37,023
and we have to start somewhere.

390
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:38,826
Yeah, we're really civilizing them.

391
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,134
What should we teach them
next? To outlaw abortion?

392
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:43,401
Women don't want to work?
Wage gaps? Thigh gaps?

393
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:46,105
Fillory is patriarchal.

394
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,682
And we've got to put
our best foot forward.

395
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:51,152
And I'm sorry, but in this case,

396
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:52,987
our foot should have a dick.

397
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:58,599
What, Josh?

398
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,869
Do you have some patronizing
bullshit to tell me, too?

399
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,872
No, uh, could you drop me
off at the Earth portal tree?

400
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:08,576
- I have an idea, but I need...
- Me?

401
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:12,480
- How did you...
- Yeah, I have no idea.

402
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:15,816
Hi, Margo. I felt you needed my help.

403
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:20,187
And now I'm here. It's been a weird day.

404
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:24,151
Can't believe I did this.

405
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:26,360
This forest fed so many people.

406
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:28,062
Not for nothing,

407
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,231
but when I was at my lowest point,

408
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,500
that tiny spell you showed me,

409
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:34,435
it's what got me back in the fight.

410
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:39,073
Magic is the thing that makes
the children of Earth special.

411
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,464
All I'm asking is, try.

412
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:40,568
Vote Children of Earth.

413
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,503
Vote Children of Earth.

414
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,986
Vote the Children of Earth!

415
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:53,042
Step right up, grab a poster.

416
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:05,037
We need to talk.

417
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,040
- Look, Quentin...
- What is a Siphon?

418
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,309
And why do you need Julia to power it?

419
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:12,945
- You spied on me?
- What does it do?

420
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,394
It's a safeguard. That's all.

421
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,964
The Library wants to turn magic back on.

422
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,512
And once it's back on,
they want to make sure

423
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:23,155
it doesn't get used for the wrong things

424
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:26,858
- by the wrong people.
- So, the Siphon diverts

425
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,479
magic to the Library so that
they can choose who can use it?

426
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,037
Look, you took a test
to get into Brakebills.

427
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,206
If you failed, you would
have gotten sent away,

428
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:40,944
with no memory of
magic. Happily ignorant.

429
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:43,008
But because a group of smart individuals

430
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,839
made a judgment call, they let you in.

431
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:49,909
Why should the Library get to choose?

432
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,582
They're corrupt, they're killers.

433
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:53,919
Yeah, so are we.

434
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:56,121
At least they have the information,

435
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:58,957
the perspective.

436
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,559
You love magic, and you're probably

437
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,128
the best there is at it.

438
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,042
You're terrified of
what you'll do with it.

439
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,780
- I have reason to be.
- I don't know everything

440
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:11,854
that you did as a niffin, but
I know that people make mistakes

441
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:14,291
so that they can change and do better.

442
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:16,694
But only if they're given the chance.

443
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:19,815
Taking away choice is not the answer.

444
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:25,406
There are seven Keys, and
we have eight questers.

445
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,740
We can do this without you, and we will.

446
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,776
Unless you give me the Siphon.

447
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:49,962
Just remember that when
magic was turned off,

448
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:52,098
your dad went into remission, Q.

449
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,067
And once you turn it back
on, his cancer comes back,

450
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,703
and he dies.

451
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:06,398
Straw polls are in, and
our ratings are way up.

452
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:09,715
I mean, off the charts.
Julia has done us

453
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,118
the solidest solid. After the trees,

454
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,253
she grew food for the starving peasants.

455
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:15,760
She fixed the dry wells.

456
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:19,140
She even helped this one guy's
bajanked case of head lice.

457
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:23,404
I mean, Children of
Earth are back on top!

458
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:29,769
Her Flealessness suggests
that your time as High King

459
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:32,726
has been so brief, the Fillorian people

460
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:34,807
don't yet know what you stand for.

461
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,911
I stand for them. I stand
for economic stability.

462
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:42,148
For a solid, well-researched strategy.

463
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:44,851
That's it.

464
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:47,854
I'm going to tell them,
in detail, my plan.

465
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:51,057
Rafe, write this down.

466
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,757
My fellow Fillorians, I hereby set forth

467
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,865
my policy to restore
economic and societal growth

468
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,596
to a reunified Fillory...

469
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,504
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So uninspiring.

470
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:09,475
Does he really think he can
win by boring them to death?

471
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:11,911
Josh!

472
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:14,447
I hereby declare all native Fillorians

473
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,149
shall receive ten free
sacks of grain every year.

474
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,818
And how exactly are we supposed to

475
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,354
grow that much grain, even with magic?

476
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:24,123
You're making a promise you can't keep.

477
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,959
Bambi, first rule of
politics on Earth...

478
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,996
All you have to do is say it.
It doesn't have to be true.

479
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,656
I hereby declare,
under my administration,

480
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,436
low-interest loans for
all new infrastructure.

481
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:39,492
Easy. No-interest loans.

482
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:41,195
And we're going to
build Fillory's first...

483
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:44,343
Power... plants.

484
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:48,080
Like, geraniums?

485
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:52,218
Will Tick's granular policies
keep you warm at night?

486
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,020
No, you know what will?

487
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,389
Extending the Fillorian summer.

488
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:58,542
My proposition for
growth in new sectors...

489
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:00,745
- Free healthcare for all!
- Based on rigorous

490
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,848
- rigorous survey research...
- Champagne fountains

491
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,984
- in every village.
- The abatement of dependency

492
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:06,964
- on the Golden Goose standard.
- Wealth!

493
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,633
Regulation of agricultural waste

494
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:10,303
to prevent environmental runoff.

495
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:12,338
- Feasts.
- Annual famine

496
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,941
- and rampant poverty.
- Boat parties!

497
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:16,846
Three cheers for Eliot!

498
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:19,311
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

499
00:27:19,314 --> 00:27:23,049
- Eliot, I am so sorry.
- What is it?

500
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:26,128
Tick's campaign just leaked
the transcript from your trial.

501
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:27,986
You mean the one where he called Fillory

502
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,889
a malodorous shithole?

503
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:31,825
It's already hit the Posts.

504
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:37,534
Son of a Pickwick.

505
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,636
Julia, what the fuck...

506
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:47,340
There's a little boy in Syracuse.

507
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:50,643
I can feel his parents praying.

508
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:56,115
I know if I just focus enough,
I can bring down his fever.

509
00:27:56,117 --> 00:28:00,953
I feel bad interrupting this.

510
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:04,023
But we need your help with something.

511
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,559
Finding Reynard.

512
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:09,028
I know.

513
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,497
But we need to talk to a god.

514
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:14,300
- I want to help you, but...
- Julia.

515
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,403
You have all the power now.

516
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,605
Yeah, but he's still a trickster.

517
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:22,174
We don't know what he's capable of.

518
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:27,380
Look, nobody hates that he's
still alive more than me.

519
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:30,349
But if we don't do it...

520
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:33,419
we're at a complete standstill.

521
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,822
All you'd have to do is locate him,

522
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:40,826
power up Penny's tattoos,
and we'll take it from there.

523
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:42,795
You can also say no.

524
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,468
I'm not going to send you there alone.

525
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,760
Great.

526
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,672
All right, I'll get the
stuff for the locater.

527
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,308
There's no need.

528
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,812
I can feel him with my mind.

529
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:02,482
- You guys ready?
- Wait, what are you...

530
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:12,390
This is the place. He's nearby.

531
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:15,394
I have to say, this is
pretty disappointing.

532
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:17,196
Yeah.

533
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:19,231
We were all kind of
hoping to find Reynard

534
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:21,237
showering in a Russian prison.

535
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:35,692
Oh, shit.

536
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:43,185
Roxanne Gay, Bell hooks, feminist lit?

537
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:46,897
What, are you saving these for
a rapist book burning party?

538
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,904
I've changed.

539
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:50,205
Living amongst the humans

540
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,275
has given me a whole new perspective.

541
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:55,477
You're still a liar and pathetic,

542
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,946
but I guess you always were.

543
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:02,302
Why are you here?

544
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:05,253
What could I have that
you could possibly want?

545
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:08,356
Let's talk about the Castle
at the End of the World.

546
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,225
What's inside?

547
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:11,993
How do you guys know about that place?

548
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:13,914
Answer her question.

549
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,984
You're not thinking of
going there, are you?

550
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:18,265
You know there's a reason
the gods had the Architect

551
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:22,504
- put it at the end of the world?
- The Architect?

552
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:24,005
It's not for you little guys to know.

553
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:25,640
It's funny...

554
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:28,243
'cause from where I stand,
you're the little guy now.

555
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:34,482
You have all my power, and look at you.

556
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:37,519
Trying to handle something
you cannot handle.

557
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:40,755
You should have kept your mouth
shut and stayed in your place.

558
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,890
You've gotten yourself
into some real trouble now.

559
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,759
You think it's easy being a god?

560
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:50,498
You feel that?

561
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,635
Your... tiny... spark

562
00:30:53,637 --> 00:31:00,508
has grown bigger in me than
it could have ever in you.

563
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,011
You want the truth about the Castle?

564
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,647
The Castle's where the gods put
the stuff they made before us.

565
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,390
The stuff that didn't work out.

566
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:09,953
Mistakes that never
should have happened.

567
00:31:09,956 --> 00:31:12,420
Kinda like you. I hope you do go.

568
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:14,789
Open that door, see what happens!

569
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:19,262
No!

570
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,836
Recognize it?

571
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:36,544
Yeah.

572
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:40,782
I made it to kill him.
How did you get this?

573
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:43,618
Did Our Lady give it to you?

574
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,179
Of course not.

575
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:48,382
My mother left me here to rot.

576
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,792
My stepfather Hades was the
only one that took pity on me.

577
00:31:50,794 --> 00:31:53,762
He slipped me that gun to shoot
myself in case of emergency.

578
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:55,226
I'm still a god.

579
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:57,448
Limp or not, we're hard to kill.

580
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,429
What are you willing to
bet this god killing bullet

581
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:07,399
will work on the monster in the Castle?

582
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,117
The fate of the world?

583
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,187
That's good enough for me.

584
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:18,253
Whoa, that's it?

585
00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:20,455
You're just going to leave him there?

586
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:23,892
After what he did to the both of you?

587
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:25,694
Shoot him.

588
00:32:28,088 --> 00:32:30,022
Kady, you wanted this.

589
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:33,192
I wanted him to be
punished for what he did.

590
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:40,032
And he is. Leave him here.

591
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,279
I am here to deliver the
official election results.

592
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:58,217
Eliot has lost.

593
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,185
Shocker.

594
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:04,056
Uh, Tick has also lost.

595
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:05,457
Um, what?

596
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:08,427
Our new High King...

597
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:09,914
is Margo.

598
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:17,768
But I wa... I wasn't even on the ballot.

599
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:21,440
- You won as a write in.
- Who wrote me in?

600
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:23,342
The talking animals.

601
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:26,144
It seems you were the only
human on the campaign trail

602
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:29,114
who stopped to listen to their concerns.

603
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:31,216
You mean that drunk bear?

604
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,619
Humbledrum is a highly respected

605
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:37,689
member of the community.
You see, there are certain

606
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:41,260
taboo subjects you broached with him.

607
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:43,262
Bestiality?

608
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:44,937
The talking animals believe

609
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,265
that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

610
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:50,269
then humans will finally
see them as equals.

611
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:52,471
None of us were brave
enough to speak out

612
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:56,241
in support of the cause, until you.

613
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,446
You really love that sloth, don't you?

614
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:08,287
So the human vote basically
means nothing in Fillory.

615
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:10,389
Considering there's
never been an election

616
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:12,156
or census before, we had no idea

617
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,859
there were only 50,000
humans in Fillory,

618
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:19,564
and upwards of a
million talking animals.

619
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,600
So... yes.

620
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:26,737
On behalf of Abigail,
let me be the first

621
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,342
to swear loyalty to
the new administration.

622
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,406
El...

623
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:39,273
I'm so sorry.

624
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:52,296
And allow me to be the second.

625
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,934
High King Margo. Long may you reign.

626
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:37,809
Hey, Tick.

627
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:41,646
I intend to choose Death
by a Thousand Pokes.

628
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:44,258
They say you only feel
the first hundred or so.

629
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:46,018
Tick, we're not going to execute you.

630
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,320
If you proved anything
during your campaign,

631
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:51,957
it's that Fillory needs
a policy wonk like you.

632
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,860
You're still bitch listed, but...

633
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,396
King Margo would like
you in her cabinet.

634
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:01,195
With a full 24-hour security detail

635
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:03,286
watching everything you do.

636
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:06,557
We don't trust you, but we need you.

637
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,981
Citizenship for every Fairy,
full protection of the law,

638
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:18,950
and a seat in the government.
But we need the Key.

639
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,819
And you shall have it.

640
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:23,789
Once the last Fairies have
been moved to our new home.

641
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:28,693
I always saw something in you.

642
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:31,496
Even when you didn't see it in yourself.

643
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,734
Now, perhaps you will.

644
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:48,466
You gave me...

645
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:51,369
I can... I can see all sorts of things.

646
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:54,974
It's a Fairy eye. A gift you will learn

647
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:57,711
to understand in time.

648
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,381
But one you must hide in plain sight.

649
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,023
Could I maybe get some Fairy toes?

650
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,593
Hello?

651
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,816
- It's cranky as shit.
- Just take a little

652
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,194
- off the top.
- I just collapsed

653
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:29,587
my entire rental.

654
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,755
- Last time, we were...
- Oh, my God...

655
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:33,390
Are we supposed to sing again?

656
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:35,326
- Holy shit, no.
- We've got news!

657
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:36,927
- Penny, is that you?
- Yeah.

658
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,796
We just got the last
Key from the Fairies.

659
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,832
Okay, everyone just shut up! It's Penny.

660
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,143
All right, look, listen.

661
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:44,768
I-I don't know how much time we have.

662
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,537
- Kady.
- But I'm going to get you out

663
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:49,132
of the Underworld, no matter
what it takes, I promise.

664
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:51,509
- Kady.
- I love you.

665
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,878
This is Penny 23.

666
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:58,816
The Key replaced my Penny with you.

667
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:02,001
Look, I'm really sorry.

668
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,360
This is it.

669
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:12,863
The end of the story.

670
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:15,900
Floodgates of magic, ready to be opened.

671
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:18,602
Q? What's up, what's wrong?

672
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:25,742
The quest is supposed to change us.

673
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:28,045
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

674
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:30,713
up to this point, and I-I... I can't...

675
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:32,550
You thought that when you got here,

676
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:37,488
you'd be 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

677
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,690
Now, you're only somewhere around 70%.

678
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,626
Because you're worried about your dad.

679
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,962
Party trick.

680
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:49,466
I just feel things.

681
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:52,736
I heard you healed Dean Fogg's eyes.

682
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,541
- Maybe...
- I could heal your dad?

683
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:00,477
Right now, he's perfectly healthy.

684
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:03,814
There's nothing to do.

685
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:06,016
If magic comes back,

686
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:10,588
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

687
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:14,458
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

688
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,794
It's the deal.

689
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:19,797
Sorry it's vague.

690
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:32,083
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

691
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:38,515
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

692
00:39:43,522 --> 00:39:48,158
Then the quest fucked up when
it chose Quentin Coldwater.

693
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:49,861
Maybe.

694
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:58,268
It's all real.

695
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:04,107
The Chatwins and Fillory.

696
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,645
I've been there. I
s... I sat on a throne

697
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:10,881
in Whitespire, and I...

698
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:12,816
I explored the Flying Forest.

699
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:16,621
And I... met Ember and Umber.

700
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,860
I remember reading you those books.

701
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:25,229
Curly Q...

702
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:28,866
if all that's out there...

703
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:33,137
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on a quest.

704
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,307
In New Jersey?

705
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,711
I have a problem.

706
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:43,781
And I don't know what to do.

707
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:47,918
No matter what choice I
make, somebody gets hurt.

708
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,287
Magic's gone.

709
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:52,923
Isn't it?

710
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:55,926
I'm not like you. I'm not a Magician.

711
00:40:55,928 --> 00:40:58,896
But I could feel it when it was gone.

712
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:00,631
And I knew it wasn't a coincidence

713
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:03,901
when I went into remission a week later.

714
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:07,506
You're right. My friends
and I were trying to fix it.

715
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,642
- And how's that been going?
- We're getting really close.

716
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:20,083
So are you here to ask my permission?

717
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,548
To...

718
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,484
turn it back on?

719
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,395
On this quest...

720
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:33,398
I've lived a whole life.

721
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:41,404
I grew old, and I got
married. And I had a son.

722
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:44,708
Who grew old.

723
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,696
And what was all that
for if it's not for this?

724
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:54,972
No, I'm not here to
ask for your permission.

725
00:41:59,714 --> 00:42:03,215
I wanted to look you in the eye

726
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:07,020
and tell you that I'm sorry.

727
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,595
I don't know what's going to happen.

728
00:42:11,736 --> 00:42:14,737
But I'm going to do this.

729
00:42:20,045 --> 00:42:23,046
What was his name?

730
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,449
Your son.

731
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:28,218
I named him after you.

732
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:44,562
