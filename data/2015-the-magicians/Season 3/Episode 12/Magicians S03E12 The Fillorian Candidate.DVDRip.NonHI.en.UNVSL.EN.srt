1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,967
Previously on "Us"...

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,563
What? Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,937
<i>A group of fine-looking grad students
were invited to a secret school for magic</i>

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,812
<i>where a bunch of stuff happened
that doesn't really matter,</i>

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,910
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,717
The answer to a riddle
they didn't even know to ask.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,154
It's you.

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,714
Do you want this recap or not?

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,489
So, yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,963
<i>For a minute. We
became kings and queens.</i>

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,330
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,201
<i>Everyone hooked up. I had
a threesome with two harpies.</i>

13
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,604
Skip to the parts about me.

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,734
<i>You had a lot of
drama with your hands.</i>

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,836
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

16
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,211
<i>to help out Kady.</i>

17
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,909
Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,483
<i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,489
<i>Looks like she could crack
open your balls, because she can?</i>

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,526
<i>Well, it was a
love for the ages.</i>

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,562
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,652
<i>with some hedge witches.</i>

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,824
Especially her best bitch, Julia
Wicker. Their term, not mine.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,923
I would never.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,301
Whatever went down
definitely made them ex-best...

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,762
Witches.

27
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,570
Truthfully, the only person
Kady can stand is you.

28
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,804
And that pretty
much cut both ways.

29
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,938
No, come on, Penny,
don't... Don't... Come on.

30
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,573
<i>And then you died. Kind of.</i>

31
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,177
Meanwhile, magic
got all jacked up.

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,523
You know what's weird,
that "jacked up" is bad,

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,559
but "jacked off" is great.

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,752
Focus, dude.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,662
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of fairy dicks

36
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,894
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,663
<i>so the people revolted.</i>

38
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,794
<i>Only ray of hope?</i>

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,031
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,165
Why? Question mark!

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,905
<i>We got sent on a dope quest to
find the Seven Keys that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,507
<i>But the fourth one got dragon-gobbled
and lost in the Underworld.</i>

43
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,144
The other Penny sent us
the key, but never came back.

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,916
Then came my grand adventure.

45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,013
Hard pass.

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,924
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

47
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,827
And snagged up key seven.
Yeah, I was there for that.

48
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,158
You didn't save shit.

49
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,927
Now wait, you
skipped the Sixth Key.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,696
This makes no goddamn sense.

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,567
No, it's intentionally
confusing.

52
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,904
<i>You see, Julia saved a
bunch of fairies from slavery,</i>

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,739
<i>so the Fairy Queen was
like, "I have the Sixth Key,</i>

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,473
<i>"but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's..."</i>

55
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,913
A creamy bitch is what she is.

56
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,577
<i>Meanwhile, Alice has
been acting real fishy.</i>

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,745
Quentin was all like...

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,896
Are you working for the Library?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,411
And she was all... Yes.

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,085
And now, if you would please
refer to the hookup/murder chart.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,027
Penny got with the other Alice.

62
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,119
Interesting.

63
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,427
Now that we know
who porked whom,

64
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,163
let's go over who murdered whom.

65
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,698
Penny?

66
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,673
You're Kady.

67
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,772
What's going on?

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,045
I'm not your Penny.

69
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,062
Julia?

70
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,671
Sorry, uh, what?

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,504
What I'm saying is, if there's
a monster behind the door,

72
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,601
opening the door is
probably not the smartest plan.

73
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,170
But that's where magic is, like...
What, we can't exactly just stop.

74
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,409
Plus, this didn't come from
the most reliable source.

75
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,815
He was you.

76
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,079
He was The Beast.

77
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,281
Making decisions like this without
understanding the consequences

78
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,586
is exactly why magic is gone.

79
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,253
So we figure out if it's true.

80
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,889
We... We search the
castle, find out what's inside.

81
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,863
We could ask the Library.

82
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,371
Yeah, you're right.
You should ask them.

83
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,134
They say they want to help.

84
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,573
It'd be nice if
they actually did.

85
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,201
I'll let you know what they say.

86
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,573
Q...

87
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,809
Do you have a better plan?

88
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,684
Yeah, maybe don't
trust the Library?

89
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,054
They literally snort
the bones of fairies.

90
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,717
We don't have to trust them.

91
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,869
The Penny that you
brought with you,

92
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,191
the... Penny 23.

93
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,285
Yeah, look.

94
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,991
Ask him to follow
Alice to the Library.

95
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,899
He can Astral Project, they'll
never even know he was there.

96
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,832
Catching up on the news?

97
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,202
My timeline was
post-apocalyptic,

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,076
and it wasn't this fucked up.

99
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,781
Alice is meeting
with the Library.

100
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,081
We need you to follow
her on the Astral Plane.

101
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,384
Q thinks you're more
likely to say yes if I ask,

102
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,256
because you and the
other me shared a thing.

103
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,851
But we both know that
we're total strangers.

104
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,453
So... Go on.

105
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,599
Well... See, this is a
chance to unfuck magic.

106
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,097
And as a new
citizen of Timeline 40,

107
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,039
that should be something
you would want to do.

108
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,439
Whoever asks.

109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,711
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

110
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,045
It was built by the gods, but its
contents are secret by design.

111
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,086
All we mortals know is that
we are not meant to know.

112
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,054
Why wouldn't they want
you to know what's inside?

113
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,887
Perhaps it is indeed the
lair of a horrifying monster.

114
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,292
Or perhaps they simply
enjoy tormenting those of us

115
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,627
who dedicate our lives
to cataloging information.

116
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,825
Well, whatever their motive,

117
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,959
we'd be idiots to
go in totally blind.

118
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,799
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

119
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,894
A god.

120
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,600
I believe your friends have
had encounters with them.

121
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,200
Now, there is another matter.

122
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,086
That's the Siphon?

123
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,451
We thought it'd be bigger.

124
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,723
It needs to be powered,
and it requires a lot of energy.

125
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,061
Our intended source has not
fulfilled their end of our bargain.

126
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,466
Well, how am I
supposed to use it?

127
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,004
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

128
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,438
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

129
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,476
She'd never go for that if
she knew what this does.

130
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,907
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

131
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,250
That could kill her.

132
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,718
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

133
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,823
We need the Siphon
charged before...

134
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,919
I know.

135
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,525
Hmm.

136
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,601
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

137
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,138
I'll be in touch.

138
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,869
Remember.

139
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,846
Once magic is flowing again, you
have 30 seconds to attach the Siphon.

140
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,746
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

141
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,563
I come bearing gifts.

142
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,398
This is, like, 80%
taco supplies.

143
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,268
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

144
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,808
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

145
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,242
No, no. If I have to
catch, pluck, or boil

146
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,440
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

147
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,248
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought I would be.

148
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,223
Listen, Fen.

149
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,057
Before you were born, you
were promised to a stranger.

150
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,152
A king.

151
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,498
And I'm not one anymore.

152
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,125
You don't have to
stay for my sake.

153
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm guessing you've never thought about
where I would be if you never showed up.

154
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,169
I have.

155
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,913
Still in that same
village where I was born,

156
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,940
married to one of the three
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

157
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,283
Now those boys want
to drop you off a waterfall,

158
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,323
and that's them being polite.

159
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,285
What do you think they would
do if they got their hands on me?

160
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,287
That got less
touching as you went.

161
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,799
I can't go back to my old life.

162
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,797
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

163
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,804
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

164
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,139
for the last key, but
this is what we got back.

165
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,320
Eat my ass! We're not sure if...

166
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,573
Eat my ass!

167
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,136
We're not sure
if... Eat. My. Ass!

168
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:39,311
If this was the Fairy Queen's
response or this is one very kinky rabbit.

169
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,083
Maybe there's something
we can do to get her attention?

170
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,646
Eat. My. Ass.

171
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,460
These are on the house.

172
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,894
For you saving my life.

173
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,261
We need to talk to your Queen.

174
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,129
You must know how
to get her to come.

175
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,065
It's an emergency. FRAY: No.

176
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,163
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

177
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,439
Glass half full. She didn't
actually go through with it.

178
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:06,344
But you must have fairy stepsisters
or someone you can talk to?

179
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,348
There were no fairy
children in the Realm.

180
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,977
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

181
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,816
Like me.

182
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,755
Being sent to you
ruined everything.

183
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,223
I can't go back to
the Fairy Realm,

184
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,520
I don't fit in with humans.

185
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,686
Why do you think I
work at an animal bar?

186
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,459
No, really, really,
I'm not judging you.

187
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,398
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

188
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:31,097
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

189
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,374
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked-up childhood.

190
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,103
But what we want
to offer the Queen

191
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,943
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

192
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,450
Maybe the distance between
us can finally start to close.

193
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,243
And maybe then, you
won't feel so alone.

194
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,948
That's kind.

195
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,584
But just so you
know, I'm not alone.

196
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,650
No, really.

197
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,855
Bye, Margo.

198
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,399
Bye, Humbledrum.

199
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,497
I love that bear.

200
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,067
So do I.

201
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,974
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we
were kind of having a moment.

202
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:14,242
No, honey, she "loves" him.

203
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,890
Uh, so not bear
boss. Bear boyfriend?

204
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,924
Is that a thing in Fillory?

205
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,190
Apparently, very taboo.

206
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,461
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

207
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,436
if I got my way, I'd say go
hog-wild or bear-wild or bull-wild.

208
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,996
He's very concerned
about getting your approval.

209
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,532
I don't think he quite gets that
you're not even Fray's real dad.

210
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,847
Well, then...

211
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,916
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

212
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,616
I'm so happy
you're dating a bear.

213
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,927
Thanks...

214
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,260
Dad.

215
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,425
Thanks, Fray's dad.

216
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,436
No problem.

217
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,039
That's all the Librarian knows.

218
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,300
We have to find someone
who's been inside the castle.

219
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,843
So...

220
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,879
A god. You say
that like it's easy.

221
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,314
Our Lady Underground
hasn't answered me in months.

222
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,580
Yeah, the only way to track
Bacchus down was his Instagram

223
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,986
and it looks like it got deleted
for terms of service violations.

224
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,455
Nipples, apparently.

225
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,923
Well, that's bullshit.

226
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,653
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

227
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,122
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

228
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,764
She's lying.

229
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,236
Not about the god
stuff, that's true.

230
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,672
It's what she's leaving out.

231
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,643
They have some sort of
metal thing called a "Siphon."

232
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,170
She's supposed to charge it
up by ripping out Julia's power,

233
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,876
which could kill her.

234
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,544
She didn't seem psyched about
the idea, but she didn't say no.

235
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,749
So, now what?

236
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,570
What's that? Truth Key?

237
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,242
If it was, I'd tell
you to go away.

238
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,272
Unity.

239
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,378
The walkie-talkie key.

240
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,542
You're trying to talk
to the other Penny.

241
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:35,084
No offense... You're
the "other Penny".

242
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,818
Look.

243
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,593
I don't blame you. You're
just trying to survive.

244
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:48,658
It's... It's everyone else.

245
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,401
Acting like finding
you is enough,

246
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:57,740
when our Penny, the
real Penny, is out there.

247
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,141
Down there.

248
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,944
And maybe if...

249
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,019
If we talk to him,
we could help him.

250
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,249
What?

251
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:16,126
Just... All that shit that
you did for the other me.

252
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,674
The only person that
would have done that for me

253
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,634
on my timeline is Julia.

254
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,798
Yeah, well...

255
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,737
Our Julia is different.

256
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,644
She is not the person you loved.

257
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,509
You don't owe me anything.

258
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,211
But for what it's worth, it'd
be helpful if you explained it.

259
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,950
How she's different.

260
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,801
What about Reynard?

261
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,309
What happened to him
after OLU. took him away?

262
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,811
I don't know.

263
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:10,381
But it was his spark that
Our Lady gave to Julia.

264
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,351
I know it's not about me.

265
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,913
None of it ever
really felt about me.

266
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,549
So I've, uh...

267
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,462
Never really known how to deal
with how angry I am at all of it.

268
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,058
Wait, so he could be out there?

269
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,330
Still a god, but powerless?

270
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,738
I guess.

271
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,846
And only gods know
what's behind the door.

272
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,479
No.

273
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,813
We have to find Reynard.

274
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,800
Thank you for coming. I actually
have nothing to say to you.

275
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,529
I know what you want.

276
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,235
And I can't give it to you.

277
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,431
We get it.

278
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,066
Humans will chop you
up and snort your innards.

279
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,373
But not all humans are
like that, you know that.

280
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,468
We aren't.

281
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,639
I told Julia about our key

282
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,878
to give you all a chance
to give up on your quest.

283
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,782
We aren't questing,
we are surrendering.

284
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,218
We are giving you what you want,

285
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,622
a nice, quiet, moist-as-hell
spot on Fillory for you to settle.

286
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,523
And you give us the key.

287
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,188
Or... I walk away.

288
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,630
And when the Lorians,
Floaters, and Western Hordes

289
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,157
are done with
Fillory, I can take it.

290
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,669
All of it.

291
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,764
Our lifespans dwarf
even the dwarves.

292
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,742
We can wait for what we want.

293
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,746
Oh, but you can't, can you?

294
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,381
You see, Fray, well, she told us

295
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,113
that there are no fairy
children in your realm.

296
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,418
So... That's a prob.

297
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,516
That's why you planted your eggs
in the Northern Orchard, isn't it?

298
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,584
You can't reproduce
in the Fairy Realm.

299
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,960
Without Fillory, you go extinct.

300
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,832
Fine, ignore the problem.

301
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,301
Your egg hole's
only getting dustier.

302
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,838
You no longer speak
for the people of Fillory.

303
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,773
Tick Pickwick does.

304
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,107
And he has no
interest in a deal.

305
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,146
If you want my key,
come back with a crown.

306
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,844
Or an army.

307
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,220
I pray to you, Our
Lady Underground.

308
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,786
Please don't be
withholding for once.

309
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,130
<i>God damn it!</i>

310
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,428
Hello?

311
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,201
Dean Fogg?

312
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,304
Were you talking in here?

313
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,870
No, I was not. Why?

314
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,883
I... I woke up this morning
with this ringing in my ears.

315
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,889
You should get that checked.

316
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,982
By someone who isn't me.

317
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,720
But it's not just that.

318
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,161
I can feel what other
people are feeling.

319
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,327
You were given
the power of a god.

320
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,703
Spiritual people might say
that you're hearing prayers.

321
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,703
I heard you.

322
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,544
I felt something
coming from you.

323
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,509
What, exactly?

324
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,676
Desperation.

325
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,663
Look, I think that I'm
supposed to help you...

326
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,623
No, I do not need your help.

327
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,386
Yes, you do.

328
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,283
Your eyes...

329
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,660
Were injured magically, and fixing
them with magic risks changing

330
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,494
the very core of who I am.

331
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,795
Do you understand?

332
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,062
Yes.

333
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,467
If you did it, or
another Magician.

334
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,373
But that's not
what I am, exactly.

335
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,174
If I'm hearing prayers, I'm supposed
to do something about them.

336
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,740
Why give me this otherwise?

337
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,359
You know, I put a little
leftover pigeon in my taco,

338
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,560
and it's really... Really bad.

339
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,764
We need the key
to get back magic.

340
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,739
We need our
thrones to get the key.

341
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,002
We need magic
to get our thrones.

342
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,635
It is an ouroboros of ass.

343
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,738
Maybe King Idri and the Stone
Queen will back our claims.

344
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,443
We defeat Tick's
army, storm the castle...

345
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,541
Yes, and,

346
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,110
what if we replace the part
where we kill everyone with...

347
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,656
Oh, off the top of
my head, democracy?

348
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,090
Like we were going to do
before magic got borked?

349
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,004
Tick's the only one who
can call for an election,

350
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,792
and he's got nothing to gain.

351
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,827
Oh, he'll call
for it, all right.

352
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,165
Josh, I need you
to go to Kinko's.

353
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,872
<i>Election? What is this?</i>

354
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,940
There are thousands of them.

355
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,443
They were falling from the sky.

356
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:42,107
Over villages,
farms, a brothel...

357
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,777
I... Happened
to... Be walking by.

358
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,581
Collect them all and burn them.

359
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,645
Of course, your grumpiness.

360
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,853
But as Abigail
wisely reminded me,

361
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,521
the citizens now believe
they're getting elections.

362
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,155
You'd have to be the one
to announce they're not.

363
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,931
Given the revolutionary mood
the people have been in recently...

364
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,996
Your plan worked.

365
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,770
Tick already started putting
up his own campaign flyers.

366
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,710
Of course it worked.
Giving people shit is easy.

367
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,838
Taking it away is
almost impossible.

368
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,509
Like Obamacare.

369
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,812
Or herpes.

370
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,876
Too true, Bambi.

371
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:26,017
Speaking of difficult conversations with
a former lover, do you have a second?

372
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,084
Why the fuck shouldn't
my name be on that ballot?

373
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,186
Because we are running for king.

374
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,731
We can call the job whatever
we want after we win it.

375
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,098
It has been a struggle to bring
this place into the 20th century.

376
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,168
Yes, 20th,

377
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,467
because when we got here,
it was straight-up Dark Ages,

378
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,778
and we have to start somewhere.

379
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,536
Yeah, we're really
civilizing them.

380
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,608
What should we teach
them next, to outlaw abortion?

381
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,010
Women don't want to work?
Wage gaps? Thigh gaps?

382
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,674
Fillory is patriarchal.

383
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,184
And we've got to put
our best foot forward.

384
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,913
And I'm sorry, but in this case,

385
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,353
our foot should have a dick.

386
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,585
What, Josh?

387
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:05,494
Do you have some patronizing
bullshit to tell me, too?

388
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,500
No. Could you drop me
off at the Earth portal tree?

389
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,536
I have an idea, but I need...

390
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,162
Me?

391
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,536
How did you...

392
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,075
Yeah, I have no idea.

393
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,166
Hi, Margo.

394
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,212
I felt you needed my help.

395
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,773
And now I'm here.
It's been a weird day.

396
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,611
Can't believe I did this.

397
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,946
This forest fed so many people.

398
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,789
Not for nothing, but when
I was at my lowest point,

399
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,555
that tiny spell you showed me,

400
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,961
it's what got me
back in the fight.

401
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,627
Magic is the thing that makes
the Children of Earth special.

402
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,296
All I'm asking is, try.

403
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,154
Vote Children of Earth.

404
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,632
Vote Children of Earth.

405
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,703
Vote the Children of Earth!

406
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,002
Step right up, grab a poster.

407
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,653
We need to talk.

408
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,985
Look, Quentin...

409
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,786
What is a Siphon?

410
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,054
And why do you
need Julia to power it?

411
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,356
You spied on me?

412
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,828
What does it do?

413
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:22,294
It's a safeguard. That's all.

414
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,860
The Library wants
to turn magic back on.

415
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,281
And once it's back on,
they want to make sure

416
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,366
it doesn't get used for the
wrong things by the wrong people.

417
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,376
So, the Siphon diverts

418
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:35,505
magic to the Library so that
they can choose who can use it?

419
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,914
Look, you took a test
to get into Brakebills.

420
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,011
If you failed, you would
have gotten sent away,

421
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,646
with no memory of magic.

422
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,281
Happily ignorant.

423
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:51,126
But because a group of smart individuals
made a judgment call, they let you in.

424
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,690
Why should the
Library get to choose?

425
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,258
They're corrupt,
they're killers.

426
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,803
Yeah, so are we.

427
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:02,573
At least they have the
information, the perspective.

428
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,008
You love magic, and you're
probably the best there is at it.

429
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,109
You're terrified of
what you'll do with it.

430
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,245
I have reason to be.

431
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,878
I don't know everything
that you did as a Niffin,

432
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:19,289
but I know that people make mistakes
so that they can change and do better.

433
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,691
But only if they're
given the chance.

434
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,889
Taking away choice
is not the answer.

435
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,130
There are seven keys,
and we have eight questers.

436
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,671
We can do this
without you, and we will.

437
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,764
Unless you give me the Siphon.

438
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,857
Just remember that
when magic was turned off,

439
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,021
your dad went into remission, Q.

440
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,428
And once you turn it back on,

441
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,194
his cancer comes
back, and he dies.

442
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,143
Straw polls are in, and
our ratings are way up.

443
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,872
I mean, off the charts.

444
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,710
Julia has done us
the solidest solid.

445
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:19,183
After the trees, she grew
food for the starving peasants.

446
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,583
She fixed the dry wells.

447
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,984
She even helped this one
guy's bajanked case of head lice.

448
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:28,426
I mean, Children of
Earth are back on top!

449
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:36,001
Her Flealessness suggests that your
time as high king has been so brief,

450
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,505
the Fillorian people don't
yet know what you stand for.

451
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,301
I stand for them.

452
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,808
I stand for economic stability.

453
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,142
For a solid,
well-researched strategy.

454
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,510
That's it.

455
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,745
I'm going to tell them,
in detail, my plan.

456
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,413
Rafe, write this down.

457
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:01,620
My fellow Fillorians, I hereby
set forth my policy to restore

458
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,494
economic and societal
growth to a reunified Fillory...

459
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,400
Blah, blah, blah,
blah. So uninspiring.

460
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:14,372
Does he really think he can
win by boring them to death?

461
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,533
Josh!

462
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,344
I hereby declare
all native Fillorians

463
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,040
shall receive ten free
sacks of grain every year.

464
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,592
And how exactly are we
supposed to grow that much grain,

465
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,244
even with magic?

466
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,981
You're making a
promise you can't keep.

467
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,819
Bambi, first rule
of politics on Earth.

468
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,256
<i>All you have to do is say it.</i>

469
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,760
<i>It doesn't have to be true.</i>

470
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,392
I hereby declare,
under my administration,

471
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,264
<i>low-interest loans for
all new infrastructure.</i>

472
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,200
Easy. No-interest loans.

473
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,947
<i>And we're going to
build Fillory's first...</i>

474
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,963
"Power... Plants."

475
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,800
Like, geraniums?

476
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:57,040
Will Tick's granular policies
keep you warm at night?

477
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,846
<i>No. You know what will?</i>

478
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,216
<i>Extending the Fillorian summer.</i>

479
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,255
My proposition for
growth in new sectors...

480
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,291
Free healthcare for
all! Based on rigorous

481
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,383
survey research...
Champagne fountains

482
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,571
<i>in every village.</i> PICKWICK:
<i>The abatement of dependency</i>

483
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,893
on the Golden Goose standard.

484
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:11,987
Wealth!

485
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:15,193
<i>Regulation of agricultural waste
to prevent environmental runoff.</i>

486
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,431
Feasts. Annual famine
and rampant poverty.

487
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,597
Boat parties!

488
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,004
Three cheers for Eliot!

489
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,168
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

490
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,907
Eliot, I am so
sorry. What is it?

491
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,380
Tick's campaign just leaked

492
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,280
the transcript from your trial.

493
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,650
You mean the one where he called
Fillory "a malodorous shithole"?

494
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,079
<i>It's already hit the posts.</i>

495
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,186
Son of a Pickwick.

496
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,463
Julia, what the fuck...

497
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,969
There's a little
boy in Syracuse.

498
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,502
I can feel his parents praying.

499
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,946
I know if I just focus enough,
I can bring down his fever.

500
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,610
I feel bad interrupting this.

501
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,915
But we need your
help with something.

502
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,184
Finding Reynard.

503
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,148
I know.

504
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,327
But we need to talk to a god.

505
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,920
I want to help you, but...

506
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,123
Julia.

507
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,599
You have all the power now.

508
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,429
Yeah, but he's
still a trickster.

509
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,472
We don't know
what he's capable of.

510
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:31,772
Look, nobody hates that
he's still alive more than me.

511
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:37,011
But if we don't do it, we're
at a complete standstill.

512
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:41,617
All you'd have to
do is locate him,

513
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:45,624
power up Penny's tattoos,
and we'll take it from there.

514
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,557
You can also say no.

515
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,263
I'm not going to
send you there alone.

516
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,333
Great.

517
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,479
All right, I'll get the
stuff for the locator.

518
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,732
There's no need.

519
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,233
I can feel him with my mind.

520
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,110
You guys ready?

521
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,407
Wait, what are you...

522
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,709
This is the place.

523
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,949
He's nearby.

524
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,191
I have to say, this is
pretty disappointing.

525
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,454
Yeah.

526
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:26,092
We were all kind of hoping to find
Reynard showering in a Russian prison.

527
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,370
Oh, shit.

528
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:47,915
Roxane Gay, bell
hooks, feminist lit?

529
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,081
What, are you saving these

530
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,022
for a rapist book-burning party?

531
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,750
I've changed.

532
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,557
Living amongst the
humans has given me

533
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,291
a whole new perspective.

534
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:04,064
You're still a liar and pathetic,
but I guess you always were.

535
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,831
Why are you here?

536
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,270
What could I have that
you could possibly want?

537
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,370
Let's talk about the Castle
at the End of the World.

538
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,675
What's inside?

539
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,877
How do you guys
know about that place?

540
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,611
Answer her question.

541
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,221
You're not thinking of
going there, are you?

542
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,299
You know there's a reason
the gods had the Architect

543
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,985
put it at the end of the world?

544
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,151
"The Architect"?

545
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,800
It's not for you
little guys to know.

546
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,193
It's funny...

547
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,189
'Cause from where I stand,
you're the little guy now.

548
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,469
You have all my
power, and look at you.

549
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,532
Trying to handle something
you cannot handle.

550
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,703
You should have kept your mouth
shut and stayed in your place.

551
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,111
You've gotten yourself
into some real trouble now.

552
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,706
You think it's easy being a god?

553
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,784
You feel that?

554
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,014
Your tiny spark

555
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:05,392
has grown bigger in me
than it could have ever in you.

556
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,796
You want the truth
about the Castle?

557
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,632
The Castle's where the gods
put the stuff they made before us.

558
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,467
The stuff that didn't work out.

559
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,201
Mistakes that never
should have happened.

560
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,402
Kinda like you. I
hope you do go.

561
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,106
Open that door,
see what happens!

562
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,547
No!

563
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,756
Recognize it?

564
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,599
Yeah.

565
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,433
I made it to kill him.

566
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,768
How did you get this?

567
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,535
Did Our Lady give it to you?

568
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,303
Of course not.

569
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,505
My mother left me here to rot.

570
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,824
My stepfather Hades was the
only one that took pity on me.

571
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,682
He slipped me that gun to shoot
myself in case of emergency.

572
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,447
I'm still a god.

573
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,751
Limp or not, we're hard to kill.

574
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,529
What are you willing to
bet this god-killing bullet

575
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,565
will work on the
monster in the Castle?

576
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,328
The fate of the world?

577
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,105
That's good enough for me.

578
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,606
Whoa, that's it?

579
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,405
You're just going
to leave him there?

580
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,243
After what he did
to the both of you?

581
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,409
Shoot him.

582
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,887
Kady, you wanted this.

583
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,254
I wanted him to be
punished for what he did.

584
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,557
And he is.

585
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:45,894
Leave him here.

586
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,310
I am here to deliver the
official election results.

587
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,575
Eliot has lost.

588
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,611
Shocker.

589
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,380
Uh...

590
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,944
Tick has also lost.

591
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,548
Um, what?

592
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,524
Our new High King...

593
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,788
Is Margo.

594
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,892
But I... I wasn't
even on the ballot.

595
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,904
You won as a write-in.

596
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,496
Who wrote me in?

597
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,438
The talking animals.

598
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,239
It seems you were the only
human on the campaign trail

599
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,939
who stopped to listen
to their concerns.

600
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,244
You mean that drunk bear?

601
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:41,082
Humbledrum is a highly respected
member of the community.

602
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:47,285
You see, there are certain taboo
subjects you broached with him.

603
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,294
Bestiality?

604
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,330
The talking animals believe

605
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,374
that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

606
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,266
then humans will finally
see them as equals.

607
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:02,274
None of us were brave enough to speak
out in support of the cause, until you.

608
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,570
You really love
that sloth, don't you?

609
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:14,342
So the human vote basically
means nothing in Fillory.

610
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,480
Considering there's never been
an election or census before,

611
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,924
we had no idea there were
only 50,000 humans in Fillory,

612
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:25,623
and upwards of a
million talking animals.

613
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,689
So... Yes.

614
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,769
On behalf of Abigail,
let me be the first

615
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,365
to swear loyalty to
the new administration.

616
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:39,944
El...

617
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,777
I'm so sorry.

618
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,327
And allow me to be the second.

619
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,028
High King Margo.
Long may you reign.

620
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,774
Hey, Tick.

621
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:47,643
I intend to choose Death
by a Thousand Pokes.

622
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,409
They say you only feel
the first hundred or so.

623
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,007
Tick, we're not
going to execute you.

624
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,075
If you proved anything
during your campaign,

625
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,919
it's that Fillory needs
a policy wonk like you.

626
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,016
You're still
bitch-listed, but...

627
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,186
King Margo would
like you in her cabinet.

628
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,627
With a full 24-hour security
detail watching everything you do.

629
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,865
We don't trust you,
but we need you.

630
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,971
Citizenship for every fairy,
full protection of the law,

631
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,640
and a seat in the government.

632
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,944
But we need the key.

633
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,780
And you shall have it.

634
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,821
Once the last fairies have
been moved to our new home.

635
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,848
I always saw something in you.

636
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,525
Even when you
didn't see it in yourself.

637
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,699
Now, perhaps you will.

638
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,775
You gave me...

639
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,647
I can... I can see
all sorts of things.

640
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,843
It's a fairy eye.

641
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:03,150
A gift you will learn
to understand in time.

642
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,517
But one you must
hide in plain sight.

643
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,123
Could I maybe get
some fairy toes?

644
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,632
Hello?

645
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,478
<i>Cranky as shit.</i>

646
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,962
<i>Just take a little off the top.</i>

647
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,716
<i>I just collapsed
my entire rental.</i>

648
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,916
<i>Last time, we
were...</i> Oh, my God...

649
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,515
<i>Are we supposed to sing again?</i>

650
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,458
<i>- Holy shit, no.
- We've got news!</i>

651
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,052
Penny, is that you? PENNY: <i>Yeah.</i>

652
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,973
<i>We just got the last
key from the fairies.</i>

653
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,933
Okay, everyone just
shut up! It's Penny.

654
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,491
All right, look, listen.

655
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,912
I don't know how
much time we have.

656
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,598
<i>Kady.</i> But I'm
going to get you out

657
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,140
of the Underworld, no
matter what it takes, I promise.

658
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,608
<i>Kady.</i> I love you.

659
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,611
This is Penny 23.

660
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,948
The key replaced
my Penny with you.

661
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,851
Look, I'm really sorry.

662
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,821
This is it.

663
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,030
The end of the story.

664
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,125
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

665
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,797
Q? What's up, what's wrong?

666
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,873
The quest is
supposed to change us.

667
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,175
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

668
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,806
up to this point,
and I... I can't...

669
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,646
You thought that
when you got here,

670
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,848
you'd be 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

671
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,784
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

672
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,589
Because you're
worried about your dad.

673
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,028
Party trick.

674
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,497
I just feel things.

675
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,802
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

676
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,430
Maybe...

677
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,771
I could heal your dad?

678
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,608
Right now, he's
perfectly healthy.

679
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,341
There's nothing to do.

680
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,143
If magic comes back,

681
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:17,713
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

682
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,349
I don't know if I'll be
able to help or not.

683
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,889
It's the deal.

684
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,024
Sorry it's vague.

685
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,234
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

686
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,544
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

687
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,557
Then the quest fucked up
when it chose Quentin Coldwater.

688
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,727
Maybe.

689
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,596
It's all real.

690
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,603
The Chatwins and Fillory.

691
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,438
I've been there.

692
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,210
I... I sat on a throne
in Whitespire, and I...

693
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,814
I explored the Flying Forest.

694
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,685
And I... Met Ember and Umber.

695
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,589
I remember reading
you those books.

696
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,462
Curly Q...

697
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,766
If all that's out there...

698
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,402
What are you doing here?

699
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,437
I'm on a quest.

700
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,639
In New Jersey?

701
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,643
I have a problem.

702
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,174
And I don't know what to do.

703
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,341
No matter what choice I
make, somebody gets hurt.

704
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,080
Magic's gone.

705
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,448
Isn't it?

706
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,450
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

707
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,021
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

708
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,865
And I knew it
wasn't a coincidence

709
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,902
when I went into
remission a week later.

710
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,993
You're right.

711
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,363
My friends and I
were trying to fix it.

712
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,203
And how's that been going?

713
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,475
We're getting really close.

714
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,044
So are you here to
ask my permission?

715
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,211
To...

716
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,389
Turn it back on?

717
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,984
On this quest...

718
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,388
I've lived a whole life.

719
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,168
I grew old, and I got
married. And I had a son.

720
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,806
Who grew old.

721
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,809
And what was all that
for if it's not for this?

722
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:02,047
No, I'm not here to
ask for your permission.

723
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,326
I wanted to look you in the eye

724
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,261
and tell you that I'm sorry.

725
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,258
I don't know what's
going to happen.

726
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,800
But I'm going to do this.

727
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,512
What was his name?

728
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,241
Your son.

729
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,752
I named him after you.
