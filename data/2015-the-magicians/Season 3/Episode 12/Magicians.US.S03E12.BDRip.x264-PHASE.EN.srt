Previously on "Us"...

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,608
What?
Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,947
<i>A group of fine-looking grad students
were invited to a secret school far magic</i>

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,823
<i>where</i> a <i>bunch of stuff happened
that doesn't really matter,</i>

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,887
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,694
The answer to a riddle
they didn't even know to ask.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,165
It's you.

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,702
Do you want
this recap or not?

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,500
So, yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,974
<i>For a minute.
We became kings and queens.</i>

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,341
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,212
Everyone hooked up. <i>I</i> had a
threesome with two harpies.

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,580
Skip to the parts
about me.

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,711
JOSH: You had a Jot <i>of</i>
drama with your hands.

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,847
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

16
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,221
<i>to help out Kady.</i>

17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,918
Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,494
JOSH: <i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>Looks like she could crack open
your balls, because she can?</i>

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,537
<i>Well, it was a love
for the ages.</i>

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,573
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

22
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,663
<i>with some hedge witches.</i>

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,835
Especially her best bitch, Julia Wicker.
Their term, not mine.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
(STAMMERS)
l would never.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,346
Whatever went down definitely
made them ex-best...

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,739
Witches.

27
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,581
Truthfully, the only person
Kady can stand is you.

28
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,781
And that pretty much
cut both ways.

29
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,915
No, come on, Penny, don't...
Don't... Come on.

30
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,584
<i>JOSH: And then
you died. Kind of.</i>

31
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,187
Meanwhile, magic
got all jacked up.

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,534
You know what's weird,
that "jacked up" is bad,

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,570
but "jacked off" is great.

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,763
Focus, dude.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,639
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of fairy dicks

36
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,904
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,640
<i>so the people revolted.</i>

38
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,770
<i>Only ray of how?</i>

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,042
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,142
Why? Question mark!

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,916
<i>We got sent on</i> a <i>dope quest to find
the Seven Keys that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,483
<i>But the fourth one got dragon-gobbled
and lost Mm the Underworld.</i>

43
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,120
The other Penny sent us the
key, but never came back.

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,927
Then came
my grand adventure.

45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,990
Hard pass.

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,934
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

47
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,803
And snagged up key seven.
Yeah, I was there for that.

48
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,135
You didn't save shit.

49
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,938
Now wait, you skipped
the Sixth Key.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,673
This makes no goddamn sense.

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,578
No, it's intentionally
confusing.

52
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,915
<i>You see, Julia saved a bunch
of fairies from slavery,</i>

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,750
<i>so the Fairy Queen was like,
"I have the Sixth Key,</i>

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,484
<i>“but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's..."</i>

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,924
A creamy bitch
is what she is.

56
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,588
JULIA: <i>Meanwhile, Alice
has been acting real fishy.</i>

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,756
Quentin was all like...

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,820
Are you working
for the Library?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,422
And she was all...
Yes.

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,096
And now, if you would please refer
to the hookup/murder chart.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,003
Penny got with
the other Alice.

62
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,130
Interesting.

63
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,437
Now that we know
who perked whom,

64
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,174
let's go over
who murdered whom.

65
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,709
KADY: Penny?

66
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,844
(EXCLAIMS)

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,684
You're Kady.

68
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,783
What's going on?

69
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,056
I'm not your Penny.

70
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,662
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

71
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,478
(INDISTINCT WHISPERS)

72
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,073
QUENTIN: Julia'?

73
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,672
Sorry, uh, what?

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,515
What I'm saying is, if there's
a monster behind the door,

75
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,577
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

76
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,181
But that's where magic is, like...
What, we can't exactly just stop.

77
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,386
Plus, this didn't come
from the most reliable source.

78
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,826
He was you.

79
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,056
He was The Beast.

80
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,258
Making decisions like this without
understanding the consequences

81
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,596
is exactly
why magic is gone.

82
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,229
So we figure out
if it's true.

83
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,900
We... We search the castle,
find out what's inside.

84
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,874
We could ask the Library.

85
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,382
Yeah, you're right.
You should ask them.

86
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,111
They say they
want to help.

87
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,584
It'd be nice
if they actually did.

88
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,212
I'll let you know
what they say.

89
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,584
Q...

90
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,786
Do you have
a better plan?

91
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,695
JULIA: Yeah, maybe
don't trust the Library?

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,065
They literally snort
the bones of fairies.

93
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,728
We don't have
to trust them.

94
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,770
The Penny that you
brought with you,

95
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,201
the...
Penny 23.

96
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
Yeah, look.

97
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,968
Ask him to follow
Alice to the Library.

98
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,909
He can Astral Project, they'll
never even know he was there.

99
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,877
Catching up on the news?

100
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,213
My timeline was
post-apocalyptic,

101
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,087
and it wasn't
this fucked up.

102
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,792
Alice is meeting
with the Library.

103
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,091
We need you to follow her
on the Astral Plane.

104
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,394
Q thinks you're more likely
to say yes if I ask,

105
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,267
because you and the other
me shared a thing.

106
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,828
But we both know
that we're total strangers.

107
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,464
So...
Go on.

108
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,610
Well... See, this is
a chance to unfuck magic.

109
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,108
And as a new citizen
of Timeline 40,

110
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,015
that should be something
you would want to do.

111
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,450
Whoever asks.

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,688
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

113
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,022
It was built by the gods, but its
contents are secret by design.

114
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,097
All we mortals know is that
we are not meant to know.

115
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,031
Why wouldn't they want you
to know what's inside?

116
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,864
Perhaps it is indeed the lair
of a horrifying monster.

117
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,303
Or perhaps they simply enjoy
tormenting those of us

118
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,638
who dedicate our lives
to cataloging information.

119
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,836
Well, whatever
their motive,

120
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,970
we'd be idiots
to go in totally blind.

121
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,810
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

122
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,871
A god.

123
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,611
I believe your friends
have had encounters with them.

124
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,211
Now, there is
another matter.

125
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,131
ALICE: That's the Siphon?

126
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,461
We thought it'd be bigger.

127
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,699
It needs to be powered, and
it requires a lot of energy.

128
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,072
Our intended source has not
fulfilled their end of our bargain.

129
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,476
Well, how am I
supposed to use it?

130
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,015
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

131
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,415
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

132
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,487
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,918
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

134
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,260
That could kill her.

135
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,729
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

136
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,834
We need the Siphon
charged before...

137
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,930
I know.

138
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,536
Hmm.

139
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,611
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

140
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,115
I'll be in touch.

141
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,880
Remember.

142
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,857
Once magic is flowing again, you have
30 seconds to attach the Siphon.

143
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,757
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

144
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,574
JOSH: I come bearing gifts.

145
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,409
This is, like,
80% taco supplies.

146
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,279
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

147
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,784
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

148
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,253
No, no. If I have to catch,
pluck, or boil

149
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,451
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

150
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,259
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought I would be.

151
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,597
(SIGHS)

152
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,234
Listen, Fen.

153
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,068
Before you were born, you were
promised to a stranger.

154
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,163
A king.

155
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,509
And I'm not one anymore.

156
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,136
You don't have
to stay for my sake.

157
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,951
I'm guessing you've never thought about
where I would be if you never showed up.

158
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,180
I have.

159
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,924
Still in that same village
where I was born,

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,951
married to one of the three
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

161
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,294
Now those boys want to
drop you off a waterfall,

162
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,334
and that's them being polite.

163
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,296
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

164
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,297
That got less touching
as you went.

165
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,810
I can't go back
to my old life.

166
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,807
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

167
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,815
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

168
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,150
for the last key, but this
is what we got back.

169
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,211
Eat my ass!
We're not sure if...

170
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,550

171
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,147
We're not sure if...
Eat. My. Ass!

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,320
If this was the Fairy Queen's response
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

173
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,060
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

174
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,657
BUNNY: Eat. My. Ass.

176
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,471
FRAY: These are
on the house.

177
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,871
For you saving my life.

178
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,237
We need to talk
to your Queen.

179
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,140
You must know how
to get her to come.

180
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,042
It's an emergency.
FRAY: No.

181
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,174
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

182
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,412
Glass half full. She didn't
actually go through with it.

183
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:06,355
But you must have fairy stepsisters
or someone you can talk to?

184
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,359
There were no fairy
children in the Realm.

185
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,988
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

186
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,827
Like me.

187
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,731
Being sent to you
ruined everything.

188
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,234
I can't go back
to the Fairy Realm,

189
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,530
I don't fit in with humans.

190
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,697
Why do you think
I work at an animal bar?

191
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,436
No, really, really,
I'm not judging you.

192
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,409
Trust me,
I'm not judging you.

193
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,107
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

194
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,385
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked-up childhood.

195
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,079
But what we want
to offer the Queen

196
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,919
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

197
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,460
Maybe the distance between us
can finally start to close.

198
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,254
And maybe then,
you won't feel so alone.

199
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,923
That's kind.

200
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,595
But just so you know,
I'm not alone.

204
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,542
I love that bear.

205
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,078
So do I.

206
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,951
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we
were kind of having a moment.

207
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:14,253
No, honey, she "loves" him.

208
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,901
Uh, so not bear boss.
Bear boyfriend?

209
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,935
Is that a thing in Fillory?

210
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,167
Apparently, very taboo.

211
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,472
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

212
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,446
if I got my way, I'd say go
hog-wild or bear-wild or bull-wild.

213
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,984
He's very concerned
about getting your approval.

214
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,577
I don't think he quite gets that
you're not even Fray's real dad.

215
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,857
Well, then...

216
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,926
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

217
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,627
I'm so happy
you're dating a bear.

218
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,937
Thanks...

219
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,271

00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,436
HUMBLEDRUM:
Thanks, Fray's dad.

221
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,447
No problem.

ALICE: That's all
the Librarian knows.

223
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,311
We have to find someone
who's been inside the castle.

224
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,854

225
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,889
A god. You say that
like it's easy.

226
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,324
Our Lady Underground
hasn't answered me in months.

227
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,556
Yeah, the only way to track
Bacchus down was his lnstagram

228
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,997
and it looks like it got deleted
for terms of service violations.

229
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,466
Nipples, apparently.

230
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,900
Well, that's bullshit.

231
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,664
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

232
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,133
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

233
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,809
She's lying.

234
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,213
Not about the god stuff,
that's true.

235
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,683
It's what
she's leaving out.

236
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,654
They have some sort of
metal thing called a "Siphon."

237
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,181
She's supposed to charge it up
by ripping out Julia's power,

238
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,886
which could kill her.

239
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,555
She didn't seem psyched about the
idea, but she didn't say no.

240
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,759
So, now what?

241
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,581
PENNY 23: What's that?
Truth Key'?

242
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,253

to go away.

You're the "other Penny“.

we could help him.

you did for the other me.

would have done that for me

She is not the person
you loved.

You don't owe me anything.

264
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,199
But for what it's worth, it'd
be helpful if you explained it.

265
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,961
How she's different

266
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,812

after OLU. took him away?

268
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,822
I don't know.

269
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:10,358
But it was his spark
that Our Lady gave to Julia.

270

I know it's
not about me.

None of it ever
really felt about me.

could be out there?

next, to outlaw abortion?

691
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,959
The key replaced
my Penny with you.

692
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,894
Look, I'm really sorry.

693
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,230
(CLATTERS)

694
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,770
(BREATH TREMBLES)

695
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,832
JULIA: This is it.

696
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,064
The end of the story.

697
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,135
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

698
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,808
Q? What's up,
what's wrong?

699
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,849
The quest is supposed
to change us.

700
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,151
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

701
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,817
up to this point,
and I... I can't...

702
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,657
You thought that
when you got here,

703
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,858
you'd be 150% sure you were
doing the right thing.

704
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,795
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

705
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,600
Because you're worried
about your dad.

706
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,039
Party trick.

707
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,506
L just feel things.

708
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,812
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

709
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,441
Maybe...

710
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,782
I could heal your dad?

711
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,619
Rig ht now,
he's perfectly healthy.

712
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,352
There's nothing to do.

713
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,154
If magic comes back,

714
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:17,689
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

715
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,360
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

716
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,900
It's the deal.

717
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,035
Sorry it's vague.

718
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,069
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

719
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,245
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

720
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,555
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

721
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,568
Then the quest fucked up when
it chose Quentin Goldwater.

722
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,728
Maybe.

723
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,607
It's all real.

724
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,613
The Chatwins and Fillory.

725
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,415
I've been there.

726
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,220
I... I sat on a throne
in Whitespire, and l...

727
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,791
I explored
the Flying Forest.

728
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,696
And I...
Met Ember and Umber.

729
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,859
(CHUCKLES)

730
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,598
I remember reading you
those books.

731
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,473
Curly Q...

732
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,777
If all that's out there...

733
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,413
What are you doing here?

734
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,448
I'm on a quest.

735
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,649
TED: In New Jersey?

736
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,653
I have a problem.

737
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,219
And I don't know
what to do.

738
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,386
No matter what choice I make,
somebody gets hurt.

739
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,091
Maggie's gone.

740
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,458
Isn't ii?

741
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,461
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

742
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,066
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

743
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,841
And I knew
it wasn't a coincidence

744
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,913
when I went into
remission a week later.

745
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,004
QUENTIN: You're right.

746
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,339
My friends and I
were trying to fix it.

747
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,248
And how's that been going?

748
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,485
We're getting
really close.

749
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,020
So are you here
to ask my permission?

750
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,256
To...

751
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,423
Turn it back on?

752
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,995
On this quest...

753
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,431
I've lived a whole life.

754
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,179
I grew old, and I got married.
And I had a son.

755
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,816
Who grew old.

756
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,820
And what was all that for
if it's not for this?

757
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:02,058
No, I'm not here
to ask for your permission.

758
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,337
I wanted to look you
in the eye

759
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,306
and tell you
that I'm sorry.

760
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,303
L don’t know
what's going to happen.

761
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,810
But I'm going to do this.

762
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,523
What was his name?

763
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,252
Your son.

764
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,763
I named him after you.
