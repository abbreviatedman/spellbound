Previously on "Us"...

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,608
What?
Just imagine a montage.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,947
<i>A group of fine-looking grad students
were invited to a secret school far magic</i>

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,823
<i>where</i> a <i>bunch of stuff happened
that doesn't really matter,</i>

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,887
<i>until they ran into
a mysterious figure.</i>

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,694
The answer to a riddle
they didn't even know to ask.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,165
It's you.

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,702
Do you want
this recap or not?

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,500
So, yeah, it was me.
Things were awesome.

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,974
<i>For a minute.
We became kings and queens.</i>

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,341
<i>Well, everybody but you.</i>

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,212
Everyone hooked up. <i>I</i> had a
threesome with two harpies.

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,580
Skip to the parts
about me.

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,711
JOSH: You had a Jot <i>of</i>
drama with your hands.

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,847
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

16
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,221
<i>to help out Kady.</i>

17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,918
Wait, who's that?

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,494
JOSH: <i>Kady Orloff-Diaz?
Love of your life?</i>

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>Looks like she could crack open
your balls, because she can?</i>

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,537
<i>Well, it was a love
for the ages.</i>

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,573
<i>Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head</i>

22
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,663
<i>with some hedge witches.</i>

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,835
Especially her best bitch, Julia Wicker.
Their term, not mine.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
(STAMMERS)
l would never.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,346
Whatever went down definitely
made them ex-best...

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,739
Witches.

27
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,581
Truthfully, the only person
Kady can stand is you.

28
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,781
And that pretty much
cut both ways.

29
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,915
No, come on, Penny, don't...
Don't... Come on.

30
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,584
<i>JOSH: And then
you died. Kind of.</i>

31
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,187
Meanwhile, magic
got all jacked up.

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,534
You know what's weird,
that "jacked up" is bad,

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,570
but "jacked off" is great.

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,763
Focus, dude.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,639
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of fairy dicks

36
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,904
<i>invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,</i>

37
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,640
<i>so the people revolted.</i>

38
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,770
<i>Only ray of how?</i>

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,042
<i>Julia mysteriously
still has magic.</i>

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,142
Why? Question mark!

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,916
<i>We got sent on</i> a <i>dope quest to find
the Seven Keys that unlock magic.</i>

42
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,483
<i>But the fourth one got dragon-gobbled
and lost Mm the Underworld.</i>

43
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,120
The other Penny sent us the
key, but never came back.

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,927
Then came
my grand adventure.

45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,990
Hard pass.

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,934
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

47
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,803
And snagged up key seven.
Yeah, I was there for that.

48
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,135
You didn't save shit.

49
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,938
Now wait, you skipped
the Sixth Key.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,673
This makes no goddamn sense.

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,578
No, it's intentionally
confusing.

52
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,915
<i>You see, Julia saved a bunch
of fairies from slavery,</i>

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,750
<i>so the Fairy Queen was like,
"I have the Sixth Key,</i>

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,484
<i>â€œbut I'm not going to give
it to you because she's..."</i>

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,924
A creamy bitch
is what she is.

56
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,588
JULIA: <i>Meanwhile, Alice
has been acting real fishy.</i>

57
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,756
Quentin was all like...

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,820
Are you working
for the Library?

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,422
And she was all...
Yes.

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,096
And now, if you would please refer
to the hookup/murder chart.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,003
Penny got with
the other Alice.

62
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,130
Interesting.

63
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,437
Now that we know
who perked whom,

64
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,174
let's go over
who murdered whom.

65
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,709
KADY: Penny?

66
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,844
(EXCLAIMS)

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,684
You're Kady.

68
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,783
What's going on?

69
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,056
I'm not your Penny.

70
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,662
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

71
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,478
(INDISTINCT WHISPERS)

72
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,073
QUENTIN: Julia'?

73
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,672
Sorry, uh, what?

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,515
What I'm saying is, if there's
a monster behind the door,

75
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,577
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

76
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,181
But that's where magic is, like...
What, we can't exactly just stop.

77
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,386
Plus, this didn't come
from the most reliable source.

78
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,826
He was you.

79
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,056
He was The Beast.

80
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,258
Making decisions like this without
understanding the consequences

81
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,596
is exactly
why magic is gone.

82
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,229
So we figure out
if it's true.

83
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,900
We... We search the castle,
find out what's inside.

84
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,874
We could ask the Library.

85
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,382
Yeah, you're right.
You should ask them.

86
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,111
They say they
want to help.

87
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,584
It'd be nice
if they actually did.

88
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,212
I'll let you know
what they say.

89
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,584
Q...

90
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,786
Do you have
a better plan?

91
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,695
JULIA: Yeah, maybe
don't trust the Library?

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,065
They literally snort
the bones of fairies.

93
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,728
We don't have
to trust them.

94
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,770
The Penny that you
brought with you,

95
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,201
the...
Penny 23.

96
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
Yeah, look.

97
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,968
Ask him to follow
Alice to the Library.

98
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,909
He can Astral Project, they'll
never even know he was there.

99
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,877
Catching up on the news?

100
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,213
My timeline was
post-apocalyptic,

101
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,087
and it wasn't
this fucked up.

102
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,792
Alice is meeting
with the Library.

103
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,091
We need you to follow her
on the Astral Plane.

104
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,394
Q thinks you're more likely
to say yes if I ask,

105
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,267
because you and the other
me shared a thing.

106
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,828
But we both know
that we're total strangers.

107
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,464
So...
Go on.

108
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,610
Well... See, this is
a chance to unfuck magic.

109
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,108
And as a new citizen
of Timeline 40,

110
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,015
that should be something
you would want to do.

111
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,450
Whoever asks.

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,688
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

113
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,022
It was built by the gods, but its
contents are secret by design.

114
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,097
All we mortals know is that
we are not meant to know.

115
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,031
Why wouldn't they want you
to know what's inside?

116
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,864
Perhaps it is indeed the lair
of a horrifying monster.

117
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,303
Or perhaps they simply enjoy
tormenting those of us

118
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,638
who dedicate our lives
to cataloging information.

119
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,836
Well, whatever
their motive,

120
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,970
we'd be idiots
to go in totally blind.

121
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,810
Then ask someone
who's been inside.

122
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,871
A god.

123
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,611
I believe your friends
have had encounters with them.

124
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,211
Now, there is
another matter.

125
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,131
ALICE: That's the Siphon?

126
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,461
We thought it'd be bigger.

127
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,699
It needs to be powered, and
it requires a lot of energy.

128
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,072
Our intended source has not
fulfilled their end of our bargain.

129
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,476
Well, how am I
supposed to use it?

130
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,015
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

131
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,415
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

132
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,487
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,918
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

134
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,260
That could kill her.

135
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,729
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

136
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,834
We need the Siphon
charged before...

137
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,930
I know.

138
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,536
Hmm.

139
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,611
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

140
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,115
I'll be in touch.

141
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,880
Remember.

142
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,857
Once magic is flowing again, you have
30 seconds to attach the Siphon.

143
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,757
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

144
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,574
JOSH: I come bearing gifts.

145
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,409
This is, like,
80% taco supplies.

146
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,279
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

147
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,784
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

148
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,253
No, no. If I have to catch,
pluck, or boil

149
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,451
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

150
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,259
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought I would be.

151
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,597
(SIGHS)

152
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,234
Listen, Fen.

153
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,068
Before you were born, you were
promised to a stranger.

154
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,163
A king.

155
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,509
And I'm not one anymore.

156
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,136
You don't have
to stay for my sake.

157
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,951
I'm guessing you've never thought about
where I would be if you never showed up.

158
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,180
I have.

159
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,924
Still in that same village
where I was born,

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,951
married to one of the three
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

161
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,294
Now those boys want to
drop you off a waterfall,

162
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,334
and that's them being polite.

163
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,296
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

164
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,297
That got less touching
as you went.

165
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,810
I can't go back
to my old life.

166
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,807
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

167
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,815
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

168
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,150
for the last key, but this
is what we got back.

169
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,211
Eat my ass!
We're not sure if...

170
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,550
BUNNY: Eat my ass!

171
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,147
We're not sure if...
Eat. My. Ass!

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,320
If this was the Fairy Queen's response
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

173
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,060
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

174
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,657
BUNNY: Eat. My. Ass.

176
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,471
FRAY: These are
on the house.

177
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,871
For you saving my life.

178
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,237
We need to talk
to your Queen.

179
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,140
You must know how
to get her to come.

180
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,042
It's an emergency.
FRAY: No.

181
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,174
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

182
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,412
Glass half full. She didn't
actually go through with it.

183
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:06,355
But you must have fairy stepsisters
or someone you can talk to?

184
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,359
There were no fairy
children in the Realm.

185
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,988
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

186
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,827
Like me.

187
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,731
Being sent to you
ruined everything.

188
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,234
I can't go back
to the Fairy Realm,

189
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,530
I don't fit in with humans.

190
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,697
Why do you think
I work at an animal bar?

191
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,436
No, really, really,
I'm not judging you.

192
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,409
Trust me,
I'm not judging you.

193
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,107
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

194
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,385
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked-up childhood.

195
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,079
But what we want
to offer the Queen

196
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,919
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

197
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,460
Maybe the distance between us
can finally start to close.

198
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,254
And maybe then,
you won't feel so alone.

199
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,923
That's kind.

200
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,595
But just so you know,
I'm not alone.

201
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,696

Bye, Humbledrum.

204
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,542
I love that bear.

205
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,078
So do I.

206
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,951
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we
were kind of having a moment.

207
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:14,253
No, honey, she "loves" him.

208
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,901
Uh, so not bear boss.
Bear boyfriend?

209
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,935
Is that a thing in Fillory?

210
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,167
Apparently, very taboo.

211
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,472
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

212
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,446
if I got my way, I'd say go
hog-wild or bear-wild or bull-wild.

213
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,984
He's very concerned
about getting your approval.

214
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,577
I don't think he quite gets that
you're not even Fray's real dad.

215
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,857
Well, then...

216
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,926
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

217
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,627
I'm so happy
you're dating a bear.

218
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,937
Thanks...

219
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,271

220
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,436
HUMBLEDRUM:
Thanks, Fray's dad.

221
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,447
No problem.

ALICE: That's all
the Librarian knows.

223
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,311
We have to find someone
who's been inside the castle.

224
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,854
Son.

225
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,889
A god. You say that
like it's easy.

226
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,324
Our Lady Underground
hasn't answered me in months.

227
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,556
Yeah, the only way to track
Bacchus down was his lnstagram

228
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,997
and it looks like it got deleted
for terms of service violations.

229
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,466
Nipples, apparently.

230
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,900
Well, that's bullshit.

231
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,664
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

232
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,133
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

233
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,809
She's lying.

234
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,213
Not about the god stuff,
that's true.

235
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,683
It's what
she's leaving out.

236
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,654
They have some sort of
metal thing called a "Siphon."

237
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,181
She's supposed to charge it up
by ripping out Julia's power,

238
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,886
which could kill her.

239
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,555
She didn't seem psyched about the
idea, but she didn't say no.

240
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,759
So, now what?

241
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,581
PENNY 23: What's that?
Truth Key'?

242
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,253

to go away.

to the other Penny.

You're the "other Pennyâ€œ.

we could help him.

you did for the other me.

would have done that for me

She is not the person
you loved.

263

You don't owe me anything.

264
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,199
But for what it's worth, it'd
be helpful if you explained it.

265
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,961
How she's different

266
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,812

00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,320
What happened to him
after OLU. took him away?

268
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,822
I don't know.

269
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:10,358
But it was his spark
that Our Lady gave to Julia.

270

I know it's
not about me.

271

None of it ever
really felt about me.

could be out there?

next, to outlaw abortion?

691
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,959
The key replaced
my Penny with you.

692
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,894
Look, I'm really sorry.

693
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,230
(CLATTERS)

694
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,770
(BREATH TREMBLES)

695
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,832
JULIA: This is it.

696
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,064
The end of the story.

697
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,135
Floodgates of magic,
ready to be opened.

698
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,808
Q? What's up,
what's wrong?

699
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,849
The quest is supposed
to change us.

700
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,151
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

701
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,817
up to this point,
and I... I can't...

702
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,657
You thought that
when you got here,

703
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,858
you'd be 150% sure you were
doing the right thing.

704
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,795
Now, you're only
somewhere around 70%.

705
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,600
Because you're worried
about your dad.

706
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,039
Party trick.

707
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,506
L just feel things.

708
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,812
I heard you healed
Dean Fogg's eyes.

709
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,441
Maybe...

710
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,782
I could heal your dad?

711
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,619
Rig ht now,
he's perfectly healthy.

712
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,352
There's nothing to do.

713
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,154
If magic comes back,

714
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:17,689
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

715
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,360
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

716
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,900
It's the deal.

717
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,035
Sorry it's vague.

718
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,069
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

719
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,245
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

720
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,555
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

721
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,568
Then the quest fucked up when
it chose Quentin Goldwater.

722
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,728
Maybe.

723
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,607
It's all real.

724
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,613
The Chatwins and Fillory.

725
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,415
I've been there.

726
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,220
I... I sat on a throne
in Whitespire, and l...

727
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,791
I explored
the Flying Forest.

728
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,696
And I...
Met Ember and Umber.

729
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,859
(CHUCKLES)

730
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,598
I remember reading you
those books.

731
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,473
Curly Q...

732
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,777
If all that's out there...

733
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,413
What are you doing here?

734
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,448
I'm on a quest.

735
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,649
TED: In New Jersey?

736
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,653
I have a problem.

737
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,219
And I don't know
what to do.

738
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,386
No matter what choice I make,
somebody gets hurt.

739
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,091
Maggie's gone.

740
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,458
Isn't ii?

741
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,461
I'm not like you.
I'm not a Magician.

742
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,066
But I could feel it
when it was gone.

743
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,841
And I knew
it wasn't a coincidence

744
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,913
when I went into
remission a week later.

745
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,004
QUENTIN: You're right.

746
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,339
My friends and I
were trying to fix it.

747
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,248
And how's that been going?

748
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,485
We're getting
really close.

749
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,020
So are you here
to ask my permission?

750
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,256
To...

751
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,423
Turn it back on?

752
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,995
On this quest...

753
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,431
I've lived a whole life.

754
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,179
I grew old, and I got married.
And I had a son.

755
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,816
Who grew old.

756
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,820
And what was all that for
if it's not for this?

757
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:02,058
No, I'm not here
to ask for your permission.

758
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,337
I wanted to look you
in the eye

759
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,306
and tell you
that I'm sorry.

760
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,303
L donâ€™t know
what's going to happen.

761
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,810
But I'm going to do this.

762
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,523
What was his name?

763
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,252
Your son.

764
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,763
I named him after you.
