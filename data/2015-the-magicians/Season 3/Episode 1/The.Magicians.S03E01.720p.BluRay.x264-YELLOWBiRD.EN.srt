1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,791
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,211
Quentin...

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,458
<i>I killed a god.</i>

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,336
Gods like Ember
have parents, you idiot.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,258
<i>When we're harmless,
they ignore us.</i>

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,257
<i>But when we become malignant,
they amputate.</i>

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,139
Magic is gone.

8
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,304
What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,556
<i>The woman and child you stole.</i>

10
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,105
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,227
I had to warn you.

12
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,317
They're coming.

13
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,855
This contract initiates our services
in exchange for...

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,941
Unlimited manual
and magical labor?

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,821
You signed that insane contract?

16
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,911
Yeah, it's okay.

17
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,555
- Did you do this for me?
- Just say it.

18
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,622
<i>Cancer.</i>

19
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,198
- Call it cancer plus.
- How long till I die?

20
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,292
Two or three weeks.

21
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,377
I need your help.

22
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,105
<i>If Penny's in the Library,
he can be your mole.</i>

23
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,961
But to do that,
he'd have to be alive.

24
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Deal.

25
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,420
<i>As a Niffin, you made enemies.</i>

26
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,379
<i>I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.</i>

27
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,589
The Lamprey.
It knows you're weak.

28
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,265
<i>It knows you're here.</i>

29
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,018
<i>He raped me.</i>

30
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,185
Your son.

31
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,639
He turned me into a monster.

32
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,598
You're a survivor.

33
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,688
<i>Why did you bring me back?</i>

34
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,735
<i>I know what you're trying to do.</i>

35
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,525
There is no actual evidence
of magical surge.

36
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,492
The best we can do is accept that
and continue our theoretical studies.

37
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,620
We all get flashes, and we can do it again.

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,161
How?

39
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,380
I have no idea.

40
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,594
Nope. Nothing.

41
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,768
No freeze, no boil.

42
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:44,854
Shit.

43
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,019
It's okay.

44
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,597
You can still do other stuff.

45
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,557
Q, I can't do anything real.

46
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,608
It's like there's
no pattern to this,

47
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,984
nothing that we do
can make it stronger or better.

48
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,237
I'm starting to feel like
it's all random, you know?

49
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,693
Maybe it was a mistake.

50
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,073
Come on, you don't mean that.

51
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,622
What if this is, like, a smudge?

52
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,325
A fingerprint left by O.L.U.
when she gave me back my Shade,

53
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,830
and she didn't even realize?

54
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,037
You know, it's like,
whoops, speck of magic.

55
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,338
She's a goddess.

56
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,131
Does she seem like
the accident type?

57
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,924
Have you met her son?

58
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,300
Look, I don't wanna
be insensitive...

59
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,723
But you still think I somehow
have this because of Reynard.

60
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,971
I don't know why you have it.

61
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,181
I just... I don't think that
we should discount the possibility.

62
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,816
I mean, you've had...

63
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,940
More contact with gods
than most.

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,901
That's a nicer way
of putting it.

65
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,612
For the record, I'm still
leaning towards fluke.

66
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,447
So it's a fluke. There's still something
that could lead us to something.

67
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,624
We have got to keep
chipping away at it, Jules.

68
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,293
Big words coming from
a guy who's mostly

69
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,373
chain-smoking and binge-watching
<i>Six Feet Under</i> when I got here.

70
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,832
You fired me up.

71
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,418
You showed me that
there's a fight to fight.

72
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:04,053
Now I am the official sidekick to whatever
it turns out you are, okay?

73
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,976
So, get used to it.

74
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,271
Wake up, asshole.

75
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,310
Ah.

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,651
What, were you a boy scout?

77
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,861
These are great.

78
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,288
Not a good time
to go with smart-ass.

79
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,664
I'm not a killer, but times are strange
and you're the one who broke into my home.

80
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,873
Yeah, well, I'm a Librarian.

81
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,329
You're ignoring our requests.

82
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,755
That book was overdue.

83
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,458
Overdue book? Come on.

84
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,009
It's my job.

85
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,924
What's the Library's real game?

86
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,884
Books?

87
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,511
Why do you care anymore?

88
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,311
'Cause what the hell else
is there to do anymore?

89
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,561
- Man, hey, that thing...
- Is not your business.

90
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,439
It's Mayakovsky's spell, right?
Little something to brew up current?

91
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,565
It's fake.

92
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,146
It does not make magic.

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,983
It does blow up like a meth lab.

94
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,568
You met Mayakovsky?

95
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,699
I'd know his spellwork anywhere.

96
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,016
Yeah, me too,
and I'm telling you...

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,872
All of this is his fault.

98
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,201
It... By his, you mean...

99
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,083
Made a bunch of
apocalypse-proof batteries,

100
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,291
then did something to turn
it all off all over the world.

101
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:25,255
Breaks his Incorporate Bond,
screws us, he's got magic, he's free.

102
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,466
Tell you what Mayakovsky
didn't think about...

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,519
Creatures. They're fine.

104
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,643
Whatever they are, it's DNA.

105
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,940
So I hear.

106
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,820
We're fish bait now.

107
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,274
Thank God I got this place,
'cause they're coming.

108
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,483
I promise you.

109
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,873
Well, karma is a righteous bitch.

110
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,249
Karma's gonna be...
We kill them all, son.

111
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,421
If you can.

112
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,591
I mean, some of them
look just like us.

113
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,211
You'd never know
they're not quite human.

114
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,326
I like the little apron.

115
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,002
Penny.

116
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,876
What the hell are you...

117
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,798
Oh, you shouldn't be here.

118
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,524
You don't have
that kind of time to waste.

119
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,801
It's not wasted.

120
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,048
They treating you okay?

121
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,846
Everything's fine.
It's all fine.

122
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,970
Nothing is fine.

123
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,892
I'm looking at you.
There's that.

124
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,602
You look good.

125
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,103
Huh. White-knuckle sobriety
and forced celibacy's my look.

126
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,773
You need to go back.

127
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,106
I was kinda thinking we were
gonna grab a quickie in the car.

128
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:11,032
Yeah, that sounds great,
except I don't have a car, and...

129
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,989
And you're fucking dying.

130
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,994
Worth it.

131
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,837
Go.

132
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,791
I love you.

133
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,213
Go.

134
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,891
We don't have the funds to...

135
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,722
We're just going to
have to borrow.

136
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,978
Begging Pardon,
but Tick is right.

137
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,578
Excuse me, Sire.

138
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,791
Your Majesty?

139
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,258
Look, there is
no unshitty answer

140
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,091
to any of this, people,
so suck it up.

141
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,685
Oh. Oh-oh.

142
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,320
Mmm. Yeah.

143
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,111
Ahem. We need
to discuss the borders.

144
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,201
Great.

145
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,277
After lunch.

146
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,363
Thank you. Dismissed.

147
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,951
We have things to discuss, dear.

148
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,581
- Fabulous.
- Not you.

149
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,085
Your long-suffering high queen.

150
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,290
You may go.

151
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,876
Margo, stay.

152
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,466
<i>Lumbricus Campestris.</i>

153
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,595
Oh, don't tell me.

154
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,848
Feather of a left-handed crow?

155
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,601
Butterfly with PMS this time?

156
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,184
Turtle semen with
a rosemary garnish?

157
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,360
It's a type of earthworm.

158
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,065
It lives abundantly in the grounds
around the castle.

159
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,903
Collect them all.

160
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,528
Okay.

161
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,251
Really enjoying
our ongoing whimsy-fest,

162
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:28,047
but I am a tad busy trying
to keep the country from starving,

163
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,375
- so...
- Better hurry, then.

164
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,814
You were gone too long.

165
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,271
Was I?

166
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,153
Thought I was...

167
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,280
You have to move quickly out there.

168
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,056
Every time you leave this
branch, you go where

169
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,037
time moves normally
and where time progresses...

170
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,411
So does my super cancer, I know.

171
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,665
It's a pity the best y'all could do
was a place where time stopped.

172
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,088
You know, time going backward?

173
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,335
That'd be better.

174
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,225
I've been giving you assignments
that shouldn't take more than an hour.

175
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,010
- I don't want you...
- Me to die?

176
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,883
How sweet of you,
considering you poisoned me.

177
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,093
You know that wasn't me.

178
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,262
No one wants you to die.

179
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,392
I know.

180
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,566
You know, Travelers?
Hard to come by.

181
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,768
I wish you wouldn't be
so cynical.

182
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,197
Thank you. You need to rest.

183
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,735
How is it?

184
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,329
Out there?

185
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,284
Depressing.

186
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,805
Henry.

187
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,015
Is that... Is that
Irene McAllistair?

188
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,936
Well, it is good to see you.

189
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,014
Oh, and how is the...

190
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,441
The board of trustees?

191
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,270
Oh, well, out of their minds.

192
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,696
Well, I don't need to tell you
how many of their companies

193
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,114
went belly up when magic died.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,988
You do not. I have
stock in several.

195
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,614
- Join the club.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,956
And your family?

197
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,283
Well, you know them.

198
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:31,087
Stuffy, cautious...
Survive anything.

199
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,131
But the rest of the board...

200
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,840
Look, Henry, I came here
alone because I respect you.

201
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,092
Well, you taught me
everything that I know.

202
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,515
- No need to exaggerate.
- I'm not.

203
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,594
And no one needs to convince me that
this school is important.

204
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,180
I gather that's not
the case for everyone.

205
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,390
They're panicked.

206
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,683
They want magic.

207
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,609
So too do we all.

208
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,940
They believe that there's gotta be
something out there somewhere.

209
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,240
Mayakovsky.

210
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,318
He was working on a battery.

211
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,404
We searched Brakebills South...

212
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:09,333
Still, they feel that
the resources of this school

213
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,378
would be best spent
continuing to search for...

214
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,171
I cannot stop my students
from searching.

215
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,250
But we are a school.

216
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,754
We still teach here.

217
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,882
It is perhaps
more important than ever.

218
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,463
If they don't learn it,

219
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,970
I fear no one will
ever again, you understand?

220
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,300
I fear that too.

221
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,556
But if you don't
find them something...

222
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,269
The board is gonna
close down Brakebills.

223
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,397
You have to give them
something, Henry.

224
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,853
Quickly.

225
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,239
So, what do you think?

226
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,704
Okay, say you were to do it.

227
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,911
Work your way through some
piddly little Earth gods,

228
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,715
find a way to talk to an actual old god,
and you say what?

229
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,632
Hi, please reconsider,
even though you are

230
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,962
a billion times smarter
than I, and... And... More powerful,

231
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,326
if you could please bring back magic,
that would be great.

232
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,994
I don't know, I just...
I figured it couldn't hurt

233
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,977
to get a little closer
and maybe meet someone

234
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,929
who knew more than we do.

235
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,230
I hear you, Q, I do.

236
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,773
- I just...
- What?

237
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,019
I wouldn't want what happened to me
to happen to anyone else.

238
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,694
Look, you don't have to come.

239
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,446
I just... I just wanted
you to know.

240
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,403
Okay, you're gonna do
a summoning alone?

241
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,535
Yeah.

242
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,618
I don't... I don't know.

243
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,459
Okay, say I was
willing to risk it.

244
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,507
I mean, it requires
serious, big magic.

245
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,821
Okay, well, cultures all over
the world have believed in these gods.

246
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,132
How did they call them?

247
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,680
Suffice to say,
not quite the party

248
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,350
I was expecting when
I came down here, but...

249
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,597
I think I could help you.

250
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,730
How can I help you?

251
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,150
Yeah.

252
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,358
I was gonna respond, and then
I remembered there's no point.

253
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,235
You can't help Penny anymore.

254
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,532
Says who?

255
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,203
What is that?

256
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,045
Ah-haha.

257
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,289
I have a job for you.

258
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,544
Earthworms.

259
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,166
Get anyone not actively...

260
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,217
Our full team is required
to keep the castle safe.

261
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,987
Okay, okay, so get like five
or six and do this for me.

262
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,172
Quick and dirty.

263
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,767
There you are.

264
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,139
Come join.

265
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,561
The southern province is

266
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,855
whatever the Fillorian word
for bankrupt is.

267
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,102
I need a drink.

268
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,691
So quick, little Queen.

269
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,314
Where are the worms?

270
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,147
Don't tell me you sent
someone out to do your work.

271
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,275
I'm a delegator.

272
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,703
It's a leadership quality.

273
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,906
You've clearly mastered it.

274
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,991
I thought I was clear.

275
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,374
They are to be plucked
by female hands.

276
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,376
And I desire those hands
to be yours.

277
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,295
But only if you wish
to keep them.

278
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,729
Shit!

279
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,431
Now this is bad.

280
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,892
I waited till I was
sure none of those

281
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,320
creepy little no-eyebrow fuckers were
around before I delegated.

282
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,194
So, how'd she know?

283
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,821
And so fast?

284
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,497
All right, so how do you know
that he'll even be here tonight?

285
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,560
I mean, there's a million
parties happening all over.

286
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,584
Easy.

287
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,910
He's on social media?

288
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,689
How else are followers
supposed to find him?

289
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,421
Met him by total accident
at Art Basel.

290
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,091
He kept that party going
eight full days.

291
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,761
Best eight days of my life.

292
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,680
Anyway, that's his thing.

293
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,305
Swing in, stoke the party,
soak in the worship, move on.

294
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,182
Inspiring, right?

295
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,854
You guys are gonna love him.

296
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,153
Josh "The Animal" Hoberman.

297
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,200
Bacchus.

298
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,703
My deity How you living?

299
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,405
So good.

300
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,417
Um, get your fine ass
in this bitch.

301
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,869
Lucy.

302
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,204
Bong hit.

303
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,884
Come back when you're fun.

304
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,226
My mistress wishes
that I tell you...

305
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,526
Uh, and you can see here

306
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,652
cracks from the swordplay of
King Boris The Softspoken.

307
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,484
That is indeed fascinating.

308
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,577
Hmm.

309
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,077
Abigail mentioned you have many
fairy guests these days.

310
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:45,502
Guests, hostile occupying force,
tomato, tomahto.

311
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:51,255
I presume you wish to extend
the most elegant level of hospitality.

312
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,676
Do I?

313
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,970
For this reason, I make you aware
of the corridor

314
00:16:55,056 --> 00:17:00,097
built by High Queen ChenLi the Bookish,
of rare stone from the Shivering Sea.

315
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,552
Okay.

316
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,727
Why?

317
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:08,730
Unfortunately, certain species
are allergic to the substance.

318
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,311
How allergic?

319
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,067
Violently, Your Majesty.

320
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,157
Good to know.

321
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,400
We advise that your guests
cannot tolerate that area

322
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,032
so if you are looking for them,

323
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,991
they will undoubtedly be
somewhere else.

324
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,453
A-plus, Rafe.

325
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,675
Huh. If Rafe says so, guess maybe
we're not the first royals

326
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,344
living a 24/7 fairy
reach-around.

327
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,715
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

328
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,454
About Queen Bitch and
all her spooky little bitches?

329
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,844
Poison sounds nice.

330
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,646
Shockingly, all books
on poison disappeared

331
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,065
from the royal library right around
the time they arrived.

332
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,440
They're armed, they're smart,
they're multitudinous,

333
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,674
they are invisible
to the guard...

334
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,189
When you put it that way.

335
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,320
What if they know
about this in Loria?

336
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,322
If I send Idri a message...

337
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,903
Worst case he comes here,

338
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,641
you look at him naked
and cheer up a little.

339
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,375
How dare you make me
sound that shallow, but, yes.

340
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,590
Hi.

341
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,290
Great to see you, as always.

342
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,920
I'll go write that letter.

343
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,172
To who?

344
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,299
Not Idri of Loria?

345
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,426
Actually, yes.

346
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,429
Our crops are dying now
that we can't schedule the rain.

347
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,351
I hope he can help.

348
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,806
His library, like yours,
has of course been purged

349
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,483
of any material pertaining to
our species.

350
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,029
And any Lorian aware
of the existence of fairies

351
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,449
has been instructed
to keep their mouth shut

352
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,027
or lose their tongue.

353
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,455
Please don't
underestimate me again.

354
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,496
It hurts my feelings.

355
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,788
We're gonna go take a walk
and have a good think

356
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,918
about our behavior.

357
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,888
Come on, we not fun yet?

358
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,223
Oh.

359
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,936
Yeah, do we not...
Do we not amuse!

360
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,483
Do we not amuse?

361
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,070
Hey.

362
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,741
I think I...
I think I got it, Q.

363
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,988
Okay.

364
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,786
Remember that time,
10th grade, right?

365
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,364
And we made up that dance
and it was terrible.

366
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,619
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

367
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:33,371
- So white and bad.
- Yeah, that might actually work.

368
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,421
It was very, like,
hip thrusty if I remember.

369
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,544
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

370
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,500
- I remember it, my friend.
- Uh...

371
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,210
<i>Ayo</i>

372
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,638
<i>I'm tired of using technology.</i>

373
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,592
<i>Uh! So why don't you
sit in front of me.</i>

374
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,468
<i>Ayo</i>

375
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,312
<i>I'm tired of using technology.</i>

376
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,608
<i>Uh! I need you right
in front of me.</i>

377
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,528
<i>Uh! She wants it Uh-uh!</i>

378
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,275
<i>She wants it.</i>

379
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,824
<i>She wants it, so I gotta
give it to her.</i>

380
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,653
<i>Ow! She wants it Uh-uh.</i>

381
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,114
<i>She wants it.</i>

382
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,495
<i>So you can fugging
give it to her.</i>

383
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,221
Hoberman!

384
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,564
Whoo!

385
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,614
So, welcome.

386
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,246
Magicians, right?

387
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,416
Yeah, how can you tell?

388
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:59,089
Your hands, and your
crazy level of drama.

389
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,217
Cheers to that.

390
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,967
Uh...

391
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,841
Going again.

392
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,140
Part <i>deux.</i>

393
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,766
I just, I w...
We would kind of really love to talk.

394
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,351
Kid, I'm Bacchus.

395
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,564
I am the god of not being
a wiggly, little anxious

396
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,071
wet dish rag that would
kind of really love to talk to you,

397
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:31,622
so I need you to unclench
your vagina and do that shot

398
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,450
or I'm moving on.

399
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,543
Just a little sexist.

400
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,963
Five, four, three, two...

401
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,999
Attaboy.

402
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,629
Okay, what do you wanna do now?

403
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,962
Twister? You wanna
pierce something?

404
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,596
Oh, I've got Trivial Pursuit
Star Trek edition.

405
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,510
Just... Mr. Bacchus, we...

406
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,597
Magic, and how
it's completely gone.

407
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,276
Magic is gone
for you little guys?

408
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,898
You don't say.

409
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,695
What is... All over the U.S.?

410
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,444
All over everywhere, we think.

411
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,823
Oh, I've been
a little out of touch.

412
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,159
Well, that sucks for you.

413
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,330
Why?

414
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,992
Well...

415
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,748
I, um...

416
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,378
Sort of killed a god.

417
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,330
A minor... Like, a very,
you know...

418
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,960
- We had to.
- A minor god.

419
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,259
Not because we wanted to,
but just because we had to.

420
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,426
- You understand...
- Who?

421
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,423
Who the fuck did you kill?

422
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,301
Um, Ember in...

423
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,229
Fillory?

424
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,438
I don't know that guy.

425
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,320
Deserved it. I...

426
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,069
Oh!

427
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,244
- Tough choices make a man, man.
- Yeah.

428
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,365
Open your mouth.

429
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,536
Sorry?

430
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,455
Like, open your mouth.

431
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,659
Ahh.

432
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,461
Happy birthday.

433
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,210
Okay, so this is gonna be

434
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,792
a little bit more challenging than
we expected.

435
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,548
What did you put in my mouth?

436
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,193
Alice? Where are you going?

437
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,030
I can't do this.
I can't study dead magic.

438
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,489
I can't...

439
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,041
Can we just go sit down
somewhere and talk, please?

440
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,993
Stop. Look, here's the deal.

441
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,953
I thought if we hung out,
maybe had sex,

442
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,256
I don't know, went to school,
it would feel like it did.

443
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,425
I thought I could
forgive you, but I can't.

444
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,921
I just...

445
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,174
Say good-bye and let me go.

446
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,677
Good-bye, Alice.

447
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,226
Alice?

448
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,810
Nope.

449
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,871
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you okay?

450
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,131
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

451
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,311
Hey.

452
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,014
Sorry.

453
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,644
- I am so...
- No, it's...

454
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,270
- Very...
- Me too.

455
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,477
Very high.

456
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,482
I get it.

457
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,951
Does your high ever turn on you
and you go from happy to

458
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,905
remembering you live in
a barren world devoid of magic?

459
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,709
Mine more goes from okay to,

460
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,708
"Oh, yeah, you have PTSD
from being sexually assaulted"

461
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,585
"by a trickster god."

462
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,126
Long story.

463
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,469
I got time.

464
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,431
Let's talk about something else.

465
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,598
Sure.

466
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,927
Sure, whatever you...

467
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,063
Hey, you ever, uh...

468
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,308
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,903
I just really loved doing magic.

470
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,988
And I was good at it.

471
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,820
You should have tasted my tomatoes.

472
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,404
And just, the air
smelled different, right?

473
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,333
And I could turn into
a bird, or make a rose bloom.

474
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,916
And I saw actual Fillory.

475
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,963
And I banged a werewolf, yes.

476
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,293
That is weird, but also rad, because
who gets to do that?

477
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,548
And I wasn't just some
extremely average nobody.

478
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,973
I was gifted.

479
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,927
I didn't just belong somewhere.

480
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,560
I belonged anywhere
because I was a Magician.

481
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,440
I just...

482
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,858
I don't even know what
anything is even about anymore.

483
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,782
Maybe there's a way
to get it back.

484
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:30,041
Look, no offense,
I've been researching, and...

485
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,837
Stick a fork in it.

486
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:05,451
Please tell me you're not just really,
really good at smoke rings.

487
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,035
Mmm-mmm.

488
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,334
No, I can't even blow one.

489
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,535
How?

490
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,123
I don't know yet.

491
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,507
Julia.

492
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,504
Q!

493
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,549
Stop, Q, you're giving
me the spins...

494
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,305
Look, I know that you're
blasted, but...

495
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,395
You're blasted!

496
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,187
Yeah, but even I know that
you cannot show people that.

497
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,481
Why not?

498
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,044
Because if the wrong people
found out...

499
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,230
He is not the wrong people.

500
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,904
I can't go through the rest of my life
just not trusting anyone.

501
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,323
I feel fucked up enough.

502
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,655
I get that.

503
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,783
Just put yourself in my shoes
just for one second, Q.

504
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,706
I have magic.

505
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,658
And what does it do?

506
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,959
More or less jack shit.

507
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:56,460
And I see someone whose entire life
would change if he could just see it.

508
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,802
I have to be able to do
something with it.

509
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,222
And if that's cheer up
Josh Hoberman, then I'll take it.

510
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,174
Because I can't... You know,

511
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,760
I can't be so precious with
something that is so small.

512
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,470
It's not small, it's the...

513
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,183
It's the biggest magic, Jules.

514
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,359
'Cause as far as we know,

515
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,029
for us little guys,
it's the only magic out there.

516
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,121
Ow! What... Ow!

517
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,935
Dude, you're gonna leave
a mark and I don't like that

518
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,370
in a non-sexual context.

519
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,044
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Um...

520
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,673
You watched <i>Battlestar</i>, right?

521
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,876
Yeah, I love when they
do terrorism allegory

522
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,210
with mostly white people.

523
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,679
Hmm. You remember
Grace Park in season one?

524
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,846
Of course, best storyline.

525
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,136
- Why?
- Duh... Because she was actually...

526
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,308
You're Grace Park.

527
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,555
Okay?

528
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,105
You're Grace Park, Margo.

529
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,314
- I'm Grace Park.
- Yeah.

530
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,781
And we have ourselves a bit of a...
Gene Hackman in <i>The Conversation.</i>

531
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,074
I didn't see that one.

532
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,492
Yeah, right... Um...

533
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,537
Someone is "xoxo,
Gossip Girl"- ing our shit.

534
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,168
Remember James Marsden
in <i>X-Men?</i> Hmm?

535
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:21,083
Your Marsden is xoxo-ing us
full on that great song by The Police.

536
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,049
That Fairuza Balk in <i>The Craft.</i>

537
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,423
Yeah, more Cersei Lannister.

538
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,593
Hey, glad I made you read those.

539
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,265
Well, I read the Wiki.

540
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,236
What? Those books are
like a million pages long.

541
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,648
- I have a life.
- Okay.

542
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:42,274
Anyway, whatever your Marsden
would xoxo, Cersei xoxo's.

543
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,107
So, we have to keep it very
best episode of <i>Buffy.</i>

544
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Oh, musical?

545
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,698
- The other one.
- Okay.

546
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,286
How do we Lizzie Borden
the shit out of this thing?

547
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:57,745
'Cause I am about ready
to go full '07 Britney.

548
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,922
Maybe we could've back when
this place was Pottered up.

549
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,125
Still.

550
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,802
Even without a wand,
Harry would figure some shit out.

551
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,098
Honestly, I didn't quite
finish those books either...

552
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,800
Our Harry, I mean.

553
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,977
Oh! Him.

554
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,148
Well, he'd...

555
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,023
Mmm-hmm?

556
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,773
Consult the creepy pedophile.

557
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,499
We're close, I think.

558
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,704
I thought this excursion was
mostly about drinking heavily.

559
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,504
I needed to imply that

560
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,709
so we could get away
without extra eyes on us.

561
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,135
Fairies, Tick.

562
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,007
When magic died, they pounced.

563
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,716
Full occupation.

564
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,053
This explains so much.

565
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,809
What will we do?

566
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,107
The White Lady was spotted
somewhere near here.

567
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,567
We're going to shoot her,

568
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,028
and then we're going to wish
those fairies to the fucking cornfield.

569
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,613
Oh, excellent.

570
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,033
Whatever a cornfield is.

571
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,216
Oh! Oh, there he is!

572
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,387
Man... Or, god, I just...

573
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,719
Look, I thank you.

574
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,726
I just... I feel...
You know, whatever you put in my mouth...

575
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,648
I just... I feel like...

576
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,353
You know, like a sugary cereal
in the good way.

577
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,405
You know? It's like, whoa!

578
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,572
All right.

579
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,158
Hey, hey, shots, right?

580
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,157
Shots, shots, shots, shots.

581
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,113
You and me. Shots, shots.

582
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,664
I love you, I love you.

583
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,037
<i>I'm falling on my knees.</i>

584
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,587
<i>In worship of you.</i>

585
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,632
Yeah.

586
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,630
Look, so, anyway, I was
thinking, while we're here,

587
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,507
maybe I could ask you
a few questions.

588
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,597
Dude.

589
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,636
You're a vibe-killer.

590
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,011
- No.
- Yes, you are.

591
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,970
And historically,
I do smite vibe-killers.

592
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,645
No, look, I'm a vibe-supporter.

593
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,474
I just also happen to be a concerned
Magician individual

594
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,528
who would like to get
a word in with your parents.

595
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,114
My parents?

596
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,690
Yeah, the old gods.

597
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:40,453
Are imperious and distant dickwads
who I haven't spoken to in a millennia.

598
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,079
Rambo!

599
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,996
Let's get that
foam gun loaded, baby.

600
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,467
Look, I know that this
really wasn't on your radar

601
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,921
until you met us, but we've lost our
most precious resource.

602
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,928
Dude, stop, okay?

603
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,055
If fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

604
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,932
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

605
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,604
that I met back
in Athens one time.

606
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,057
Rambo! Rambo!

607
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,151
What was the name of that guy
that I met in Athens,

608
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,027
that up-with-humans guy?

609
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,229
Fit bod.

610
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,359
You mean Prometheus?

611
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,530
Prom...

612
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,281
That guy loved Magicians,
and he would want to help you.

613
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,370
He's dead.

614
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,571
What?

615
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,207
Prometheus died, like,
1,500 years ago, man.

616
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,829
Sorry.

617
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,502
Damn it.

618
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,460
Well, he lived
a pretty tortured existence,

619
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,590
so, dying was
probably a relief for him.

620
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:35,799
Ahem.

621
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,222
But, still,
he would've helped you.

622
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,846
He told me this crazy story one time
about how there's like...

623
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,058
Like, a secret back door
to magic.

624
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,559
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

625
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,739
I don't remember the deets,
okay, my face was melting off.

626
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,817
Secret back door.

627
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,652
Just, something...

628
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,862
Mmm-hmm.

629
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,533
Wait!

630
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,495
Might've been a brothel.

631
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,952
Shots.

632
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,086
Tick?

633
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,423
Tick?

634
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,804
Shit.

635
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,030
Not the best idea, Eliot.

636
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,370
I was looking for
the White Lady.

637
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,621
Is this she?

638
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,297
Look, if you don't come out of there,
I'm going to have to shoot you.

639
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,134
Gods! Have you never
given a compliment?

640
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,971
For example, my, my,
High King Eliot.

641
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:12,058
Your long legs look
so well in those breeches.

642
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,940
Thank you.

643
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,480
Your turn.

644
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,569
You sound like a...

645
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,862
Very attractive Creature.

646
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,246
You think so?

647
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:31,419
I've met many non-humans,
and your voice is by far the...

648
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,838
Sexiest.

649
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,958
Really?

650
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,381
I mean, you sound noble.

651
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,334
I didn't mean...

652
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:44,299
You're wise, for I am, indeed,
the sexiest in the land.

653
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,727
It is I, the Great Cock
of The Darkling Woods.

654
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,020
The Great...

655
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,066
Cock.

656
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,479
Have you never
beheld one, child of Earth?

657
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,901
No, no.

658
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,979
No, I've beheld one or two.

659
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,694
But you are, by far,
the most majestic.

660
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,197
I'm diligent about hydration.

661
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,905
All right, petitioner,
let's chat.

662
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,645
I like your style.

663
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:39,524
What is the point of hearing a petition
if the aesthetics are shit?

664
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,446
I need help with a fairy thing.

665
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:51,241
Tribal matriarchies
are the absolute worst.

666
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:58,298
So, I was just hoping in your great,
benevolent handsomeness

667
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,546
that you would see fit
to grant me just one little wish.

668
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,754
That's the sort of thing my sister,
The Winter's Doe, specializes in.

669
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,716
Also, when was the last time
a petitioner didn't get

670
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,643
utterly assfucked by
a wish-granting?

671
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,845
Yeah.

672
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,563
And yet...

673
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,106
I'll do you better.

674
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,605
There's a problem
far greater than fairies.

675
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,982
Solve it, they're nothing.

676
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,863
I'll send you on an epic quest.

677
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,617
That's...

678
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,113
Uh...

679
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,619
Wow, that's great. Thank you.

680
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:33,790
It's just...

681
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,960
My people need help.

682
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,958
- They sure do.
- Today.

683
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,131
The Fairy Queen is sitting
on my throne as we speak.

684
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,083
Do you want your magic
back or not?

685
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,919
Will it not solve
all your problems?

686
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,848
I mean, yes, but, it's just...

687
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,175
How long does a quest
like this take?

688
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,181
A good season.

689
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,387
Right.

690
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,643
My kingdom is in trouble now.

691
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,188
You are a good king.

692
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:05,323
But it is time to become
a great one.

693
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,651
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

694
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:15,117
where you are no king,
no Magician, just a vulnerable man.

695
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,830
Honestly, that sounds like
something I might really fuck up.

696
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,837
Yes, or it wouldn't be a quest.

697
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,507
You have friends, don't you?

698
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,969
I used to.

699
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,522
The one-eyed conqueror,
the traveler, the warrior,

700
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:41,351
the fool, the god-touched,
the lover of tomatoes,

701
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,436
and the torture artist...

702
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,941
Wait, which one is that?

703
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,772
- You lost me there.
- Nevermind.

704
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,780
You have a brother
of the heart with the foppy hair.

705
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,870
That would be Quentin.

706
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,617
You're parts of one whole.

707
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,289
No one can do this alone.

708
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,867
Okay.

709
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,874
FYI, I can't contact them
or reach them in any way.

710
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:04,048
You must find
the book with no author.

711
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,716
A tale for children,
but they're hardly that.

712
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:11,138
There is the key... Or, the keys...
In a place called...

713
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,762
Public Library.

714
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:20,307
In the shire of Chester
in the land of New Jersey.

715
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,062
Again, that sure
sounds like Earth.

716
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:26,816
Eliot, the quest I bestow on you is
the task you were born for.

717
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,317
Claim it.

718
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,747
Abigail,
talking-animal question.

719
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,454
So, bunnies.

720
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,004
Her Sluggishness
has noted that you are aware

721
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,427
of their messenger abilities.

722
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,425
So, that is what
the Fairy Queen uses them for?

723
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,553
Bunnies move easily
between worlds.

724
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,594
And do they serve her?

725
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,930
And if so, how loyally?

726
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,266
Every bunny for itself, Majesty.

727
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,935
Thank you.

728
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,329
Need help.

729
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,955
Love, Eliot.

730
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,555
Q.

731
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,515
I think this is it.

732
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,025
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

733
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,320
No author, I mean,
I can feel something coming off of it.

734
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,078
Interesting.

735
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,180
Interesting.

736
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:21,727
Yeah, if by interesting,
you mean, blank, sure.

737
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,725
Quests never give away the farm.

738
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,307
You've gotta earn everything.

739
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,023
Jules, this is our quest.

740
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,775
And we're already on it.

741
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,113
- Epic quest.
- We have to.

742
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,472
- Map from the book.
- Work together.

743
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,703
- Also I think...
- Eliot.

744
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,325
- Epic Quest.
- The Great Cock.

745
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,624
- It's called After Island.
- A back door to...

746
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,910
- The Great Cock.
- Epic quest.

747
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,202
- Keys.
- Here's the deal.

748
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,287
- Epic quest.
- All seven keys.

749
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,294
- Here's the deal.
- Epic quest.

750
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,252
Just shush for
one second, please.

751
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,224
Uh, that one.

752
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,517
Put him first.

753
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,523
Your father and I
are so proud of you.

754
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,691
Okay...

755
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,316
We are go for epic quest.

756
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,902
You are indeed a brave king.

757
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,990
I am indeed a guy with not much choice,
but thanks for rounding up.

758
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,334
We're looking for keys.

759
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,879
Q and Julia believe
whatever the keys unlock,

760
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,957
will help restore magic.

761
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,260
And they think
the first key is here in Fillory.

762
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,923
Excellent.

763
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,381
Some place called After Island?

764
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,716
Oh.

765
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:46,137
It lies beyond
our border, Majesty.

766
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,019
You would be venturing
to strange lands not your own.

767
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,192
So, not the friendliest?

768
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:57,239
It is said that even the Outer Sea itself
wishes ill upon our king.

769
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,861
Some have sailed before you...

770
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,408
And how'd that go?

771
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,656
They drowned.

772
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,199
Oh.

773
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,074
Well, how do we prevent that?

774
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,659
I wish I knew, I only...

775
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,994
I know.

776
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,463
I know exactly
the boat you need.

777
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,019
Okay! That's enough.

778
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,645
Let's talk.

779
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,816
So transactional.

780
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,982
What do you want
with a Lamprey anyway?

781
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,238
It's more what
the Lamprey wants with me.

782
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,785
Oh, shit.

783
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,658
You poked the wrong bear,
sweetness.

784
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,580
Just tell me what you know.

785
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,540
Please?

786
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,687
Well, if you could do magic...

787
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,168
Yeah, well, I can't.

788
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,420
So...

789
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,875
So, you're down
to an early warning device.

790
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,460
An alarm, if you will.

791
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:03,764
So, just maybe,
you still got time to run.

792
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,341
Okay, fine, I'll take it.

793
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,399
What, is that a joke?

794
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,226
I gave up jokes 80 years ago.

795
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,482
Tired of being misunderstood.

796
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,825
So get one, and keep it
on your person at all times.

797
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,528
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

798
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,623
Ah.

799
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,937
Just a side of bacon, please.
