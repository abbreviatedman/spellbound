far greater than fairies.

Do you want your magic
back or not?

Will it not solve
all your problems?

725
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,875
I mean, yes, but,
it's just--

726
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,209
How long does a quest
like this take?

727
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,215
A good season.

728
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,409
Right.

My kingdom is
in trouble now.

730
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,216
You are a good king.

731
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:05,325
But it is time to become
a great one.

732
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,659
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

733
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:15,136
where you are no king, no
Magician, just a vulnerable man.

734
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,835
Honestly, that sounds like
something I might really fuck up.

735
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,845
Yes, or it wouldn't
be a quest.

736
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,512

don't you?

and the torture artist--

741
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,966
Wait, which one is that?

742
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,798
You lost me there.
Nevermind.

743
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,806
You have a brother of the
heart with the foppy hair.

744
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:51,863
That would be Quentin.

between worlds.

764

And do they serve her?

765

And if so, how loyally?
