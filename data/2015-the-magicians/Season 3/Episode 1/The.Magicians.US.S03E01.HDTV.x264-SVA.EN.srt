1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,789
<i>Previously, on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,757
Quentin...

3
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,537
<i>I killed a god.</i>

4
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:08,148
Gods like Ember have parents, you idiot.

5
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:09,820
<i>When we're harmless, they ignore us.</i>

6
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:12,233
<i>But when we become malignant,
they amputate.</i>

7
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:15,344
Magic is gone.

8
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:18,241
What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

9
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:20,766
<i>The woman and child you stole.</i>

10
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:22,991
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

11
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:25,151
I had to warn you. They're coming.

12
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:30,588
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

13
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,658
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

14
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:35,560
- You signed that insane contract?
- Yeah, it's okay.

15
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:37,664
- Did you do this for me?
- Just say it.

16
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:38,740
Cancer.

17
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:41,066
- Call it Cancer plus.
- How long till I die?

18
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,133
Two or three weeks.

19
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,322
I need your help.

20
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,392
<i>If Penny's in the library,
he can be your mole.</i>

21
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,915
But to do that, he'd have to be alive.

22
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,908
Deal.

23
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:51,210
<i>As a niffin, you made enemies.</i>

24
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:54,180
<i>I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.</i>

25
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,549
The Lambre. It knows you're weak.

26
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,082
<i>It knows you're here.</i>

27
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,219
<i>He raped me.</i>

28
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,416
Your son.

29
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,777
He turned me into a monster.

30
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:07,457
You're a survivor.

31
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>Why did you bring me back?</i>

32
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:10,962
<i>I know what you're trying to do.</i>

33
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:15,835
There is no actual evidence
of magical surge.

34
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,665
The best we can do is accept that

35
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:20,670
and continue our theoretical studies.

36
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:22,072
We all get flashes,

37
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:23,340
and we can do it again.

38
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:27,411
How?

39
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:30,476
I have no idea.

40
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,590
Nope. Nothing.

41
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,726
No freeze, no boil.

42
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,761
Shit.

43
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:44,929
It's okay.

44
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,597
You can still do other stuff.

45
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:48,573
Q, I can't do anything real.

46
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,600
It's like there's no pattern to this,

47
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:54,233
nothing that we do can
make it stronger or better.

48
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:57,108
I'm starting to feel like
it's all random, you know?

49
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,675
Maybe it was a mistake.

50
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,978
Come on, you don't mean that.

51
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,614
What if this is, like, a smudge?

52
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,376
A fingerprint left by OLU when
she gave me back my Shade,

53
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,785
and she didn't even realize?

54
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,953
You know, it's like,
whoops, speck of magic.

55
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,388
She's a goddess.

56
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,023
Does she seem like the accident type?

57
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,858
Have you met her son?

58
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:18,339
Look, I don't wanna be insensitive...

59
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:21,868
But you still think I somehow
have this because of Reynard.

60
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:24,071
I don't know why you have it.

61
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,672
I just... I-I don't think

62
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:28,809
that we should discount the possibility.

63
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:30,945
I mean, you've had...

64
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:34,881
More contact with gods than most.

65
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:36,350
That's a nicer way of putting it.

66
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,787
For the record, I'm still
leaning towards fluke.

67
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,690
So it's a fluke. There's still something

68
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,658
that could lead us to something.

69
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,795
We have got to keep
chipping away at it, Jules.

70
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,331
Big words coming from a guy who's mostly

71
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:51,831
chain-smoking and binge-watching

72
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,365
"Six Feet Under" when I got here.

73
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,725
You fired me up.

74
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,637
You showed me that
there's a fight to fight.

75
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,774
Now I am the official sidekick

76
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,143
to whatever it turns out you are, okay?

77
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:06,245
So, get used to it.

78
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:09,336
Wake up, asshole.

79
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,831
What, were you a boy scout?
These are great.

80
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,333
Not a good time to go with smart-ass.

81
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:28,802
I'm not a killer, but times are strange

82
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,671
and you're the one
who broke into my home.

83
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,838
Yeah, well, I'm a librarian.

84
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:33,207
You're ignoring our requests.

85
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,742
That book was overdue.

86
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,176
Overdue book? Come on.

87
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,364
It's my job.

88
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,059
What's the Library's real game?

89
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:43,850
Books?

90
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:45,351
Why do you care anymore?

91
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:49,189
'Cause what the hell else
is there to do anymore?

92
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,925
Man, hey, that thing...

93
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:54,895
- Is not your business.
- It's Mayakovsky's spell, right?

94
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,304
Little something the brew up current?

95
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:57,397
It's fake.

96
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,065
It does not make magic.

97
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,935
It does blow up like a meth lab.

98
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,405
You met Mayakovsky?

99
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:06,707
I'd know his spellwork anywhere.

100
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:07,916
Yeah, me too, and I'm telling you...

101
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,842
All of this is his fault.

102
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,112
It... by his, you mean...

103
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:15,014
Made a bunch
of apocalypse-proof batteries,

104
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,184
then did something to turn
it all off all over the world.

105
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,187
Breaks his Incorporate Bond,

106
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,158
screws us, he's got magic, he's free.

107
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,178
Tell you what Mayakovsky
didn't think about...

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,225
Creatures. They're fine.

109
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,466
Whatever they are, it's DNA.

110
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,935
So I hear.

111
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,807
We're fish bait now.

112
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,775
Thank God I got this place,

113
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,177
'cause they're coming.

114
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,344
I promise you.

115
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:54,053
Well, karma is a righteous bitch.

116
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,254
Karma's gonna be...

117
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:57,018
we kill them all, son.

118
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,399
If you can.

119
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,558
I mean, some of them look just like us.

120
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:04,274
You'd never know
they're not quite human.

121
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:24,120

122
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,396
I like the little apron.

123
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,131
Penny.

124
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,033
Penny.

125
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,969
You shouldn't be here.

126
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,545
You don't have that kind
of time to waste.

127
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,971
It's not wasted.

128
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,172
They treating you okay?

129
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:49,009
Everything's fine. It's all fine.

130
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,111
Nothing is fine.

131
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm looking at you. There's that.

132
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:54,982
You look good.

133
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,149
White-knuckle sobriety

134
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,184
and forced celibacy's my look.

135
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,954
You need to go back.

136
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,165
I-I was kinda thinking we were

137
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,958
gonna grab a quickie in the car.

138
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,561
Yeah, that sounds great,

139
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:10,163
except I don't have a car, and...

140
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:13,559
and you're fucking dying.

141
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,632
Worth it.

142
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:20,975
Go.

143
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,943
I love you.

144
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:26,280
Go.

145
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,057
We don't have the funds to...

146
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,926
We're just going to have to borrow.

147
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,227
Begging Pardon, but Tick is right.

148
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:53,606
Excuse me, Sire.

149
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,543
Your Majesty?

150
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,388
Look,

151
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,624
there is no unshitty answer
to any of this, people,

152
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,219
so suck it up.

153
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:26,405
Mmm.

154
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,439
Yeah.

155
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,243
We need to discuss the borders.

156
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,211
Great.

157
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,379
After lunch.

158
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:35,415
Thank you. Dismissed.

159
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,587
We have things to discuss, dear.

160
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,288
- Fabulous.
- Not you.

161
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,891
Your long-suffering high queen.

162
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,393
You may go.

163
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,296
Margo, stay.

164
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,577
Lumbricus Campestris.

165
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:56,670
Don't tell me.

166
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,679
Feather of a left-handed crow?

167
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:01,474
Butterfly with PMS this time?

168
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:05,394
Turtle semen with a rosemary garnish?

169
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,280
It's a type of earthworm.

170
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:11,451
It lives abundantly in the
grounds around the castle.

171
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:13,120
Collect them all.

172
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:17,356
Okay.

173
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:22,194
Really enjoying our ongoing whimsy-fest,

174
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:27,033
but I am a tad busy trying to
keep the country from starving,

175
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,391
- so...
- Better hurry, then.

176
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:48,116
You were gone too long.

177
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,796
Was I?

178
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,427
Thought I was...

179
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,228
You have to move quickly out there.

180
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,007
Every time you leave this
branch, you go where

181
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,033
time moves normally
and where time progresses...

182
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,336
So does my super cancer, I know.

183
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,379
It's a pity the best y'all
could do was a place where

184
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:06,273
time stopped.

185
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,075
You know, time going backward?

186
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,276
That'd be better.

187
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,582
I've been giving you assignments

188
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:12,041
that shouldn't take more than an hour.

189
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,868
- I don't want you...
- Me to die?

190
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,516
How sweet of you,

191
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:19,552
considering you poisoned me.

192
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,555
You know that wasn't me.

193
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:23,622
No one wants you to die.

194
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,325
I know.

195
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,461
You know, travelers? Hard to come by.

196
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:29,595
I wish you wouldn't be so cynical.

197
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,000
Thank you. You need to rest.

198
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,135
How is it?

199
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:39,896
Out there?

200
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,343
Depressing.

201
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:56,788
- Henry.
- Ah.

202
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:01,194
Is that... is that Irene McAllistair?

203
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,130
Well, it is good to see you.

204
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,200
And how is the...

205
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,536
The board of trustees?

206
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,405
Oh, well, out of their minds.

207
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:14,740
Well, I don't need to tell you
how many of their companies

208
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:16,275
went belly up when magic died.

209
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:18,906
You do not. I have stock in several.

210
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,646
- Join the club.
- Yeah.

211
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,152
And your family?

212
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:26,420
Well, you know them.

213
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:30,256
Stuffy, cautious... survive anything.

214
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,292
But the rest of the board...

215
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:37,696
Look, Henry, I came here
alone because I respect you.

216
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,100
Well, you taught me
everything that I know.

217
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,436
- No need to exaggerate.
- I'm not.

218
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:45,504
And no one needs to convince me
that this school is important.

219
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:48,174
I gather that's not the case
for everyone.

220
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,209
They're panicked.

221
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:51,578
They want magic.

222
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,513
So too do we all.

223
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,749
They believe that there's gotta be

224
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,783
something out there somewhere.

225
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,219
Mayakovsky.

226
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,288
He was working on a-a battery.

227
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,355
We searched Brakebills South...

228
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,294
Still, they feel that, uh,
the resources of this school

229
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,331
would be best spent
continuing to search for...

230
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:14,167
I cannot stop my students
from searching.

231
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,235
But we are a school.

232
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:17,637
We still teach here.

233
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:19,738
It is perhaps more important than ever.

234
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:21,408
If they don't learn it,

235
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,810
I fear no one will ever again,
you understand?

236
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:25,277
I fear that too.

237
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,480
But if you don't find them something...

238
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:32,252
The board is gonna
close down Brakebills.

239
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:35,355
You have to give them something, Henry.

240
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:36,723
Quickly.

241
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,319
So, what do you think?

242
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:49,389
Okay, say you were to do it.

243
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,588
Work your way through some
piddly little Earth gods,

244
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,799
find a way to talk to an actual Old God,

245
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:55,434
and you say what?

246
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:57,170
Hi, please reconsider,
even though you are

247
00:11:57,202 --> 00:12:00,639
a billion times smarter than I,
and... and... more powerful,

248
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,884
if you could please bring back
magic, that would be great.

249
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,619
I don't know, I just...
I figured it couldn't hurt

250
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:07,647
to get a little closer
and maybe meet someone

251
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,616
who knew more than we do.

252
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,484
- I hear you, Q, I do. I just...
- What?

253
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,487
I wouldn't want what happened to me

254
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,922
to happen to anyone else.

255
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:20,426
Look, you don't have to come.

256
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,204
I just... I just wanted you to know.

257
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:25,245
Okay, you're gonna do a summoning alone?

258
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,102
Yeah.

259
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:31,138
I don't... I don't know.

260
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:35,040
Okay, say I was willing to risk it.

261
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,077
I mean, it requires serious, big magic.

262
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,880
Okay, well, cultures all over the world

263
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,482
have believed in these gods.
How did they call them?

264
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:44,217
Suffice to say, not quite the party

265
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,537
I was expecting when
I came down here, but...

266
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:49,547
I think I could help you.

267
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,426
<i>How can I help you?</i>

268
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,129
Yeah.

269
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,802
I was gonna respond,
and then I remembered

270
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,965
there's no point.

271
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:01,868
You can't help Penny anymore.

272
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,429
Says who?

273
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,292
What is that?

274
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800

282
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,221
I have a job for you.

283
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,294
Earthworms.

284
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,825
Get anyone not actively...

285
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:00,859
Our full team is required
to keep the castle safe.

286
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,638
Okay, okay, so get like five
or six and do this for me.

287
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:03,830
Quick and dirty.

288
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:11,671
Ah, there you are.

289
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:12,972
Come join.

290
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,306
The southern province is

291
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,599
whatever the Fillorian word
for bankrupt is.

292
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:17,825
I need a drink.

293
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,452
So quick, little queen.

294
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:20,947
Where are the worms?

295
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,808
Don't tell me you sent
someone out to do your work.

296
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:27,085
I'm a delegator.

297
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:30,623
It's a leadership quality.

298
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,792
You've clearly mastered it.

299
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,860
I thought I was clear.

300
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:38,163
They are to be plucked by female hands.

301
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:41,900
And I desire those hands to be yours.

302
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,203
But only if you wish to keep them.

303
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,585
Shit!

304
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,216
Now this is bad.

305
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,787
I waited till I was sure none of those

306
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,189
creepy little no-eyebrow
fuckers were around

307
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,123
before I delegated.

308
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:07,026
So, how'd she know?

309
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,728
And so fast?

310
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:12,798
All right, so how do you know

311
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:13,998
that he'll even be here tonight?

312
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:16,269
I mean, there's a million
parties happening all over.

313
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:17,202
Easy.

314
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:18,630
He's on social media?

315
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,381
How else are followers
supposed to find him?

316
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:23,209
Met him by total accident at Art Basel.

317
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:25,945
He kept that party going
eight full days.

318
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,681
Best eight days of my life.

319
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,618
Anyway, that's his thing.

320
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:35,121
Swing in, stoke the party,
soak in the worship, move on.

321
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:37,023
Inspiring, right?

322
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,758

That is indeed fascinating.

Mm.

339
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:37,017
Abigail mentioned you have
many fairy guests these days.

340
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,623
Guests,

341
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,484
hostile occupying force,

342
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,781
tomato, tomahto.

343
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:44,331
I presume you wish to extend the most

344
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:47,499
elegant level of hospitality.

345
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:48,643
Do I?

346
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,829
For this reason, I make you aware of the

347
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,933
corridor built by
High Queen ChenLi the Bookish,

348
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,369
of rare stone from the Shivering Sea.

349
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:57,937
Okay.

350
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,071
Why?

351
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:02,007
Unfortunately, certain species

352
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,995
are allergic to the substance.

353
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,545
How allergic?

354
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:10,151
- Violently, your majesty.
- Good to know.

355
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,825
We advise that your guests
cannot tolerate that area

356
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,321
so if you are looking for them,

357
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:18,744
they will undoubtedly be

358
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:21,394
somewhere else.

359
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:23,830
A-plus, Rafe.

360
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,221
Huh.

361
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,035
If Rafe says so, guess maybe
we're not the first royals

362
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:32,571
living a 24/7 fairy reach-around.

363
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,848
So what the hell are we gonna do?

364
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,619
About Queen Bitch and all
her spooky little bitches?

365
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,179
Poison sounds nice.

366
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:43,015
Shockingly,
all books on poison disappeared

367
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,603
from the royal library right
around the time they arrived.

368
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:47,452
They're armed, they're smart,

369
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:48,854
they're multitudinous,

370
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:49,998
they are invisible to the guard...

371
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:51,457
When you put it that way.

372
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,558
What if they know about this in Loria?

373
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,561
If I send Idri a message...

374
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,041
Worst case he comes here,

375
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,965
you look at him naked
and cheer up a little.

376
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,266
How dare you make me sound that shallow,

377
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,569
but yes.

378
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:07,974
Hi.

379
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,542
Great to see you, as always.

380
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,244
I'll go write that letter.

381
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:12,444
To who?

382
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,546
Not Idri of Loria?

383
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,082
Actually, yes.

384
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:19,651
Our crops are dying now that
we can't schedule the rain.

385
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,587
I hope he can help.

386
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,157
His library, like yours,
has of course been purged

387
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,609
of any material
pertaining to our species.

388
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:32,331
And any Lorian aware
of the existence of fairies

389
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,668
has been instructed
to keep their mouth shut

390
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,336
or lose their tongue.

391
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:41,986
Please don't underestimate me again.

392
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:45,017
It hurts my feelings.

393
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:48,147
We're gonna go take
a walk and have a good think

394
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:49,973
about our behavior.

395
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,227
Come on, we not fun yet?

396
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah, do we not... do we not amuse!

397
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:09,702
Do we not amuse?

398
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:14,761
Hey.

399
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,110
I think I... I think I got it, Q.

400
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:19,312
Okay. Oof.

401
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,146
Remember that time, 10th grade, right?

402
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,615
And we made up that dance
and it was terrible.

403
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,051
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

404
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,687
So white and bad.

405
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,516
Yeah, that might actually work.

406
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,656
It was very, like,
hip thrusty if I remember.

407
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,032
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.
I remember it, my friend.

408
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,079

434
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:49,535
Magicians, right?

435
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:50,669
Yeah, how can you tell?

436
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,570
Your hands,

437
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:55,408
and your crazy level of trauma.

438
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:58,511
Cheers to that.

439
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,909
Ugh.

440
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,224
Going again.

441
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,455
Part deux.

442
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,713
I just, I w...

443
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,168
we would kind of really love to talk.

444
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:15,627
Kid, I'm Bacchus.

445
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,798
I am the god of not being
a wiggly, little anxious

446
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:21,499
wet dish rag that would

447
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,401
kind of really love to talk to you,

448
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:28,046
so I need you to unclench
your vagina and do that shot

449
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,515
or I'm moving on.

450
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:31,743
Just a little sexist.

451
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,746
Five, four,

452
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:36,195
three, two...

453
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,351
Attaboy.

454
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:40,852
Okay, what do you wanna do now?

455
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,321
Twister? You wanna pierce something?

456
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:44,856
Oh, I've got

457
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,294
Trivial Pursuit Star Trek edition.

458
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:49,761
Just... Mr. Bacchus, we...

459
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:53,546
Magic, and how it's completely gone.

460
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:57,328
Magic is gone for you little guys?

461
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:59,270
You don't say.

462
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,107
What is... all over the U.S.?

463
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,708
All over everywhere, we think.

464
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,576
I've been a little

465
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:07,326
out of touch.

466
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:09,279
Well, that sucks for you.

467
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:11,201
Why?

468
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,139
Well...

469
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,142
I, um...

470
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:16,828
Sort of killed a-a god.

471
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:18,797
A minor... like, a very, you know...

472
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:20,326
- We had to.
- A minor god.

473
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,455
Not because we wanted to,
but just because we had to.

474
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,562
- You understand...
- Who?

475
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,699
Who the fuck did you kill?

476
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,135
Um, Ember in...

477
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:32,505
Fillory?

478
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:39,837
I don't know that guy.

479
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,513
Deserved it. I...

480
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,108
Tough choices make a man, man.

481
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,857
- Yeah.
- Open your mouth.

482
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:52,725
- Sorry?
- Like, open your mouth.

483
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:57,729
Happy birthday.

484
00:22:57,763 --> 00:23:00,533
Okay, so this is gonna be

485
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:03,201
a little bit more
challenging than we expected.

486
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:04,803
What did you put in my mouth?

487
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:29,528
Alice? Where are you going?

488
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:32,405
I can't do this.
I can't study dead magic.

489
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,970
- I can't...
- Can we just...

490
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,401
go sit down somewhere and talk, please?

491
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:38,617
Stop. Look, here's the deal.

492
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:40,345
I thought if we hung out, maybe had sex,

493
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:42,574
I don't know, went to school,
it would feel like it did.

494
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:44,710
I thought I could forgive you,
but I can't.

495
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:46,312
I just...

496
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:49,095
Say good-bye and let me go.

497
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:50,916
Good-bye, Alice.

498
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:53,485
Alice?

499
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,792
Nope.

Very high.

511
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:46,639
I get it.

512
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,743
Does your high ever turn on you

513
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:53,344
and you go from happy to

514

by a trickster god.

518
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,797
Long story.

519
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,078
I got time.

520
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,732
Let's talk about something else.

521
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:15,868
Sure.

522
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,023
Sure, whatever you...

523
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:22,466
Hey, you ever, uh...

524
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:24,919
I'm sorry.

525
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,372
I just really loved doing magic.

526
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:30,450
And I was good at it.

527
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,959
You should have tasted my tomatoes.

528
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:37,553
And just, the air
smelled different, right?

529
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,958
And I could turn into a bird,
or... or... or...

530
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,216
make a rose bloom.

531
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,138
And I saw actual Fillory.

532
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:47,365
And I banged a werewolf, yes.

533
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:50,636
That is weird, but also rad,
because who gets to do that?

534
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:55,628
And I wasn't just some
extremely average nobody.

535
00:25:55,873 --> 00:25:58,284
I was gifted.

536
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,198
I didn't just belong somewhere.

537
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:03,701
I belonged anywhere
because I was a Magician.

538
00:26:08,354 --> 00:26:09,693
I just...

539
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:14,093
I don't even know what
anything is even about anymore.

540
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:22,034
Maybe there's a way to get it back.

541
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,102
Look, no offense,

542
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,212
I've been researching, and...

543
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,712

Please tell me you're not just really,

00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:01,774
really good at smoke rings.

552
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,441
Mm-mm.

553
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,677
No, I can't even blow one.

554
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,844
How?

555
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,516
I don't know yet.

556
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:14,468
Julia.

557
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:16,626

559
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,926
Stop, Q, you're giving me the spins...

560
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,660
Look, I know that you're blasted, but...

561
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,388
- You're blasted!
- Yeah, but even I know that

562
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,474
you cannot show people that.

563
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:27,701
Why not?

564
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:29,210
Because if the wrong people found out...

565
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:31,602
He is not the wrong people.

566
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,905
I can't go through the rest of my life

567
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:35,140
just not trusting anyone.

568
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:36,667
I feel fucked up enough.

569
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,372
I get that.

570
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:43,047
Just put yourself in my shoes
just for one second, Q.

571
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,983
I have magic.

572
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,951
And what does it do?

573
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,187
More or less jack shit.

574
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:50,655
And I see someone whose entire life

575
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,890
would change if he could just see it.

576
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,177
<i>♪ Summer feelings are waiting ♪</i>

577
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,062
I have to be able
to do something with it.

578
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,198
And if that's cheer up Josh Hoberman,

579
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,598
then I'll take it.

580
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:02,459
Because I can't... you know,

581
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:05,036
I can't be so precious with
something that is so small.

582
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,201
It's not small, it's the...

583
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:10,267
it's the biggest magic, Jules.

584
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,493
'Cause as far as we know,

585
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:16,247
for us little guys,
it's the only magic out there.

586
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,524
Oww! What... oww.

587
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,134
Dude, you're gonna leave
a mark and I don't like that

588
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:28,727
in a non-sexual context.

589
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,229
Okay, okay, okay, okay, um...

590
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,276
You watched "Battlestar," right?

591
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,134
Yeah, I love when they
do terrorism allegory

592
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,315
- with mostly white people.
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,972
You remember Grace Park in season one?

594
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:42,140
Of course, best storyline.

595
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:43,275
- Why?
- Duh...

596
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,542
because she was actually...

597
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,178
You're Grace Park.

598
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,578
Okay?

599
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:50,516
You're Grace Park, Margo.

600
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:55,821
I'm Grace Park.

601
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,021
Yeah.

602
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:58,623
And we have ourselves a bit of a

603
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,058
Gene Hackman in "The Conversation."

604
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:03,303
- I didn't see that one.
- Yeah, right, um...

605
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:07,499
Someone is "xoxo,
Gossip Girl"-ing our shit.

606
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,936
Remember James Marsden in X-Men, hm?

607
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:14,605
Your Marsden is xoxo-ing us

608
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,742
full on that great song by The Police.

609
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:21,337
That Fairuza Balk in "The Craft."

610
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:24,698
Yeah, more Cersei Lannister.

611
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:28,627
Hey, glad I made you read those.

612
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:30,655
Well, I read the Wiki.

613
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:32,623
What? Those books are
like a million pages long.

614
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:33,958
- I have a life.
- Okay.

615
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,192
Anyway,

616
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,295
whatever your Marsden would xoxo,

617
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:38,664
Cersei xoxo's.

618
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:40,571
So, we have to keep it very

619
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,524
- best episode of "Buffy."
- Musical?

620
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,175
The other one.

621
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,269
Okay.

622
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,205
How do we Lizzie Borden

623
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:49,674
the shit out of this thing?

624
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:54,525
'Cause I am about ready
to go full '07 Britney.

625
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:58,183
Maybe we could've back when
this place was Pottered up.

626
00:29:58,216 --> 00:29:59,351
Still.

627
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,152
Even without a wand,

628
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:03,054
Harry would figure some shit out.

629
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:07,325
Honestly, I didn't quite
finish those books either...

630
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,229
Our Harry, I mean.

631
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,924
Oh! Him.

632
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,365
Well, he'd...

633
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,268
Mm-hmm.

634
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,270
Consult the creepy pedophile.

635
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:20,898
Mmm.

636
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:32,399
We're close, I think.

637
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,968
I thought this excursion was
mostly about drinking heavily.

638
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,803
I needed to imply that

639
00:30:36,844 --> 00:30:39,981
so we could get away
without extra eyes on us.

640
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,343
Fairies, Tick.

641
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:46,413
When magic died, they pounced.

642
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:47,982
Full occupation.

643
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,289
This explains so much.

644
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:53,254
What will we do?

645
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,587
The white lady was spotted
somewhere around here.

646
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,963
We're going to shoot her,

647
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,790
and then we're going
to wish those fairies

648
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:08,518
to the fucking cornfield.

649
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,844
Oh, excellent.

650
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:13,540
Whatever a cornfield is.

651
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,715
Oh, whoa!

652
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,684
There he is!

653
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,822
Man... or, god, I just...

654
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,964
Look, I thank you.

655
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:33,591
I just... I feel...

656
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,323
you know, whatever you
put in my mouth...

657
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:37,030
I just... I feel like...

658
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,598
you know, like a sugary cereal

659
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,800
in the good way.

660
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,601
You know? It's like,

661
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,037
- whoa!
- Haha, whoa.

662
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:45,601
- All right.
- Okay.

663
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,640
Hey, hey, shots, right?

664
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,642
Shots, shots, shots, shots.

665
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,610
You and me. Shots, shots.

666
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,046

Look, so, anyway,

671
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:05,023
I was thinking, while we're here,

672
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,006
maybe I could ask you a few questions.

673
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:08,227
Dude.

674
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,029
You're a vibe-killer.

675
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,798
- No.
- Yes, you are.

676
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,616
And historically,
I do smite vibe-killers.

677
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,069
No, look, I'm a vibe-supporter.

678
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:18,905
I just also happen to be
a concerned Magician individual

679
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,239
who would like to get
a word in with your parents.

680
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,610
My parents?

681
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:27,501
Yeah, the Old Gods.

682
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:32,784
Are imperious and distant dickwads

683
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,886
who I haven't spoken to in a millennia.

684
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,156
Rambo!

685
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,782
Let's get that foam gun loaded, baby.

686
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,454
Um...

687
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:45,897
Look, I know that this
really wasn't on your radar

688
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,400
until you met us, but we've lost

689
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,631
our most precious resource.

690
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,427
Dude, stop, okay?

691
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,380
If fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

692
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,274
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

693
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,011
that I met back in Athens one time.

694
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,379
Rambo! Rambo!

695
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,415
What was the name of that guy
that I met in Athens,

696
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,349
that up-with-humans guy?

697
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:05,718
Fit bod.

698
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:06,826
You mean Prometheus?

699
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,953
Prom...

700
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,721
That guy loved Magicians,

701
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,757
and he would want to help you.

702
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,825
He's dead.

703
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,327
What?

704
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,397
Prometheus died,
like, 1,500 years ago, man.

705
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:19,706
Sorry.

706
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:20,933
Damn it.

707
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:24,904
Well, he lived
a pretty tortured existence,

708
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:29,000
so, dying was probably a relief for him.

709
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:33,346
But, still, uh, he would've helped you.

710
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:35,989
He told me this crazy story one time

711
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,217
about how there's like...

712
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,050
like, a secret back door to magic.

713
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,189
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

714
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:49,127
I don't remember the deets,
okay, my face was melting off.

715
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:52,083
Secret back door.

716
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,443
- Just, something...
- Mm-hmm.

717
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,708
Wait!

718
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,755
Might've been a brothel.

719
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,415
Shots.

720
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,949
Tick?

721
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,384
Tick?

722
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,048
Shit.

723
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:34,010
Not the best idea, Eliot.

724
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,509
Um...

725
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,848
I was looking for the White Lady.

726
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,049
Is this she?

727
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,259
Look, if you don't come out of there,

728
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,795
I'm going to have to shoot you.

729
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:56,688
Gods!

730
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:58,463
Have you never given a compliment?

731
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,765
For example,

732
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,335
my, my, High King Eliot.

733
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:06,371
Your long legs look
so well in those breeches.

734
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,616
Thank you.

735
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,244
Your turn.

736
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,937
You sound like a...

737
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,363
very attractive Creature.

738
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,552
You think so?

739
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,420
I've met many non-humans,

740
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,123
and your voice is

741
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:26,142
by far the...

742
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,559
sexiest.

743
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,861
- Really?
- I mean, you sound noble.

744
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:34,040
- I didn't mean...
- You're wise,

745
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:36,040
for I am, indeed,

746
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,724
the sexiest in the land.

747
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,138
It is I,

748
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,279
the Great Cock of The Darkling Woods.

749
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,279
The Great...

750
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,615
Cock.

751
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,948
Have you never beheld one,
child of Earth?

752
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:52,017
No, no. No, I've beheld one or two.

753
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,121
But you are, by far, the most majestic.

754
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,284
I'm diligent about hydration.

755
00:35:57,484 --> 00:36:01,275
All right, petitioner, let's chat.

756
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:28,202
I like your style.

757
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,618
What is the point of hearing a petition

758
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:32,579
if the aesthetics are shit?

759
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,227
I need help with a fairy thing.

760
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:44,376
Tribal matriarchies
are the absolute worse.

761
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,922
So, I was just hoping in

762
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,517
your great, benevolent handsomeness

763
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,621
that you would see fit to grant
me just one little wish.

764
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:56,121
That's the sort of thing my sister,

765
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:57,790
The Winter's Doe, specializes in.

766
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:00,760
Also, when was the last time
a petitioner didn't get

767
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:04,022
utterly assfucked by a wish-granting?

768
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,119
Yeah.

769
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:07,524
And yet...

770
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,269
I'll do you better.

771
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:11,671
There's a problem
far greater than fairies.

772
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:14,173
Solve it, they're nothing.

773
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:19,339
I'll send you on an epic quest.

774
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:21,558
That's...

775
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,102
Ahh.

776
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:25,614
Wow, that's great. Thank you.

777
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:28,821
It's just...

778
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:30,155
My people need help.

779
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:32,007
- They sure do.
- Today.

780
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,269
The Fairy Queen is sitting
on my throne as we speak.

781
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,268
Do you want your magic back or not?

782
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:38,130
Will it not solve all your problems?

783
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,155
I mean, yes, but,

784
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:41,643
it's just...

785
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:44,120
how long does a quest like this take?

786
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,339
A good season.

787
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:47,507
Right.

788
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,956
My kingdom is in trouble now.

789
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:53,329
You are a good king.

790
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:55,454
But it is time

791
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:58,251
to become a great one.

792
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,721
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

793
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:04,997
where you are no king, no Magician,

794
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:09,044
just a vulnerable man.

795
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,223
Honestly,

796
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,867
that sounds like something
I might really fuck up.

797
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:17,250
Yes, or it wouldn't be a quest.

798
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,758
You have friends, don't you?

799
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,032
I used to.

800
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:27,361
The one-eyed conqueror,

801
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:30,493
the traveler, the warrior,

802
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,040
the fool, the god-touched,

803
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:34,494
the lover of tomatoes,

804
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,555
and the torture artist...

805
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,158
Wait, which one is that?

806
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,817
- You lost me there.
- Nevermind.

807
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,928
You have a brother of the heart

808
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,830
with the foppy hair.

809
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:46,514
- That would be Quentin.
- You're parts of one whole.

810
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:49,185
No one can do this alone.

811
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:50,778
Okay.

812
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,851
FYI, I can't contact them
or reach them in any way.

813
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:57,242
You must find the book with no author.

814
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,657
A tale for children,
but they're hardly that.

815
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:02,086
There is the key... or, the keys...

816
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,907
in a place called...

817
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,129
Public Library.

818
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:09,538
In the shire of Chester

819
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:13,459
in the land of New Jersey.

820
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,260
Again, that sure sounds like Earth.

821
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:17,797
Eliot, the quest I bestow on you

822
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,866
is the task you were born for.

823
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,434
Claim it.

824
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:32,745
Abigail,

825
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:33,812
talking-animal question.

826
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:36,582
So, bunnies.

827
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:41,221
Her Sluggishness has noted
that you are aware

828
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,367
of their messenger abilities.

829
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,558
So, that is what the
Fairy Queen uses them for?

830
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,930
Bunnies move easily between worlds.

831
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:51,541
And do they serve her?

832
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,966
And if so, how loyally?

833
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,435
Every bunny for itself, Majesty.

834
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:59,234
Thank you.

835
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:14,564
Need help.

836
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,318
Love, Eliot.

837
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,946
Q.

838
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:37,335
I think this is it.

839
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,901
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

840
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:42,124
No author, I mean, I can feel
something coming off of it.

841
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:50,734
Interesting.

842
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,146
Interesting.

843
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:13,568
Yeah, if by interesting,
you mean, blank, sure.

844
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,691
Quests never give away the farm.

845
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,160
You've gotta earn everything.

846
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:21,697
Jules, this is our quest.

847
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,864
And we're already on it.

848
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:28,699
- Epic Quest.
- We have to.

849
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:29,715
- Map from the book.
- Work together.

850
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,379
- Also I think...
- Eliot.

851
00:41:31,404 --> 00:41:33,182
- Epic Quest.
- The Great Cock.

852
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,611
- It's called After Island.
- A back door to...

853
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:36,821
- The Great Cock.
- Epic quest.

854
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:38,079
- Keys.
- Here's the deal.

855
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:40,149
- Epic quest.
- All seven keys.

856
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:43,151
- Here's the deal.
- Epic quest.

857
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:46,126
Just shush for one second, please.

858
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,090
Oh.

859
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,975
Uh, that one.

860
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:54,530
Put him first.

861
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:59,534
Your father and I are so proud of you.

862
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,022
Okay...

863
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,678
We are go for epic quest.

864
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,717
You are indeed a brave king.

865
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:14,584
I am indeed a guy with not much choice,

866
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:17,225
but thanks for rounding up.

867
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,187
We're looking for keys.

868
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:22,824
Q and Julia believe
whatever the keys unlock,

869
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:24,707
will help restore magic.

870
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:28,371
And they think the first key
is here in Fillory.

871
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:29,865
Excellent.

872
00:42:29,898 --> 00:42:32,152
Some place called After Island?

873
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:33,711
Oh.

874
00:42:33,941 --> 00:42:38,040
It lies beyond our border, Majesty.

875
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:41,952
You would be venturing
to strange lands not your own.

876
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,071
So, not the friendliest?

877
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:46,682
It is said that even
the Outer Sea itself

878
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:49,117
wishes ill upon our king.

879
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:50,827
Some have sailed before you...

880
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:52,255
Oh, and how'd that go?

881
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,655
They drowned.

882
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:55,331
Oh.

883
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:58,994
Well, how do we prevent that?

884
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,663
I wish I knew, I only...

885
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:02,612
I know.

886
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:06,068
I know exactly the boat you need.

887
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,951
Ugh, okay! That's enough.

888
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:25,568
Let's talk.

889
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,040
So transactional.

890
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,927
What do you want with a Lamprey anyway?

891
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:34,130
It's more what
the Lamprey wants with me.

892
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:35,764
Oh, shit.

893
00:43:35,798 --> 00:43:37,667
You poked the wrong bear, sweetness.

894
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,656
Just tell me what you know.

895
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,452
Please?

896
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:42,647
Well, if you could do magic...

897
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:44,547
Yeah, well, I can't.

898
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:46,500
So...

899
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:49,927
So, you're down
to an early warning device.

900
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:51,314
An alarm, if you will.

901
00:43:51,444 --> 00:43:53,428
So, just maybe,

902
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:56,217
you still got time to run.

903
00:43:56,285 --> 00:43:58,288
Okay, fine, I'll take it.

904
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,536
What, is that a joke?

905
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:08,349
I gave up jokes 80 years ago.

906
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,218
Tired of being misunderstood.

907
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:12,975
So get one,

908
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:16,218
and keep it on your person at all times.

909
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:18,974
Buena suerte.

910
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:43,342
Just a side of bacon, please.

911
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:39,234
