00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,236
You have to move quickly
out there. (COUGHS)

181
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,015
Every time you leave
this branch, you go where

182
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,008
time moves normally and
where time progresses...

183
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,373
So does my super cancer, I know.

184
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,607
It's a pity the best y'all could do
was a place where time stopped.

185
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,046
You know, time going
backward? (PANTING)

186
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,276
That'd be better.

187
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,183
I've been giving you assignments
that shouldn't take more than an hour.

188
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,983
I don't want you... Me to die?

189
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,858
How sweet of you,
considering you poisoned me.

190
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,051
You know that
wasn't me. (COUGHS)

191
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,220
No one wants you to die.

192
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,357
I know.

193
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,527
You know, Travelers?
Hard to come by.

194
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,729
I wish you wouldn't
be so cynical.

195
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,172
Thank you. You need to rest.

196
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,472

197
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,704
How is it?

198
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,279
Out there?

199
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,246
Depressing.

200

Irene McAllistair?

204
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,902
Well, it is good to see you.

206
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,973
Oh, and how is the...

207
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,407
The board of trustees?

208
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,242
Oh, well, out of their
minds. (LAUGHS)

209
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,646
Well, I don't need to tell you
how many of their companies

210
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,080
went belly up when magic died.

211
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,949
You do not. I have
stock in several.

212
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,578
Join the club. Yeah.

213
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,917
And your family?

214
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,255
Well, you know them.

215
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,059
Stuffy, cautious...
Survive anything.

216
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,101
But the rest of the board...

217
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,805
Look, Henry, I came here
alone because I respect you.

218
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,067
Well, you taught me
everything that I know.

219
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,474
No need to exaggerate. I'm not.

220
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,536
And no one needs to convince
me that this school is important.

221
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,138
I gather that's not
the case for everyone.

222
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,342
They're panicked.

223
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,650
They want magic.

224
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,551
So too do we all.

225
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,921
They believe that there's gotta be
something out there somewhere.

226
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,187
Mayakovsky.

227
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,285
He was working on a battery.

228
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,354
We searched Brakebills South...

229
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:09,300
Still, they feel that the
resources of this school

230
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,339
would be best spent
continuing to search for...

231
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,135
I cannot stop my
students from searching.

232
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,200
But we are a school.

233
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,710
We still teach here.

234
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,837
It is perhaps more
important than ever.

235
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,439
If they don't learn it,

236
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,916
I fear no one will ever
again, you understand?

237
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,281
I fear that too.

238
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,514
But if you don't find
them something...

239
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,217
The board is gonna
close down Brakebills.

240
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,353
You have to give
them something, Henry.

241
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,828
Quickly.

242
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,204
So, what do you think?

243
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,674
Okay, say you were to do it.

244
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,872
Work your way through
some piddly little Earth gods,

245
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,679
find a way to talk to an actual
old god, and you say what?

246
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,582
Hi, please reconsider,
even though you are

247
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,918
a billion times smarter than
I, and... And... More powerful,

248
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,301
if you could please bring
back magic, that would be great.

249
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,936
I don't know, I just... I
figured it couldn't hurt

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,930
to get a little closer and
maybe meet someone

251
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,895
who knew more than we do.

252
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,194
I hear you, Q, I do.

253
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,734
I just... What?

254
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,966
I wouldn't want what happened
to me to happen to anyone else.

255
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,641
Look, you don't have to come.

256
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,404
I just... I just
wanted you to know.

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,378

do a summoning alone?

I don't... I don't know.

260

Okay, say I was
willing to risk it.

261
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,459
I mean, it requires
serious, big magic.

262
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,771
Okay, well, cultures all over the
world have believed in these gods.

263
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,094
How did they call them?

say, not quite the party

265
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,295

came down here, but...

266
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,564
I think I could help you.

Yeah.

00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,314
I was gonna respond, and then
I remembered there's no point.

were around before I delegated.

00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,568
There's a problem
far greater than fairies.

714
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,935
Solve it, they're nothing.

715
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,807
I'll send you on an epic quest.

716
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,570
That's...

717
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,076
Uh...

718
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,582
Wow, that's great. Thank you.

719
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,743
It's just...

720
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,647
(SIGHS)

721
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,913
My people need help.

722
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,923
They sure do. Today.

723
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,084
The Fairy Queen is sitting
on my throne as we speak.

724
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,058
Do you want your
magic back or not?

725
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,892
Will it not solve
all your problems?

726
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:48,798
I mean, yes, but, it's just...

727
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,131
How long does a
quest like this take?

728
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,137
A good season.

729
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,365
Right.

730
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,601
My kingdom is in trouble now.

731
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,138
You are a good king.

732
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:05,281
But it is time to
become a great one.

733
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,615
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

734
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:15,092
where you are no king, no
Magician, just a vulnerable man.

735
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:20,792
Honestly, that sounds like
something I might really fuck up.

736
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,801
Yes, or it wouldn't be a quest.

737
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,468
You have friends, don't you?

738
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,940
I used to.

739
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,472
The one-eyed conqueror,
the traveler, the warrior,

740
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,314
the fool, the god-touched,
the lover of tomatoes,

741
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,411
and the torture artist...

742
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,888
Wait, which one is that?

743
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,719
You lost me there. Nevermind.

744
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,762
You have a brother of the
heart with the foppy hair.

745
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,829
That would be Quentin.

746
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,592
You're parts of one whole.

747
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,225
No one can do this alone.

748
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,825
Okay.

749
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,838
FYI, I can't contact them
or reach them in any way.

750
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,000
You must find the
book with no author.

751
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,670
A tale for children,
but they're hardly that.

752
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:11,079
There is the key... Or, the
keys... In a place called...

753
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,712
Public Library.

754
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:20,251
In the shire of Chester
in the land of New Jersey.

755
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,020
Again, that sure
sounds like Earth.

756
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:26,793
Eliot, the quest I bestow on
you is the task you were born for.

757
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,265
Claim it.

758
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,705
(CLEARS THROAT) Abigail,
talking-animal question.

759
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,407
So, bunnies.

760

(SQUEAKS)

761
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,942
Her Sluggishness has
noted that you are aware

762
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,385
of their messenger abilities.

763
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,389
So, that is what the Fairy
Queen uses them for?

764
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,517
Bunnies move easily
between worlds.

765
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,555
And do they serve her?

766
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,894
And if so, how loyally?

767
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,230
Every bunny for itself, Majesty.

768
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,898
Thank you.

769
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,282
Need help.

770
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:22,911
Love, Eliot.

771
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,535
Q.

772
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,465
I think this is it.

773
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,969
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

774
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,276
No author, I mean, I can
feel something coming off of it.

775
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,019
Interesting.

776
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,132
Interesting.

777
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:21,669
Yeah, if by interesting,
you mean, blank, sure.

778
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,680
Quests never give away the farm.

779
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,273
You've gotta earn everything.

780
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,981
Jules, this is our quest.

781
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,750
And we're already on it.

782
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,086
BUNNIES: Epic quest. We have to.

783
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,439
Map from the
book. Work together.

784
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,658
Also I think... Eliot.

785
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,289
Epic Quest. The Great Cock.

786
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,562
It's called After
Island. A back door to...

787
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,829
The Great Cock. Epic quest.

788

Keys. Here's the deal.

789
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,229
Epic quest. All seven keys.

790

Here's the deal. Epic quest.

second, please.

792
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,185
Uh, that one.

793
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,481
Put him first.

794

I are so proud of you.

795
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,663
Okay... (CLEARS THROAT)

I am indeed a guy with not much
choice, but thanks for rounding up.

00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,277
We're looking for keys.

800
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,837
Q and Julia believe
whatever the keys unlock,

801
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,907
will help restore magic.

802
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:36,215
And they think the first
key is here in Fillory.

803
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,885
Excellent.

804
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,356

805
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,688
Oh.

806
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:46,089
It lies beyond our
border, Majesty.

807
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,998
You would be venturing to
strange lands not your own.

808
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,162
So, not the friendliest?

809
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:57,197
It is said that even the Outer
Sea itself wishes ill upon our king.

811
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,378
And how'd that go?

812
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,606
They drowned.

813
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,177
Oh.

814
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:07,050
Well, how do we prevent that?

815
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,609
I wish I knew, I only...

816
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,948
I know.

817
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,424

the boat you need.

What do you want
with a Lamprey anyway?

823
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,213
It's more what the
Lamprey wants with me.

824
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,754
(CHUCKLES) Oh, shit.

825
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,619
You poked the wrong
bear, sweetness.

826

Well, if you could do magic...

829
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,129
Yeah, well, I can't.

830
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,356
So...

831
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,834
So, you're down to an
early warning device.

832
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,426
An alarm, if you will.

833
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:03,703
So, just maybe, you
still got time to run.

834
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,308
Okay, fine, I'll take it.

835
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,346
What, is that a joke?

00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,176
