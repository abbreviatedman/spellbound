1
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:02,789
<i>Previously, on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,757
Quentin...

3
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:06,537
<i>I killed a god.</i>

4
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:09,148
Gods like Ember have parents, you idiot.

5
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:10,820
<i>When we're harmless, they ignore us.</i>

6
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,233
<i>But when we become malignant,
they amputate.</i>

7
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:16,344
Magic is gone.

8
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:19,241
What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

9
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,766
<i>The woman and child you stole.</i>

10
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,991
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

11
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,151
I had to warn you. They're coming.

12
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:31,588
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

13
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:33,658
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

14
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,560
- You signed that insane contract?
- Yeah, it's okay.

15
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:38,664
- Did you do this for me?
- Just say it.

16
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:39,740
Cancer.

17
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,066
- Call it Cancer plus.
- How long till I die?

18
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:43,133
Two or three weeks.

19
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,322
I need your help.

20
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,392
<i>If Penny's in the library,
he can be your mole.</i>

21
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:47,915
But to do that, he'd have to be alive.

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,908
Deal.

23
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,210
<i>As a niffin, you made enemies.</i>

24
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.</i>

25
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:57,549
The Lambre. It knows you're weak.

26
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,082
<i>It knows you're here.</i>

27
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:02,219
<i>He raped me.</i>

28
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:03,416
Your son.

29
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:05,777
He turned me into a monster.

30
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:08,457
You're a survivor.

31
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:09,960
<i>Why did you bring me back?</i>

32
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:11,962
<i>I know what you're trying to do.</i>

33
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:16,835
There is no actual evidence
of magical surge.

34
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,665
The best we can do is accept that

35
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,670
and continue our theoretical studies.

36
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:23,072
We all get flashes,

37
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,340
and we can do it again.

38
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,411
How?

39
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:31,476
I have no idea.

40
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:41,590
Nope. Nothing.

41
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,726
No freeze, no boil.

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,761
Shit.

43
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:45,929
It's okay.

44
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,597
You can still do other stuff.

45
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:49,573
Q, I can't do anything real.

46
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,600
It's like there's no pattern to this,

47
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:55,233
nothing that we do can
make it stronger or better.

48
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:58,108
I'm starting to feel like
it's all random, you know?

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,675
Maybe it was a mistake.

50
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,978
Come on, you don't mean that.

51
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,614
What if this is, like, a smudge?

52
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,376
A fingerprint left by OLU when
she gave me back my Shade,

53
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,785
and she didn't even realize?

54
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:10,953
You know, it's like,
whoops, speck of magic.

55
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:12,388
She's a goddess.

56
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,023
Does she seem like the accident type?

57
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,858
Have you met her son?

58
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:19,339
Look, I don't wanna be insensitive...

59
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:22,868
But you still think I somehow
have this because of Reynard.

60
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:25,071
I don't know why you have it.

61
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,672
I just... I-I don't think

62
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:29,809
that we should discount the possibility.

63
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,945
I mean, you've had...

64
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:35,881
More contact with gods than most.

65
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,350
That's a nicer way of putting it.

66
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,787
For the record, I'm still
leaning towards fluke.

67
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,690
So it's a fluke. There's still something

68
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,658
that could lead us to something.

69
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,795
We have got to keep
chipping away at it, Jules.

70
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,331
Big words coming from a guy who's mostly

71
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:52,831
chain-smoking and binge-watching

72
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,365
"Six Feet Under" when I got here.

73
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,725
You fired me up.

74
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,637
You showed me that
there's a fight to fight.

75
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:01,774
Now I am the official sidekick

76
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,143
to whatever it turns out you are, okay?

77
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:07,245
So, get used to it.

78
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,336
Wake up, asshole.

79
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:24,831
What, were you a boy scout?
These are great.

80
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,333
Not a good time to go with smart-ass.

81
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,802
I'm not a killer, but times are strange

82
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,671
and you're the one
who broke into my home.

83
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:32,838
Yeah, well, I'm a librarian.

84
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,207
You're ignoring our requests.

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,742
That book was overdue.

86
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:38,176
Overdue book? Come on.

87
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,364
It's my job.

88
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:43,059
What's the Library's real game?

89
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,850
Books?

90
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:46,351
Why do you care anymore?

91
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:50,189
'Cause what the hell else
is there to do anymore?

92
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,925
Man, hey, that thing...

93
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,895
- Is not your business.
- It's Mayakovsky's spell, right?

94
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,304
Little something the brew up current?

95
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:58,397
It's fake.

96
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,065
It does not make magic.

97
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,935
It does blow up like a meth lab.

98
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,405
You met Mayakovsky?

99
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:07,707
I'd know his spellwork anywhere.

100
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:08,916
Yeah, me too, and I'm telling you...

101
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,842
All of this is his fault.

102
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,112
It... by his, you mean...

103
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:16,014
Made a bunch
of apocalypse-proof batteries,

104
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,184
then did something to turn
it all off all over the world.

105
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,187
Breaks his Incorporate Bond,

106
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,158
screws us, he's got magic, he's free.

107
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:28,178
Tell you what Mayakovsky
didn't think about...

108
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,225
Creatures. They're fine.

109
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,466
Whatever they are, it's DNA.

110
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,935
So I hear.

111
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:40,807
We're fish bait now.

112
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,775
Thank God I got this place,

113
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,177
'cause they're coming.

114
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,344
I promise you.

115
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:55,053
Well, karma is a righteous bitch.

116
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,254
Karma's gonna be...

117
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,018
we kill them all, son.

118
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,399
If you can.

119
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,558
I mean, some of them look just like us.

120
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,274
You'd never know
they're not quite human.

121
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,396
I like the little apron.

122
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:39,131
Penny.

123
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,033
Penny.

124
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,969
You shouldn't be here.

125
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,545
You don't have that kind
of time to waste.

126
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:45,971
It's not wasted.

127
00:05:46,004 --> 00:05:47,172
They treating you okay?

128
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:50,009
Everything's fine. It's all fine.

129
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,111
Nothing is fine.

130
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm looking at you. There's that.

131
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:55,982
You look good.

132
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:57,149
White-knuckle sobriety

133
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:59,184
and forced celibacy's my look.

134
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,954
You need to go back.

135
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,165
I-I was kinda thinking we were

136
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,958
gonna grab a quickie in the car.

137
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,561
Yeah, that sounds great,

138
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:11,163
except I don't have a car, and...

139
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,559
and you're fucking dying.

140
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,632
Worth it.

141
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:21,975
Go.

142
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,943
I love you.

143
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,280
Go.

144
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,057
We don't have the funds to...

145
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,926
We're just going to have to borrow.

146
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,227
Begging Pardon, but Tick is right.

147
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:54,606
Excuse me, Sire.

148
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:58,543
Your Majesty?

149
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,388
Look,

150
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,624
there is no unshitty answer
to any of this, people,

151
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,219
so suck it up.

152
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,405
Mmm.

153
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,439
Yeah.

154
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,243
We need to discuss the borders.

155
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:33,211
Great.

156
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,379
After lunch.

157
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,415
Thank you. Dismissed.

158
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,587
We have things to discuss, dear.

159
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,288
- Fabulous.
- Not you.

160
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,891
Your long-suffering high queen.

161
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,393
You may go.

162
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,296
Margo, stay.

163
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,577
Lumbricus Campestris.

164
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,670
Don't tell me.

165
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,679
Feather of a left-handed crow?

166
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:02,474
Butterfly with PMS this time?

167
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:06,394
Turtle semen with a rosemary garnish?

168
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,280
It's a type of earthworm.

169
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:12,451
It lives abundantly in the
grounds around the castle.

170
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:14,120
Collect them all.

171
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,356
Okay.

172
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:23,194
Really enjoying our ongoing whimsy-fest,

173
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:28,033
but I am a tad busy trying to
keep the country from starving,

174
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:30,391
- so...
- Better hurry, then.

175
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,116
You were gone too long.

176
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,796
Was I?

177
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:54,427
Thought I was...

178
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,228
You have to move quickly out there.

179
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:59,007
Every time you leave this
branch, you go where

180
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:01,033
time moves normally
and where time progresses...

181
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,336
So does my super cancer, I know.

182
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,379
It's a pity the best y'all
could do was a place where

183
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:07,273
time stopped.

184
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:09,075
You know, time going backward?

185
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,276
That'd be better.

186
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,582
I've been giving you assignments

187
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,041
that shouldn't take more than an hour.

188
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,868
- I don't want you...
- Me to die?

189
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:17,516
How sweet of you,

190
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:20,552
considering you poisoned me.

191
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:22,555
You know that wasn't me.

192
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:24,622
No one wants you to die.

193
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,325
I know.

194
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,461
You know, travelers? Hard to come by.

195
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,595
I wish you wouldn't be so cynical.

196
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you. You need to rest.

197
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,135
How is it?

198
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:40,896
Out there?

199
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,343
Depressing.

200
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:57,788
- Henry.
- Ah.

201
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:02,194
Is that... is that Irene McAllistair?

202
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,130
Well, it is good to see you.

203
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,200
And how is the...

204
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,536
The board of trustees?

205
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,405
Oh, well, out of their minds.

206
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,740
Well, I don't need to tell you
how many of their companies

207
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,275
went belly up when magic died.

208
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:19,906
You do not. I have stock in several.

209
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,646
- Join the club.
- Yeah.

210
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,152
And your family?

211
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,420
Well, you know them.

212
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:31,256
Stuffy, cautious... survive anything.

213
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,292
But the rest of the board...

214
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:38,696
Look, Henry, I came here
alone because I respect you.

215
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,100
Well, you taught me
everything that I know.

216
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,436
- No need to exaggerate.
- I'm not.

217
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:46,504
And no one needs to convince me
that this school is important.

218
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:49,174
I gather that's not the case
for everyone.

219
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:51,209
They're panicked.

220
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:52,578
They want magic.

221
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,513
So too do we all.

222
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:56,749
They believe that there's gotta be

223
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,783
something out there somewhere.

224
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,219
Mayakovsky.

225
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,288
He was working on a-a battery.

226
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:04,355
We searched Brakebills South...

227
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:09,294
Still, they feel that, uh,
the resources of this school

228
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:12,331
would be best spent
continuing to search for...

229
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:15,167
I cannot stop my students
from searching.

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,235
But we are a school.

231
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:18,637
We still teach here.

232
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:20,738
It is perhaps more important than ever.

233
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,408
If they don't learn it,

234
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,810
I fear no one will ever again,
you understand?

235
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,277
I fear that too.

236
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,480
But if you don't find them something...

237
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:33,252
The board is gonna
close down Brakebills.

238
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:36,355
You have to give them something, Henry.

239
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:37,723
Quickly.

240
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,742
So, what do you think?

241
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,812
Okay, say you were to do it.

242
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,011
Work your way through some
piddly little Earth gods,

243
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,222
find a way to talk to an actual Old God,

244
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,857
and you say what?

245
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,593
Hi, please reconsider,
even though you are

246
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,062
a billion times smarter than I,
and... and... more powerful,

247
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:05,307
if you could please bring back
magic, that would be great.

248
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:07,042
I don't know, I just...
I figured it couldn't hurt

249
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,070
to get a little closer
and maybe meet someone

250
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,039
who knew more than we do.

251
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,907
- I hear you, Q, I do. I just...
- What?

252
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,910
I wouldn't want what happened to me

253
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,345
to happen to anyone else.

254
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,849
Look, you don't have to come.

255
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,627
I just... I just wanted you to know.

256
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:27,668
Okay, you're gonna do a summoning alone?

257
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:31,525
Yeah.

258
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:33,561
I don't... I don't know.

259
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,463
Okay, say I was willing to risk it.

260
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:40,500
I mean, it requires serious, big magic.

261
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:42,303
Okay, well, cultures all over the world

262
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,905
have believed in these gods.
How did they call them?

263
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,640
Suffice to say, not quite the party

264
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:49,960
I was expecting when
I came down here, but...

265
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,970
I think I could help you.

266
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,849
<i>How can I help you?</i>

267
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,552
Yeah.

268
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,225
I was gonna respond,
and then I remembered

269
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:02,388
there's no point.

270
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:04,291
You can't help Penny anymore.

271
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,852
Says who?

272
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,715
What is that?

273
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,644
I have a job for you.

274
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,717
Earthworms.

275
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,248
Get anyone not actively...

276
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:03,282
Our full team is required
to keep the castle safe.

277
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:05,061
Okay, okay, so get like five
or six and do this for me.

278
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:06,253
Quick and dirty.

279
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,094
Ah, there you are.

280
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,395
Come join.

281
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:16,729
The southern province is

282
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:19,022
whatever the Fillorian word
for bankrupt is.

283
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,248
I need a drink.

284
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,875
So quick, little queen.

285
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,370
Where are the worms?

286
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,231
Don't tell me you sent
someone out to do your work.

287
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,508
I'm a delegator.

288
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:33,046
It's a leadership quality.

289
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,215
You've clearly mastered it.

290
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:37,283
I thought I was clear.

291
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:40,586
They are to be plucked by female hands.

292
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:44,323
And I desire those hands to be yours.

293
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:46,626
But only if you wish to keep them.

294
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,008
Shit!

295
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,639
Now this is bad.

296
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:03,210
I waited till I was sure none of those

297
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:05,612
creepy little no-eyebrow
fuckers were around

298
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,546
before I delegated.

299
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,449
So, how'd she know?

300
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:12,151
And so fast?

301
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,221
All right, so how do you know

302
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:16,421
that he'll even be here tonight?

303
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,692
I mean, there's a million
parties happening all over.

304
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:19,625
Easy.

305
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:21,053
He's on social media?

306
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:22,804
How else are followers
supposed to find him?

307
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,632
Met him by total accident at Art Basel.

308
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:28,368
He kept that party going
eight full days.

309
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,104
Best eight days of my life.

310
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,041
Anyway, that's his thing.

311
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:37,544
Swing in, stoke the party,
soak in the worship, move on.

312
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:39,446
Inspiring, right?

313
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,181
You guys are gonna love him.

Uh, and you can see here

327
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,759
cracks from the swordplay
of King Boris The Softspoken.

328
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,341
That is indeed fascinating.

329
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,610
Mm.

330
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:40,815
Abigail mentioned you have
many fairy guests these days.

331
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,421
Guests,

332
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,282
hostile occupying force,

333
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,579
tomato, tomahto.

334
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,129
I presume you wish to extend the most

335
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:51,297
elegant level of hospitality.

336
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:52,441
Do I?

337
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,627
For this reason, I make you aware of the

338
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,731
corridor built by
High Queen ChenLi the Bookish,

339
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:00,167
of rare stone from the Shivering Sea.

340
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,735
Okay.

341
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:02,869
Why?

342
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:05,805
Unfortunately, certain species

343
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,793
are allergic to the substance.

344
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,343
How allergic?

345
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,949
- Violently, your majesty.
- Good to know.

346
00:17:13,988 --> 00:17:16,623
We advise that your guests
cannot tolerate that area

347
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,119
so if you are looking for them,

348
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:22,542
they will undoubtedly be

349
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,192
somewhere else.

350
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,628
A-plus, Rafe.

351
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,019
Huh.

352
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,833
If Rafe says so, guess maybe
we're not the first royals

353
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,369
living a 24/7 fairy reach-around.

354
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,646
So what the hell are we gonna do?

355
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,417
About Queen Bitch and all
her spooky little bitches?

356
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,977
Poison sounds nice.

357
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,813
Shockingly,
all books on poison disappeared

358
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:49,401
from the royal library right
around the time they arrived.

359
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,250
They're armed, they're smart,

360
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:52,652
they're multitudinous,

361
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:53,796
they are invisible to the guard...

362
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,255
When you put it that way.

363
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:57,356
What if they know about this in Loria?

364
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,359
If I send Idri a message...

365
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:00,839
Worst case he comes here,

366
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,763
you look at him naked
and cheer up a little.

367
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,064
How dare you make me sound that shallow,

368
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:06,367
but yes.

369
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:11,772
Hi.

370
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,340
Great to see you, as always.

371
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,042
I'll go write that letter.

372
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:16,242
To who?

373
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,344
Not Idri of Loria?

374
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:19,880
Actually, yes.

375
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:23,449
Our crops are dying now that
we can't schedule the rain.

376
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:25,385
I hope he can help.

377
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,955
His library, like yours,
has of course been purged

378
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:32,407
of any material
pertaining to our species.

379
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:36,129
And any Lorian aware
of the existence of fairies

380
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,466
has been instructed
to keep their mouth shut

381
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:42,134
or lose their tongue.

382
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:45,784
Please don't underestimate me again.

383
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,815
It hurts my feelings.

384
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,945
We're gonna go take
a walk and have a good think

385
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,771
about our behavior.

386
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,025
Come on, we not fun yet?

387
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,198
Yeah, do we not... do we not amuse!

388
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,500
Do we not amuse?

389
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,559
Hey.

390
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,908
I think I... I think I got it, Q.

391
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,110
Okay. Oof.

392
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:24,944
Remember that time, 10th grade, right?

393
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,413
And we made up that dance
and it was terrible.

394
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,849
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

395
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,485
So white and bad.

396
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,314
Yeah, that might actually work.

397
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,454
It was very, like,
hip thrusty if I remember.

398
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,830
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.
I remember it, my friend.

399
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,877

425
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,333
Magicians, right?

426
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,467
Yeah, how can you tell?

427
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,368
Your hands,

428
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:59,206
and your crazy level of trauma.

429
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,309
Cheers to that.

430
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,707
Ugh.

431
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:09,022
Going again.

432
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:13,253
Part deux.

433
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,511
I just, I w...

434
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:17,966
we would kind of really love to talk.

435
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,425
Kid, I'm Bacchus.

436
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:23,596
I am the god of not being
a wiggly, little anxious

437
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,297
wet dish rag that would

438
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,199
kind of really love to talk to you,

439
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:31,844
so I need you to unclench
your vagina and do that shot

440
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,313
or I'm moving on.

441
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:35,541
Just a little sexist.

442
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:37,544
Five, four,

443
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,993
three, two...

444
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:43,149
Attaboy.

445
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:44,650
Okay, what do you wanna do now?

446
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,119
Twister? You wanna pierce something?

447
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:48,654
Oh, I've got

448
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:52,092
Trivial Pursuit Star Trek edition.

449
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:53,559
Just... Mr. Bacchus, we...

450
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:57,344
Magic, and how it's completely gone.

451
00:21:57,563 --> 00:22:01,126
Magic is gone for you little guys?

452
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,068
You don't say.

453
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:04,905
What is... all over the U.S.?

454
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:06,506
All over everywhere, we think.

455
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,374
I've been a little

456
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,124
out of touch.

457
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:13,077
Well, that sucks for you.

458
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:14,999
Why?

459
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:16,937
Well...

460
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,940
I, um...

461
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:20,626
Sort of killed a-a god.

462
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,595
A minor... like, a very, you know...

463
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,124
- We had to.
- A minor god.

464
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:26,253
Not because we wanted to,
but just because we had to.

465
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,360
- You understand...
- Who?

466
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:31,497
Who the fuck did you kill?

467
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:34,933
Um, Ember in...

468
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:36,303
Fillory?

469
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,635
I don't know that guy.

470
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:46,311
Deserved it. I...

471
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:51,906
Tough choices make a man, man.

472
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,655
- Yeah.
- Open your mouth.

473
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,523
- Sorry?
- Like, open your mouth.

474
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:01,527
Happy birthday.

475
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,331
Okay, so this is gonna be

476
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,999
a little bit more
challenging than we expected.

477
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:08,601
What did you put in my mouth?

478
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,326
Alice? Where are you going?

479
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:36,203
I can't do this.
I can't study dead magic.

480
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,768
- I can't...
- Can we just...

481
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:40,199
go sit down somewhere and talk, please?

482
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,415
Stop. Look, here's the deal.

483
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,143
I thought if we hung out, maybe had sex,

484
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,372
I don't know, went to school,
it would feel like it did.

485
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,508
I thought I could forgive you,
but I can't.

486
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,110
I just...

487
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,893
Say good-bye and let me go.

488
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:54,714
Good-bye, Alice.

489
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,283
Alice?

490
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,590
Nope.

Sorry.

499
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:45,946

501
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:48,567
Very high.

502
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:50,437
I get it.

503
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,541
Does your high ever turn on you

504
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:57,142
and you go from happy to

505
00:24:57,176 --> 00:25:00,112

a barren world devoid of magic?

by a trickster god.

509
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:13,595
Long story.

510
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,876
I got time.

511
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,530
Let's talk about something else.

512
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:19,666
Sure.

513
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,821
Sure, whatever you...

514
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:26,264
Hey, you ever, uh...

515
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,717
I'm sorry.

516
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:32,170
I just really loved doing magic.

517
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,248
And I was good at it.

518
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,757
You should have tasted my tomatoes.

519
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,351
And just, the air
smelled different, right?

520
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,756
And I could turn into a bird,
or... or... or...

521
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:46,014
make a rose bloom.

522
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,936
And I saw actual Fillory.

523
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,163
And I banged a werewolf, yes.

524
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:54,434
That is weird, but also rad,
because who gets to do that?

525
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:59,426
And I wasn't just some
extremely average nobody.

526
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,082
I was gifted.

527
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:03,996
I didn't just belong somewhere.

528
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,499
I belonged anywhere
because I was a Magician.

529
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:13,491
I just...

530
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:17,891
I don't even know what
anything is even about anymore.

531
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:25,832
Maybe there's a way to get it back.

532
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,900
Look, no offense,

533
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:30,010
I've been researching, and...

534
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,510

Mm-mm.

544
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:09,475
No, I can't even blow one.

545
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:10,642
How?

546
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:15,314
I don't know yet.

547
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:18,266
Julia.

548
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,424
Q!

549
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:22,387
<i>♪ You and me ♪</i>

550
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,724
Stop, Q, you're giving me the spins...

551
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:26,458
Look, I know that you're blasted, but...

552
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:28,186
- You're blasted!
- Yeah, but even I know that

553
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,272
you cannot show people that.

554
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:31,499
Why not?

555
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,008
Because if the wrong people found out...

556
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:35,400
He is not the wrong people.

557
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,703
I can't go through the rest of my life

558
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:38,938
just not trusting anyone.

559
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,465
I feel fucked up enough.

560
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,170
I get that.

561
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,845
Just put yourself in my shoes
just for one second, Q.

562
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:48,781
I have magic.

563
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,749
And what does it do?

564
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:51,985
More or less jack shit.

565
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:54,453
And I see someone whose entire life

566
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,688
would change if he could just see it.

567
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:58,975
<i>♪ Summer feelings are waiting ♪</i>

568
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,860
I have to be able
to do something with it.

569
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,996
And if that's cheer up Josh Hoberman,

570
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:04,396
then I'll take it.

571
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,257
Because I can't... you know,

572
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,834
I can't be so precious with
something that is so small.

573
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:10,999
It's not small, it's the...

574
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:14,065
it's the biggest magic, Jules.

575
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:16,291
'Cause as far as we know,

576
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:20,045
for us little guys,
it's the only magic out there.

577
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,322
Oww! What... oww.

578
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:30,932
Dude, you're gonna leave
a mark and I don't like that

579
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:32,525
in a non-sexual context.

580
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:35,027
Okay, okay, okay, okay, um...

581
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:39,074
You watched "Battlestar," right?

582
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,932
Yeah, I love when they
do terrorism allegory

583
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:43,113
- with mostly white people.
- Mm-hmm.

584
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,770
You remember Grace Park in season one?

585
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:45,938
Of course, best storyline.

586
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,073
- Why?
- Duh...

587
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,340
because she was actually...

588
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,976
You're Grace Park.

589
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,376
Okay?

590
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,314
You're Grace Park, Margo.

591
00:28:58,016 --> 00:28:59,619
I'm Grace Park.

592
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:00,819
Yeah.

593
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,421
And we have ourselves a bit of a

594
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:03,856
Gene Hackman in "The Conversation."

595
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,101
- I didn't see that one.
- Yeah, right, um...

596
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:11,297
Someone is "xoxo,
Gossip Girl"-ing our shit.

597
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:15,734
Remember James Marsden in X-Men, hm?

598
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,403
Your Marsden is xoxo-ing us

599
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:20,540
full on that great song by The Police.

600
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:25,135
That Fairuza Balk in "The Craft."

601
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,496
Yeah, more Cersei Lannister.

602
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,425
Hey, glad I made you read those.

603
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:34,453
Well, I read the Wiki.

604
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,421
What? Those books are
like a million pages long.

605
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:37,756
- I have a life.
- Okay.

606
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:38,990
Anyway,

607
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:41,093
whatever your Marsden would xoxo,

608
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,462
Cersei xoxo's.

609
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:44,369
So, we have to keep it very

610
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:46,322
- best episode of "Buffy."
- Musical?

611
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,973
The other one.

612
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,067
Okay.

613
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:51,003
How do we Lizzie Borden

614
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:53,472
the shit out of this thing?

615
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:58,323
'Cause I am about ready
to go full '07 Britney.

616
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:01,981
Maybe we could've back when
this place was Pottered up.

617
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:03,149
Still.

618
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,950
Even without a wand,

619
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:06,852
Harry would figure some shit out.

620
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,123
Honestly, I didn't quite
finish those books either...

621
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:13,027
Our Harry, I mean.

622
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,722
Oh! Him.

623
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:17,163
Well, he'd...

624
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,066
Mm-hmm.

625
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,068
Consult the creepy pedophile.

626
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:24,696
Mmm.

627
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:38,197
We're close, I think.

628
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:40,766
I thought this excursion was
mostly about drinking heavily.

629
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,601
I needed to imply that

630
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:45,779
so we could get away
without extra eyes on us.

631
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:49,141
Fairies, Tick.

632
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:52,211
When magic died, they pounced.

633
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:53,780
Full occupation.

634
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:57,087
This explains so much.

635
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:59,052
What will we do?

636
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:09,385
The white lady was spotted
somewhere around here.

637
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,761
We're going to shoot her,

638
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,588
and then we're going
to wish those fairies

639
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,316
to the fucking cornfield.

640
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,642
Oh, excellent.

641
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,338
Whatever a cornfield is.

642
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:29,513
Oh, whoa!

643
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:31,482
There he is!

644
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,620
Man... or, god, I just...

645
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:37,762
Look, I thank you.

646
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,389
I just... I feel...

647
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:41,121
you know, whatever you
put in my mouth...

648
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:42,828
I just... I feel like...

649
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:45,396
you know, like a sugary cereal

650
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,598
in the good way.

651
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,399
You know? It's like,

652
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:49,835
- whoa!
- Haha, whoa.

653
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,399
- All right.
- Okay.

654
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:53,438
Hey, hey, shots, right?

655
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,440
Shots, shots, shots, shots.

656
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:57,408
You and me. Shots, shots.

657
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,844
I love you, I love you.

658
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,146
♪ I'm falling on my knees ♪

659
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:04,553
♪ In worship of you ♪

660
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:07,819
Yeeeah.

661
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:09,120
Look, so, anyway,

662
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:10,821
I was thinking, while we're here,

663
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,804
maybe I could ask you a few questions.

664
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,025
Dude.

665
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,827
You're a vibe-killer.

666
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:17,596
- No.
- Yes, you are.

667
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:20,414
And historically,
I do smite vibe-killers.

668
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:21,867
No, look, I'm a vibe-supporter.

669
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:24,703
I just also happen to be
a concerned Magician individual

670
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,037
who would like to get
a word in with your parents.

671
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,408
My parents?

672
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:33,299
Yeah, the Old Gods.

673
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:38,582
Are imperious and distant dickwads

674
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:40,684
who I haven't spoken to in a millennia.

675
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:43,954
Rambo!

676
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:46,580
Let's get that foam gun loaded, baby.

677
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,252
Um...

678
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:51,695
Look, I know that this
really wasn't on your radar

679
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:53,198
until you met us, but we've lost

680
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,429
our most precious resource.

681
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:58,225
Dude, stop, okay?

682
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,178
If fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

683
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,072
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

684
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,809
that I met back in Athens one time.

685
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,177
Rambo! Rambo!

686
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,213
What was the name of that guy
that I met in Athens,

687
00:33:08,245 --> 00:33:10,147
that up-with-humans guy?

688
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,516
Fit bod.

689
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,624
You mean Prometheus?

690
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,751
Prom...

691
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,519
That guy loved Magicians,

692
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:17,555
and he would want to help you.

693
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:18,623
He's dead.

694
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,125
What?

695
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:24,195
Prometheus died,
like, 1,500 years ago, man.

696
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,504
Sorry.

697
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,731
Damn it.

698
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,702
Well, he lived
a pretty tortured existence,

699
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:34,798
so, dying was probably a relief for him.

700
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:39,144
But, still, uh, he would've helped you.

701
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,787
He told me this crazy story one time

702
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:45,015
about how there's like...

703
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:48,848
like, a secret back door to magic.

704
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:50,987
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

705
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,925
I don't remember the deets,
okay, my face was melting off.

706
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:57,881
Secret back door.

707
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,241
- Just, something...
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:03,506
Wait!

709
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:06,553
Might've been a brothel.

710
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,213
Shots.

711
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:16,747
Tick?

712
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:21,182
Tick?

713
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:22,846
Shit.

714
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:39,808
Not the best idea, Eliot.

715
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:43,307
Um...

716
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:47,646
I was looking for the White Lady.

717
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:48,847
Is this she?

718
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,057
Look, if you don't come out of there,

719
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:01,593
I'm going to have to shoot you.

720
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:02,486
Gods!

721
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:04,261
Have you never given a compliment?

722
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,563
For example,

723
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:08,133
my, my, High King Eliot.

724
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:12,169
Your long legs look
so well in those breeches.

725
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,414
Thank you.

726
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:18,042
Your turn.

727
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:22,735
You sound like a...

728
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,161
very attractive Creature.

729
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,350
You think so?

730
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:28,218
I've met many non-humans,

731
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,921
and your voice is

732
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,940
by far the...

733
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:33,357
sexiest.

734
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,659
- Really?
- I mean, you sound noble.

735
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,838
- I didn't mean...
- You're wise,

736
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:41,838
for I am, indeed,

737
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,522
the sexiest in the land.

738
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:45,936
It is I,

739
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:49,077
the Great Cock of The Darkling Woods.

740
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,077
The Great...

741
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:52,413
Cock.

742
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:54,746
Have you never beheld one,
child of Earth?

743
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:57,815
No, no. No, I've beheld one or two.

744
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,919
But you are, by far, the most majestic.

745
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,082
I'm diligent about hydration.

746
00:36:03,282 --> 00:36:07,073
All right, petitioner, let's chat.

747
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:35,300
I like your style.

748
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:37,716
What is the point of hearing a petition

749
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,677
if the aesthetics are shit?

750
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,325
I need help with a fairy thing.

751
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:51,474
Tribal matriarchies
are the absolute worst.

752
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:55,020
So, I was just hoping in

753
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:58,615
your great, benevolent handsomeness

754
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,719
that you would see fit to grant
me just one little wish.

755
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:03,219
That's the sort of thing my sister,

756
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:04,888
The Winter's Doe, specializes in.

757
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:07,858
Also, when was the last time
a petitioner didn't get

758
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,120
utterly assfucked by a wish-granting?

759
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:13,217
Yeah.

760
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,622
And yet...

761
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,367
I'll do you better.

762
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:18,769
There's a problem
far greater than fairies.

763
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,271
Solve it, they're nothing.

764
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:26,437
I'll send you on an epic quest.

765
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,656
That's...

766
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,200
Ahh.

767
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:32,712
Wow, that's great. Thank you.

768
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:35,919
It's just...

769
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,253
My people need help.

770
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,105
- They sure do.
- Today.

771
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:41,367
The Fairy Queen is sitting
on my throne as we speak.

772
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:43,366
Do you want your magic back or not?

773
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:45,228
Will it not solve all your problems?

774
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,253
I mean, yes, but,

775
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:48,741
it's just...

776
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,218
how long does a quest like this take?

777
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,437
A good season.

778
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,605
Right.

779
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:57,054
My kingdom is in trouble now.

780
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:00,427
You are a good king.

781
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,552
But it is time

782
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,349
to become a great one.

783
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:08,819
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

784
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:12,095
where you are no king, no Magician,

785
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:16,142
just a vulnerable man.

786
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,321
Honestly,

787
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:20,965
that sounds like something
I might really fuck up.

788
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:24,348
Yes, or it wouldn't be a quest.

789
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,856
You have friends, don't you?

790
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:32,130
I used to.

791
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,459
The one-eyed conqueror,

792
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,591
the traveler, the warrior,

793
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,138
the fool, the god-touched,

794
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,592
the lover of tomatoes,

795
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:43,653
and the torture artist...

796
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,256
Wait, which one is that?

797
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,915
- You lost me there.
- Nevermind.

798
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,026
You have a brother of the heart

799
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:50,928
with the foppy hair.

800
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,612
- That would be Quentin.
- You're parts of one whole.

801
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:56,283
No one can do this alone.

802
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,876
Okay.

803
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,949
FYI, I can't contact them
or reach them in any way.

804
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,340
You must find the book with no author.

805
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,755
A tale for children,
but they're hardly that.

806
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,184
There is the key... or, the keys...

807
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:12,005
in a place called...

808
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,227
Public Library.

809
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,636
In the shire of Chester

810
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,557
in the land of New Jersey.

811
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,358
Again, that sure sounds like Earth.

812
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:24,895
Eliot, the quest I bestow on you

813
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,964
is the task you were born for.

814
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,532
Claim it.

815
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:39,843
Abigail,

816
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:40,910
talking-animal question.

817
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,680
So, bunnies.

818
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,319
Her Sluggishness has noted
that you are aware

819
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,465
of their messenger abilities.

820
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,656
So, that is what the
Fairy Queen uses them for?

821
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:56,028
Bunnies move easily between worlds.

822
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:58,639
And do they serve her?

823
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,064
And if so, how loyally?

824
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,533
Every bunny for itself, Majesty.

825
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:06,332
Thank you.

826
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:21,662
Need help.

827
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,416
Love, Eliot.

828
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,244
Q.

829
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,633
I think this is it.

830
00:40:45,697 --> 00:40:47,199
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

831
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:50,422
No author, I mean, I can feel
something coming off of it.

832
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:59,032
Interesting.

833
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,444
Interesting.

834
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:21,866
Yeah, if by interesting,
you mean, blank, sure.

835
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,989
Quests never give away the farm.

836
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:26,458
You've gotta earn everything.

837
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:29,995
Jules, this is our quest.

838
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,162
And we're already on it.

839
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,997
- Epic Quest.
- We have to.

840
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,013
- Map from the book.
- Work together.

841
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,677
- Also I think...
- Eliot.

842
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,480
- Epic Quest.
- The Great Cock.

843
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:43,909
- It's called After Island.
- A back door to...

844
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:45,119
- The Great Cock.
- Epic quest.

845
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:46,377
- Keys.
- Here's the deal.

846
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:48,447
- Epic quest.
- All seven keys.

847
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:51,449
- Here's the deal.
- Epic quest.

848
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,424
Just shush for one second, please.

849
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:56,388
Oh.

850
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:01,273
Uh, that one.

851
00:42:01,426 --> 00:42:02,828
Put him first.

852
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:07,832
Your father and I are so proud of you.

853
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:13,320
Okay...

854
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:17,976
We are go for epic quest.

855
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,015
You are indeed a brave king.

856
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:22,882
I am indeed a guy with not much choice,

857
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,523
but thanks for rounding up.

858
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,485
We're looking for keys.

859
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:31,122
Q and Julia believe
whatever the keys unlock,

860
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,005
will help restore magic.

861
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:36,669
And they think the first key
is here in Fillory.

862
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:38,163
Excellent.

863
00:42:38,196 --> 00:42:40,450
Some place called After Island?

864
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:42,009
Oh.

865
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,338
It lies beyond our border, Majesty.

866
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,250
You would be venturing
to strange lands not your own.

867
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:52,369
So, not the friendliest?

868
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:54,980
It is said that even
the Outer Sea itself

869
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:57,415
wishes ill upon our king.

870
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:59,125
Some have sailed before you...

871
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,553
Oh, and how'd that go?

872
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:01,953
They drowned.

873
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:03,629
Oh.

874
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:07,292
Well, how do we prevent that?

875
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:08,961
I wish I knew, I only...

876
00:43:08,993 --> 00:43:10,910
I know.

877
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:14,366
I know exactly the boat you need.

878
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:31,249
Ugh, okay! That's enough.

879
00:43:31,283 --> 00:43:33,866
Let's talk.

880
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:37,338
So transactional.

881
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:40,225
What do you want with a Lamprey anyway?

882
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:42,428
It's more what
the Lamprey wants with me.

883
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,062
Oh, shit.

884
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:45,965
You poked the wrong bear, sweetness.

885
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,954
Just tell me what you know.

886
00:43:48,448 --> 00:43:49,750
Please?

887
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:50,945
Well, if you could do magic...

888
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:52,845
Yeah, well, I can't.

889
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,798
So...

890
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:58,225
So, you're down
to an early warning device.

891
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,612
An alarm, if you will.

892
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,726
So, just maybe,

893
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:04,515
you still got time to run.

894
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,586
Okay, fine, I'll take it.

895
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,834
What, is that a joke?

896
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:16,647
I gave up jokes 80 years ago.

897
00:44:16,694 --> 00:44:19,516
Tired of being misunderstood.

898
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:21,273
So get one,

899
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,516
and keep it on your person at all times.

900
00:44:25,136 --> 00:44:27,272
Buena suerte.

901
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:51,640
Just a side of bacon, please.
