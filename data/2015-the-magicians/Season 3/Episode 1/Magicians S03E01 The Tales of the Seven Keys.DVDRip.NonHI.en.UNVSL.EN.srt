1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,764
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,169
Quentin...

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,400
<i>I killed a god.</i>

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,306
Gods like Ember
have parents, you idiot.

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,208
<i>When we're harmless,
they ignore us.</i>

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,212
<i>But when we become
malignant, they amputate.</i>

7
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,111
Magic is gone.

8
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,243
What is it that you
seek, rude little Earth girl?

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,515
<i>The woman and child you stole.</i>

10
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,057
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

11
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,181
I had to warn you.

12
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,259
They're coming.

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,824
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,891
Unlimited manual
and magical labor?

15
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,799
You signed that insane contract?

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,869
Yeah, it's okay.

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,495
Did you do this
for me? Just say it.

18
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,572
<i>Cancer.</i>

19
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,165
Call it cancer plus.
How long till I die?

20
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,242
Two or three weeks.

21
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,343
I need your help.

22
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,055
<i>If Penny's in the Library,
he can be your mole.</i>

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,911
But to do that, he'd
have to be alive.

24
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,282
Deal.

25
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,382
<i>As a Niffin, you made enemies.</i>

26
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,354
<i>I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.</i>

27
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,550
The Lamprey. It
knows you're weak.

28
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,217
<i>It knows you're here.</i>

29
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,987
<i>He raped me.</i>

30
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,155
Your son.

31
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,597
He turned me into a monster.

32
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,565
You're a survivor.

33
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,635
<i>Why did you bring me back?</i>

34
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,705
<i>I know what you're trying to do.</i>

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,471
There is no actual
evidence of magical surge.

36
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:21,448
The best we can do is accept that
and continue our theoretical studies.

37
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,575
We all get flashes,
and we can do it again.

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,111
How?

39
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,318
I have no idea.

40
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,558
Nope. Nothing.

41
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,729
No freeze, no boil.

42
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,804
Shit.

43
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,964
It's okay.

44
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,564
You can still do other stuff.

45
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,507
Q, I can't do anything real.

46
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,579
It's like there's
no pattern to this,

47
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,945
nothing that we do can
make it stronger or better.

48
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,212
I'm starting to feel like
it's all random, you know?

49
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,651
Maybe it was a mistake.

50
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,052
Come on, you don't mean that.

51
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,591
What if this is, like, a smudge?

52
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,287
A fingerprint left by O.L.U. when
she gave me back my Shade,

53
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,795
and she didn't even realize?

54
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,989
You know, it's like,
whoops, speck of magic.

55
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,293
She's a goddess.

56
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,096
Does she seem like
the accident type?

57
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,897
Have you met her son?

58
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,269
Look, I don't wanna
be insensitive...

59
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,673
But you still think I somehow
have this because of Reynard.

60
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,938
I don't know why you have it.

61
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:29,143
I just... I don't think that we
should discount the possibility.

62
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,777
I mean, you've had...

63
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,913
More contact with
gods than most.

64
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,851
That's a nicer
way of putting it.

65
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,551
For the record, I'm still
leaning towards fluke.

66
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,429
So it's a fluke. There's still something
that could lead us to something.

67
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,560
We have got to keep
chipping away at it, Jules.

68
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,264
Big words coming
from a guy who's mostly

69
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,331
chain-smoking and binge-watching
<i>Six Feet Under</i> when I got here.

70
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,807
You fired me up.

71
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,368
You showed me that
there's a fight to fight.

72
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:04,008
Now I am the official sidekick to
whatever it turns out you are, okay?

73
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,916
So, get used to it.

74
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,223
Wake up, asshole.

75
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,285
Ah.

76
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,603
What, were you a boy scout?

77
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,831
These are great.

78
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,238
Not a good time to
go with smart-ass.

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,607
I'm not a killer, but times are strange
and you're the one who broke into my home.

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,839
Yeah, well, I'm a Librarian.

81
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,313
You're ignoring our requests.

82
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,713
That book was overdue.

83
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,411
Overdue book? Come on.

84
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,952
It's my job.

85
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,883
What's the Library's real game?

86
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,855
Books?

87
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,484
Why do you care anymore?

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,258
'Cause what the hell else
is there to do anymore?

89
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,534
Man, hey, that thing...
Is not your business.

90
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,400
It's Mayakovsky's spell, right?
Little something to brew up current?

91
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,528
It's fake.

92
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,096
It does not make magic.

93
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,938
It does blow up like a meth lab.

94
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,535
You met Mayakovsky?

95
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,638
I'd know his spellwork anywhere.

96
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,958
Yeah, me too,
and I'm telling you...

97
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,814
All of this is his fault.

98
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,182
It... By his, you mean...

99
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,052
Made a bunch of
apocalypse-proof batteries,

100
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,252
then did something to turn
it all off all over the world.

101
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,230
Breaks his Incorporate Bond,
screws us, he's got magic, he's free.

102
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,427
Tell you what Mayakovsky
didn't think about...

103
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,471
Creatures. They're fine.

104
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,598
Whatever they are, it's DNA.

105
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,903
So I hear.

106
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,774
We're fish bait now.

107
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,249
Thank God I got this
place, 'cause they're coming.

108
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,444
I promise you.

109
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,827
Well, karma is
a righteous bitch.

110
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,228
Karma's gonna be...
We kill them all, son.

111
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,391
If you can.

112
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,560
I mean, some of
them look just like us.

113
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,161
You'd never know
they're not quite human.

114
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,301
I like the little apron.

115
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,963
Penny.

116
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,837
What the hell are you...

117
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,773
Oh, you shouldn't be here.

118
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,483
You don't have that
kind of time to waste.

119
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,773
It's not wasted.

120
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,007
They treating you okay?

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,811
Everything's
fine. It's all fine.

122
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,909
Nothing is fine.

123
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,850
I'm looking at
you. There's that.

124
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,546
You look good.

125
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,057
Huh. White-knuckle sobriety
and forced celibacy's my look.

126
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,728
You need to go back.

127
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,061
I was kinda thinking we were
gonna grab a quickie in the car.

128
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,998
Yeah, that sounds great,
except I don't have a car, and...

129
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,939
And you're fucking dying.

130
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,935
Worth it.

131
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,809
Go.

132
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,741
I love you.

133
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,178
Go.

134
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,860
We don't have the funds to...

135
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,695
We're just going
to have to borrow.

136
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,928
Begging Pardon,
but Tick is right.

137
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,542
Excuse me, Sire.

138
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,749
Your Majesty?

139
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,224
Look, there is no
unshitty answer

140
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,063
to any of this,
people, so suck it up.

141
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,637
Oh. Oh-oh.

142
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,279
Mmm. Yeah.

143
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,078
Ahem. We need to
discuss the borders.

144
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,151
Great.

145
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,246
After lunch.

146
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,313
Thank you. Dismissed.

147
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,926
We have things to discuss, dear.

148
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,554
Fabulous. Not you.

149
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,031
Your long-suffering high queen.

150
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,259
You may go.

151
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,826
Margo, stay.

152
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,435
<i>Lumbricus Campestris.</i>

153
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,568
Oh, don't tell me.

154
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,812
Feather of a left-handed crow?

155
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,576
Butterfly with PMS this time?

156
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,142
Turtle semen with
a rosemary garnish?

157
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,313
It's a type of earthworm.

158
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:12,018
It lives abundantly in the
grounds around the castle.

159
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,850
Collect them all.

160
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,492
Okay.

161
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,198
Really enjoying our
ongoing whimsy-fest,

162
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:28,003
but I am a tad busy trying to
keep the country from starving,

163
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,339
so... Better hurry, then.

164
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,789
You were gone too long.

165
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,225
Was I?

166
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,126
Thought I was...

167
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,236
You have to move
quickly out there.

168
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,015
Every time you leave
this branch, you go where

169
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,008
time moves normally and
where time progresses...

170
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,373
So does my super cancer, I know.

171
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,607
It's a pity the best y'all could do
was a place where time stopped.

172
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,046
You know, time going backward?

173
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,276
That'd be better.

174
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,183
I've been giving you assignments
that shouldn't take more than an hour.

175
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,983
I don't want you... Me to die?

176
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,858
How sweet of you,
considering you poisoned me.

177
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,051
You know that wasn't me.

178
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,220
No one wants you to die.

179
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,357
I know.

180
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,527
You know, Travelers?
Hard to come by.

181
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,729
I wish you wouldn't
be so cynical.

182
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,172
Thank you. You need to rest.

183
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,704
How is it?

184
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,279
Out there?

185
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,246
Depressing.

186
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,763
Henry.

187
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,959
Is that... Is that
Irene McAllistair?

188
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,902
Well, it is good to see you.

189
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,973
Oh, and how is the...

190
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,407
The board of trustees?

191
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,242
Oh, well, out of their minds.

192
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,646
Well, I don't need to tell you
how many of their companies

193
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,080
went belly up when magic died.

194
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,949
You do not. I have
stock in several.

195
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,578
Join the club. Yeah.

196
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,917
And your family?

197
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,255
Well, you know them.

198
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,059
Stuffy, cautious...
Survive anything.

199
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,101
But the rest of the board...

200
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,805
Look, Henry, I came here
alone because I respect you.

201
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,067
Well, you taught me
everything that I know.

202
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,474
No need to exaggerate. I'm not.

203
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,536
And no one needs to convince
me that this school is important.

204
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,138
I gather that's not
the case for everyone.

205
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,342
They're panicked.

206
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,650
They want magic.

207
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,551
So too do we all.

208
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,921
They believe that there's gotta be
something out there somewhere.

209
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,187
Mayakovsky.

210
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,285
He was working on a battery.

211
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,354
We searched Brakebills South...

212
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:09,300
Still, they feel that the
resources of this school

213
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,339
would be best spent
continuing to search for...

214
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,135
I cannot stop my
students from searching.

215
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,200
But we are a school.

216
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,710
We still teach here.

217
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,837
It is perhaps more
important than ever.

218
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,439
If they don't learn it,

219
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,916
I fear no one will ever
again, you understand?

220
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,281
I fear that too.

221
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,514
But if you don't find
them something...

222
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,217
The board is gonna
close down Brakebills.

223
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,353
You have to give
them something, Henry.

224
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,828
Quickly.

225
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,204
So, what do you think?

226
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,674
Okay, say you were to do it.

227
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,872
Work your way through
some piddly little Earth gods,

228
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,679
find a way to talk to an actual
old god, and you say what?

229
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,582
Hi, please reconsider,
even though you are

230
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,918
a billion times smarter than
I, and... And... More powerful,

231
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,301
if you could please bring
back magic, that would be great.

232
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,936
I don't know, I just... I
figured it couldn't hurt

233
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,930
to get a little closer and
maybe meet someone

234
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,895
who knew more than we do.

235
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,194
I hear you, Q, I do.

236
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,734
I just... What?

237
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,966
I wouldn't want what happened
to me to happen to anyone else.

238
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,641
Look, you don't have to come.

239
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,404
I just... I just
wanted you to know.

240
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,378
Okay, you're gonna
do a summoning alone?

241
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,517
Yeah.

242
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,576
I don't... I don't know.

243
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,417
Okay, say I was
willing to risk it.

244
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,459
I mean, it requires
serious, big magic.

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,771
Okay, well, cultures all over the
world have believed in these gods.

246
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,094
How did they call them?

247
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,709
Suffice to say,
not quite the party

248
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,295
I was expecting when I
came down here, but...

249
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,564
I think I could help you.

250
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,671
How can I help you?

251
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,104
Yeah.

252
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,314
I was gonna respond, and then
I remembered there's no point.

253
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,213
You can't help Penny anymore.

254
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,479
Says who?

255
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,147
What is that?

256
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,989
Ah-haha.

257
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,230
I have a job for you.

258
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,497
Earthworms.

259
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,130
Get anyone not actively...

260
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,176
Our full team is required
to keep the castle safe.

261
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,953
Okay, okay, so get like
five or six and do this for me.

262
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,138
Quick and dirty.

263
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,714
There you are.

264
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,083
Come join.

265
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,520
The southern province is

266
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,818
whatever the Fillorian
word for bankrupt is.

267
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,086
I need a drink.

268
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,704
So quick, little Queen.

269
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,253
Where are the worms?

270
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,094
Don't tell me you sent
someone out to do your work.

271
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,225
I'm a delegator.

272
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,669
It's a leadership quality.

273
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,867
You've clearly mastered it.

274
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,933
I thought I was clear.

275
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,343
They are to be plucked
by female hands.

276
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,349
And I desire those
hands to be yours.

277
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,245
But only if you
wish to keep them.

278
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,696
Shit!

279
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,393
Now this is bad.

280
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,867
I waited till I was
sure none of those

281
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,270
creepy little no-eyebrow fuckers
were around before I delegated.

282
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,137
So, how'd she know?

283
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,768
And so fast?

284
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,449
All right, so how do you know
that he'll even be here tonight?

285
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,527
I mean, there's a million
parties happening all over.

286
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,551
Easy.

287
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,882
He's on social media?

288
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,664
How else are followers
supposed to find him?

289
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,385
Met him by total
accident at Art Basel.

290
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,053
He kept that party
going eight full days.

291
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,731
Best eight days of my life.

292
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,630
Anyway, that's his thing.

293
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,261
Swing in, stoke the party,
soak in the worship, move on.

294
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,134
Inspiring, right?

295
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,797
You guys are gonna love him.

296
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:52,115
Josh "The Animal" Hoberman.

297
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,154
Bacchus.

298
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,653
My deity How you living?

299
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,349
So good.

300
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,353
Um, get your fine
ass in this bitch.

301
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,828
Lucy.

302
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,159
Bong hit.

303
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,834
Come back when you're fun.

304
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,176
My mistress wishes
that I tell you...

305
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,487
Uh, and you can see here

306
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,615
cracks from the swordplay
of King Boris The Softspoken.

307
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,456
That is indeed fascinating.

308
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,527
Hmm.

309
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,031
Abigail mentioned you have
many fairy guests these days.

310
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,468
Guests, hostile occupying
force, tomato, tomahto.

311
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:51,205
I presume you wish to extend
the most elegant level of hospitality.

312
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,642
Do I?

313
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,943
For this reason, I make
you aware of the corridor

314
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,043
built by High Queen Chen Li the Bookish,
of rare stone from the Shivering Sea.

315
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,518
Okay.

316
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,680
Why?

317
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:08,694
Unfortunately, certain species
are allergic to the substance.

318
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,261
How allergic?

319
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,026
Violently, Your Majesty.

320
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,132
Good to know.

321
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,361
We advise that your guests
cannot tolerate that area

322
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,995
so if you are looking for them,

323
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,975
they will undoubtedly
be somewhere else.

324
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,408
A-plus, Rafe.

325
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,617
Huh. If Rafe says so, guess
maybe we're not the first royals

326
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,279
living a 24/7 fairy
reach-around.

327
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,690
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

328
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,404
About Queen Bitch and
all her spooky little bitches?

329
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,828
Poison sounds nice.

330
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,593
Shockingly, all books
on poison disappeared

331
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,032
from the royal library right
around the time they arrived.

332
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,401
They're armed, they're
smart, they're multitudinous,

333
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,615
they are invisible
to the guard...

334
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,164
When you put it that way.

335
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,267
What if they know
about this in Loria?

336
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,277
If I send Idri a message...

337
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,869
Worst case he comes here,

338
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,591
you look at him naked
and cheer up a little.

339
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:06,313
How dare you make me
sound that shallow, but, yes.

340
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,556
Hi.

341
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,252
Great to see you, as always.

342
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,885
I'll go write that letter.

343
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,122
To who?

344
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,254
Not Idri of Loria?

345
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,391
Actually, yes.

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,399
Our crops are dying now
that we can't schedule the rain.

347
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,301
I hope he can help.

348
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,772
His library, like yours,
has of course been purged

349
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,436
of any material
pertaining to our species.

350
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,970
And any Lorian aware
of the existence of fairies

351
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,416
has been instructed
to keep their mouth shut

352
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,977
or lose their tongue.

353
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,422
Please don't
underestimate me again.

354
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,451
It hurts my feelings.

355
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,760
We're gonna go take a
walk and have a good think

356
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,891
about our behavior.

357
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,842
Come on, we not fun yet?

358
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,179
Oh.

359
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,911
Yeah, do we not...
Do we not amuse!

360
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,452
Do we not amuse?

361
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,015
Hey.

362
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,691
I think I... I
think I got it, Q.

363
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:22,955
Okay.

364
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,725
Remember that time,
10th grade, right?

365
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,322
And we made up that
dance and it was terrible.

366
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,628
Oh, God. Yes.

367
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:33,332
So white and bad. Yeah,
that might actually work.

368
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,374
It was very, like, hip
thrusty if I remember.

369
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,498
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

370
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,476
I remember it, my friend. Uh...

371
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,169
<i>Ayo</i>

372
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,574
<i>I'm tired of using technology</i>

373
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,551
<i>Uh! So why don't
you sit in front of me</i>

374
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,447
<i>Ayo</i>

375
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,285
<i>I'm tired of using technology</i>

376
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,555
<i>Uh! I need you
right in front of me</i>

377
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,494
<i>Uh! She wants it Uh-uh!</i>

378
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,225
<i>She wants it</i>

379
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,768
<i>She wants it, so I
gotta give it to her</i>

380
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,599
<i>Ow! She wants it Uh-uh</i>

381
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,537
<i>She wants it</i>

382
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,074
<i>She wants it</i>

383
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,474
<i>So you can
fugging give it to her</i>

384
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,192
Hoberman!

385
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,527
Whoo!

386
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,578
So, welcome.

387
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,209
Magicians, right?

388
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,378
Yeah, how can you tell?

389
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:59,050
Your hands, and your
crazy level of drama.

390
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,192
Cheers to that.

391
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,926
Uh...

392
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,793
Going again.

393
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,104
Part <i>deux.</i>

394
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,733
I just, I w... We would
kind of really love to talk.

395
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,301
Kid, I'm Bacchus.

396
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,542
I am the god of not being
a wiggly, little anxious

397
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,018
wet dish rag that would kind
of really love to talk to you,

398
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,580
so I need you to unclench
your vagina and do that shot

399
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,422
or I'm moving on.

400
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,493
Just a little sexist.

401
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,929
Five, four, three, two...

402
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,966
Attaboy.

403
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,594
Okay, what do you wanna do now?

404
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,935
Twister? You wanna
pierce something?

405
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:51,569
Oh, I've got Trivial
Pursuit Star Trek edition.

406
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,468
Just... Mr. Bacchus, we...

407
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,572
Magic, and how
it's completely gone.

408
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,248
Magic is gone
for you little guys?

409
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,845
You don't say.

410
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,651
What is... All over the U.S.?

411
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,419
All over everywhere, we think.

412
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,792
Oh, I've been a
little out of touch.

413
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,132
Well, that sucks for you.

414
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,292
Why?

415
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,958
Well...

416
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,698
I, um...

417
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,339
Sort of killed a god.

418
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,305
A minor... Like, a
very, you know...

419
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,899
We had to. A minor god.

420
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,288
Not because we wanted to,
but just because we had to.

421
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,371
You understand... Who?

422
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,373
Who the fuck did you kill?

423
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,243
Um, Ember in...

424
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,187
Fillory?

425
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,390
I don't know that guy.

426
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,259
Deserved it. I...

427
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,031
Oh!

428
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,202
Tough choices make a man, man.
- Yeah.

429
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,330
Open your mouth.

430
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,498
Sorry?

431
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,405
Like, open your mouth.

432
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,639
Ahh.

433
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,411
Happy birthday.

434
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,176
Okay, so this is gonna be

435
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,742
a little bit more challenging
than we expected.

436
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,514
What did you put in my mouth?

437
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,143
Alice? Where are you going?

438
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,976
I can't do this. I can't
study dead magic.

439
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,447
I can't...

440
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,984
Can we just go sit down
somewhere and talk, please?

441
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,951
Stop. Look, here's the deal.

442
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,920
I thought if we hung
out, maybe had sex,

443
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,220
I don't know, went to
school, it would feel like it did.

444
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,386
I thought I could
forgive you, but I can't.

445
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,894
I just...

446
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,124
Say good-bye and let me go.

447
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,623
Good-bye, Alice.

448
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,168
Alice?

449
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,764
Nope.

450
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you okay?

451
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,093
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

452
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,272
Hey.

453
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,976
Sorry.

454
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,608
I am so... No, it's...

455
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,209
Very... Me too.

456
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,446
Very high.

457
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,455
I get it.

458
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,921
Does your high ever turn on
you and you go from happy to

459
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,864
remembering you live in a
barren world devoid of magic?

460
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,663
Mine more goes from okay to,

461
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,672
"Oh, yeah, you have PTSD
from being sexually assaulted

462
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,537
"by a trickster god."

463
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,110
Long story.

464
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,405
I got time.

465
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,378
Let's talk about something else.

466
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,543
Sure.

467
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,882
Sure, whatever you...

468
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,017
Hey, you ever, uh...

469
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,252
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,864
I just really loved doing magic.

471
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,960
And I was good at it.

472
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,796
You should have
tasted my tomatoes.

473
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,366
And just, the air
smelled different, right?

474
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,275
And I could turn into a
bird, or make a rose bloom.

475
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,877
And I saw actual Fillory.

476
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,916
And I banged a werewolf, yes.

477
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,248
That is weird, but also rad,
because who gets to do that?

478
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,514
And I wasn't just some
extremely average nobody.

479
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,923
I was gifted.

480
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,894
I didn't just belong somewhere.

481
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,524
I belonged anywhere
because I was a Magician.

482
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,402
I just...

483
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,833
I don't even know what
anything is even about anymore.

484
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,747
Maybe there's a
way to get it back.

485
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:30,016
Look, no offense, I've
been researching, and...

486
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,785
Stick a fork in it.

487
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,421
Please tell me you're not just
really, really good at smoke rings.

488
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,989
Mmm-mmm.

489
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,288
No, I can't even blow one.

490
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,488
How?

491
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,093
I don't know yet.

492
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,461
Julia.

493
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,465
Q!

494
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,505
Stop, Q, you're
giving me the spins...

495
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,272
Look, I know that
you're blasted, but...

496
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,345
You're blasted!

497
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,143
Yeah, but even I know that
you cannot show people that.

498
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,444
Why not?

499
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,994
Because if the wrong
people found out...

500
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,180
He is not the wrong people.

501
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,849
I can't go through the rest of
my life just not trusting anyone.

502
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,289
I feel fucked up enough.

503
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,619
I get that.

504
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,722
Just put yourself in my
shoes just for one second, Q.

505
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,664
I have magic.

506
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,635
And what does it do?

507
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,897
More or less jack shit.

508
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:56,442
And I see someone whose entire
life would change if he could just see it.

509
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,737
I have to be able to
do something with it.

510
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,180
And if that's cheer up Josh
Hoberman, then I'll take it.

511
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,149
Because I can't... You know,

512
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,710
I can't be so precious with
something that is so small.

513
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,448
It's not small, it's the...

514
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,158
It's the biggest magic, Jules.

515
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,320
'Cause as far as we know,

516
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,991
for us little guys, it's
the only magic out there.

517
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,074
Ow! What... Ow!

518
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,885
Dude, you're gonna leave
a mark and I don't like that

519
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,343
in a non-sexual context.

520
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:35,006
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Um...

521
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,611
You watched <i>Battlestar</i>, right?

522
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,845
Yeah, I love when they
do terrorism allegory

523
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,182
with mostly white people.

524
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,620
Hmm. You remember
Grace Park in season one?

525
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,850
Of course, best storyline.

526
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,086
Why? Duh... Because
she was actually...

527
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,252
You're Grace Park.

528
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,522
Okay?

529
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,064
You're Grace Park, Margo.

530
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,268
I'm Grace Park. Yeah.

531
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,742
And we have ourselves a bit of a...
Gene Hackman in <i>The Conversation.</i>

532
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,038
I didn't see that one.

533
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,442
Yeah, right... Um...

534
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,510
Someone is "xoxo,
Gossip Girl"-ing our shit.

535
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,120
Remember James
Marsden in <i>X-Men?</i> Hmm?

536
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:21,059
Your Marsden is xoxo-ing us full
on that great song by The Police.

537
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,993
That Fairuza Balk in <i>The Craft.</i>

538
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,390
Yeah, more Cersei Lannister.

539
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,560
Hey, glad I made you read those.

540
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,238
Well, I read the Wiki.

541
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,207
What? Those books are
like a million pages long.

542
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,607
I have a life. Okay.

543
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:42,239
Anyway, whatever your Marsden
would xoxo, Cersei xoxo's.

544
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,079
So, we have to keep it
very best episode of <i>Buffy.</i>

545
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,150
Oh, musical?

546
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,652
The other one. Okay.

547
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:53,252
How do we Lizzie Borden
the shit out of this thing?

548
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:57,695
'Cause I am about
ready to go full '07 Britney.

549
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,863
Maybe we could've back
when this place was Pottered up.

550
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,094
Still.

551
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,764
Even without a wand, Harry
would figure some shit out.

552
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,042
Honestly, I didn't quite
finish those books either...

553
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,771
Our Harry, I mean.

554
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,938
Oh! Him.

555
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,114
Well, he'd...

556
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:19,977
Mmm-hmm?

557
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,715
Consult the creepy pedophile.

558
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,460
We're close, I think.

559
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,665
I thought this excursion was
mostly about drinking heavily.

560
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,468
I needed to imply that

561
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,670
so we could get away
without extra eyes on us.

562
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,071
Fairies, Tick.

563
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,973
When magic died, they pounced.

564
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,678
Full occupation.

565
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,017
This explains so much.

566
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,785
What will we do?

567
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,063
The White Lady was
spotted somewhere near here.

568
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,533
We're going to shoot her,

569
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:14,003
and then we're going to wish
those fairies to the fucking cornfield.

570
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,563
Oh, excellent.

571
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,008
Whatever a cornfield is.

572
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:31,189
Oh! Oh, there he is!

573
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,357
Man... Or, god, I just...

574
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,692
Look, I thank you.

575
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,699
I just... I feel... You know,
whatever you put in my mouth...

576
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,598
I just... I feel like...

577
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,297
You know, like a sugary
cereal in the good way.

578
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,375
You know? It's like, whoa!

579
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,534
All right.

580
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,108
Hey, hey, shots, right?

581
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,112
Shots, shots, shots, shots.

582
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,079
You and me. Shots, shots.

583
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,617
I love you, I love you.

584
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,982
<i>I'm falling on my knees</i>

585
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,545
<i>In worship of you</i>

586
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,593
Yeah.

587
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,594
Look, so, anyway, I was
thinking, while we're here,

588
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,459
maybe I could ask
you a few questions.

589
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,564
Dude.

590
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,594
You're a vibe-killer.

591
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,963
No. Yes, you are.

592
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,936
And historically, I
do smite vibe-killers.

593
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,598
No, look, I'm a vibe-supporter.

594
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,437
I just also happen to be a
concerned Magician individual

595
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,503
who would like to get a
word in with your parents.

596
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
My parents?

597
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,640
Yeah, the old gods.

598
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:40,416
Are imperious and distant dickwads
who I haven't spoken to in a millennia.

599
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,020
Rambo!

600
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,957
Let's get that foam
gun loaded, baby.

601
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,429
Look, I know that this
really wasn't on your radar

602
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,905
until you met us, but we've
lost our most precious resource.

603
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,901
Dude, stop, okay?

604
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,002
If fixing magic is, like,
so important to you,

605
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,909
then you should just
talk to this crazy guy

606
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,573
that I met back in
Athens one time.

607
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,015
Rambo! Rambo!

608
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,117
What was the name of
that guy that I met in Athens,

609
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,985
that up-with-humans guy?

610
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,182
Fit bod.

611
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,313
You mean Prometheus?

612
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,483
Prom...

613
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:17,222
That guy loved Magicians,
and he would want to help you.

614
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,329
He's dead.

615
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,523
What?

616
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:23,157
Prometheus died, like,
1,500 years ago, man.

617
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,792
Sorry.

618
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,466
Damn it.

619
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,408
Well, he lived a pretty
tortured existence,

620
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,537
so, dying was
probably a relief for him.

621
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,772
Ahem.

622
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,180
But, still, he
would've helped you.

623
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,819
He told me this crazy story
one time about how there's like...

624
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,019
Like, a secret
back door to magic.

625
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,523
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

626
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,691
I don't remember the deets,
okay, my face was melting off.

627
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,792
Secret back door.

628
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,599
Just, something...

629
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,831
Mmm-hmm.

630
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,506
Wait!

631
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,436
Might've been a brothel.

632
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,904
Shots.

633
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,047
Tick?

634
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,384
Tick?

635
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,757
Shit.

636
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,011
Not the best idea, Eliot.

637
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,311
I was looking for
the White Lady.

638
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,580
Is this she?

639
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:01,264
Look, if you don't come out of
there, I'm going to have to shoot you.

640
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,098
Gods! Have you never
given a compliment?

641
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,934
For example, my,
my, High King Eliot.

642
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,033
Your long legs look so
well in those breeches.

643
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,913
Thank you.

644
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,441
Your turn.

645
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,510
You sound like a...

646
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,821
Very attractive Creature.

647
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,216
You think so?

648
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:31,355
I've met many non-humans,
and your voice is by far the...

649
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,796
Sexiest.

650
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:33,921
Really?

651
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,331
I mean, you sound noble.

652
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,296
I didn't mean...

653
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:44,276
You're wise, for I am,
indeed, the sexiest in the land.

654
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,677
It is I, the Great Cock
of The Darkling Woods.

655
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,975
The Great...

656
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,016
Cock.

657
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,449
Have you never beheld
one, child of Earth?

658
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,851
No, no.

659
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,946
No, I've beheld one or two.

660
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,658
But you are, by far,
the most majestic.

661
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,160
I'm diligent about hydration.

662
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,857
All right,
petitioner, let's chat.

663
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,587
I like your style.

664
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,495
What is the point of hearing a
petition if the aesthetics are shit?

665
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,399
I need help with a fairy thing.

666
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:51,203
Tribal matriarchies
are the absolute worst.

667
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:58,239
So, I was just hoping in your
great, benevolent handsomeness

668
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:01,510
that you would see fit to
grant me just one little wish.

669
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,715
That's the sort of thing my sister,
The Winter's Doe, specializes in.

670
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,691
Also, when was the last
time a petitioner didn't get

671
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,593
utterly assfucked
by a wish-granting?

672
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,788
Yeah.

673
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,530
And yet...

674
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,067
I'll do you better.

675
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,568
There's a problem
far greater than fairies.

676
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,935
Solve it, they're nothing.

677
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,807
I'll send you on an epic quest.

678
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,570
That's...

679
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,076
Uh...

680
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,582
Wow, that's great. Thank you.

681
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,743
It's just...

682
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,913
My people need help.

683
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,923
They sure do. Today.

684
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,084
The Fairy Queen is sitting
on my throne as we speak.

685
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,058
Do you want your
magic back or not?

686
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,892
Will it not solve
all your problems?

687
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:48,798
I mean, yes, but, it's just...

688
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,131
How long does a
quest like this take?

689
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,137
A good season.

690
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,365
Right.

691
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,601
My kingdom is in trouble now.

692
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,138
You are a good king.

693
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:05,281
But it is time to
become a great one.

694
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,615
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

695
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:15,092
where you are no king, no
Magician, just a vulnerable man.

696
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:20,792
Honestly, that sounds like
something I might really fuck up.

697
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,801
Yes, or it wouldn't be a quest.

698
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,468
You have friends, don't you?

699
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,940
I used to.

700
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,472
The one-eyed conqueror,
the traveler, the warrior,

701
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,314
the fool, the god-touched,
the lover of tomatoes,

702
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,411
and the torture artist...

703
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,888
Wait, which one is that?

704
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,719
You lost me there. Nevermind.

705
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,762
You have a brother of the
heart with the foppy hair.

706
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,829
That would be Quentin.

707
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,592
You're parts of one whole.

708
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,225
No one can do this alone.

709
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,825
Okay.

710
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,838
FYI, I can't contact them
or reach them in any way.

711
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,000
You must find the
book with no author.

712
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,670
A tale for children,
but they're hardly that.

713
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:11,079
There is the key... Or, the
keys... In a place called...

714
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,712
Public Library.

715
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:20,251
In the shire of Chester
in the land of New Jersey.

716
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,020
Again, that sure
sounds like Earth.

717
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:26,793
Eliot, the quest I bestow on
you is the task you were born for.

718
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,265
Claim it.

719
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,705
Abigail, talking-animal
question.

720
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,407
So, bunnies.

721
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,942
Her Sluggishness has
noted that you are aware

722
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,385
of their messenger abilities.

723
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,389
So, that is what the Fairy
Queen uses them for?

724
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,517
Bunnies move easily
between worlds.

725
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,555
And do they serve her?

726
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,894
And if so, how loyally?

727
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,230
Every bunny for itself, Majesty.

728
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,898
Thank you.

729
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,282
Need help.

730
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:22,911
Love, Eliot.

731
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,535
Q.

732
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,465
I think this is it.

733
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,969
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

734
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,276
No author, I mean, I can
feel something coming off of it.

735
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,019
Interesting.

736
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,132
Interesting.

737
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:21,669
Yeah, if by interesting,
you mean, blank, sure.

738
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,680
Quests never give away the farm.

739
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,273
You've gotta earn everything.

740
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,981
Jules, this is our quest.

741
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,750
And we're already on it.

742
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,086
Epic quest. We have to.

743
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,439
Map from the
book. Work together.

744
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,658
Also I think... Eliot.

745
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,289
Epic Quest. The Great Cock.

746
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,562
It's called After
Island. A back door to...

747
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,829
The Great Cock. Epic quest.

748
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,165
Keys. Here's the deal.

749
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,229
Epic quest. All seven keys.

750
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,241
Here's the deal. Epic quest.

751
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,210
Just shush for one
second, please.

752
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,185
Uh, that one.

753
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,481
Put him first.

754
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,484
Your father and I
are so proud of you.

755
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,663
Okay...

756
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,264
We are go for epic quest.

757
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,863
You are indeed a brave king.

758
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,965
I am indeed a guy with not much
choice, but thanks for rounding up.

759
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,277
We're looking for keys.

760
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,837
Q and Julia believe
whatever the keys unlock,

761
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,907
will help restore magic.

762
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:36,215
And they think the first
key is here in Fillory.

763
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,885
Excellent.

764
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,356
Some place called After Island?

765
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,688
Oh.

766
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:46,089
It lies beyond our
border, Majesty.

767
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,998
You would be venturing to
strange lands not your own.

768
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,162
So, not the friendliest?

769
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:57,197
It is said that even the Outer
Sea itself wishes ill upon our king.

770
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,834
Some have sailed before you...

771
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,378
And how'd that go?

772
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,606
They drowned.

773
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,177
Oh.

774
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:07,050
Well, how do we prevent that?

775
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,609
I wish I knew, I only...

776
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,948
I know.

777
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,424
I know exactly
the boat you need.

778
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,971
Okay! That's enough.

779
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,600
Let's talk.

780
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,780
So transactional.

781
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,947
What do you want
with a Lamprey anyway?

782
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,213
It's more what the
Lamprey wants with me.

783
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,754
Oh, shit.

784
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,619
You poked the wrong
bear, sweetness.

785
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,522
Just tell me what you know.

786
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:49,485
Please?

787
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:50,637
Well, if you could do magic...

788
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,129
Yeah, well, I can't.

789
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,356
So...

790
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,834
So, you're down to an
early warning device.

791
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,426
An alarm, if you will.

792
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:03,703
So, just maybe, you
still got time to run.

793
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,308
Okay, fine, I'll take it.

794
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,346
What, is that a joke?

795
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,176
I gave up jokes 80 years ago.

796
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,449
Tired of being misunderstood.

797
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,786
So get one, and keep it
on your person at all times.

798
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,490
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

799
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:29,561
Ah.

800
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,880
Just a side of bacon, please.
