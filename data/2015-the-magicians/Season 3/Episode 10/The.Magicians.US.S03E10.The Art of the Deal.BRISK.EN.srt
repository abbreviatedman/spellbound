1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,540
Previously on The Magicians...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,739
I'm a librarian.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,519
Currently on the lam from
a billion year contract.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,140
- Sylvia, what'd you do?
- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,860
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,290
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm stuck in the Fairy
Realm. How can I see you?

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,960
Let's you see into other
worlds, it's rad.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,670
You're the absolute worst rulers

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,470
Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
Honey, you don't have to listen to Tick.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,700
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,840
Turn around, head home, relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,650
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,180
This magic.

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,550
I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,920
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,550
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,720
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,560
to snort so they can do magic tricks.

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,630
I wanna help you get out of here.

22
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,460
The necklace.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,960
It kills them when they use magic.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,819
So you're just okay with letting Kady

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,230
- take the Fifth Key, huh?
- I'm not letting her do anything.

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,690
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,099
Hey, Kady, I...

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,330
Please leave a message at the tone.

29
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,480
Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,250
Look, she probably took it because...

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,330
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

32
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,820
At least I know what Kady wants.

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,490
What does that mean?

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,760
She wants to talk to Penny.

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,340
But you, I don't...

36
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,360
First, you don't wanna
help us with the Quest.

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,360
Then, suddenly, you want magic so badly

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,090
- that you nearly kill yourself.
- That's not fair.

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,230
None of that is fair.

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,700
Okay, well, then what is it?

41
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,040
Do you...

42
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,130
Are you with us? Do you want magic back?

43
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,610
Of course I want magic.

44
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,510
Okay, well, then what changed?

45
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,180
Why now?

46
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,020
As opposed to when, huh?

47
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,349
When you asked me if I
wanted to go on a Quest

48
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,820
five minutes after my dad died?

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,530
Would you be ready to go
on a fucking adventure?

50
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,970
- Alice, I'm just...
- You know, and are you

51
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,430
the only one who's allowed to be

52
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,530
ambivalent and depressive and...

53
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,380
And scared and hate themselves?

54
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,700
But I just have to be
sure of everything, huh?

55
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,400
Fuck you, Quentin.

56
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,540
Uh, s... sorry.

57
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,580
I was just trying to get through.

58
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,710
Sorry.

59
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,480
We can fight about this after the Quest.

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,870
Just let me see the stupid book.

61
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,850
Whoa.

62
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,970
There's something she's not telling me.

63
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,900
You really think it was a good idea

64
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,580
to give her the book?

65
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,080
I don't know.

66
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,940
She helped us with the last key.

67
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,120
And we're probably gonna need

68
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,110
her for the next one, so...

69
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,740
The book says that the Sixth Key is

70
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,710
in the Throne Room at Whitespire.

71
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,150
Oh, shit.

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,940
Wait, that's where Margo and Eliot...

73
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,370
Just got overthrown violently? Yeah.

74
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,480
Oh.

75
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,160
I need an aspirin.

76
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,320
Whoa.

77
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,300
Thank you.

78
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,440
I'll never take magic for granted again.

79
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,900
Yeah.

80
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,650
Me neither.

81
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,910
Uh, look,

82
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,060
there's something I have to

83
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,310
finish here before I can leave.

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,480
I can't go knowing that
the fairies are...

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,780
Jules, do what you gotta do.

86
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,790
- Just be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,180
You too.

88
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,619
Okay, so Skye's telling

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,530
the others what happened to her.

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,090
And that we wanna help them escape.

91
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,850
But that can't happen until

92
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,770
we get their necklaces off.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,930
Oh.

94
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,530
There's an emoji of a dagger.

95
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,120
Todd was right, this truly
is the universal language.

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,140
I need you to focus.

97
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,110
I can't find anything
on these necklaces,

98
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,670
and I need to know how they work.

99
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,780
Can't you see I'm busy?

100
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,280
Fen.

101
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,970
Look, I know what the fairies did

102
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,690
to you in Fillory was fucked up.

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,620
And I'm sorry about that, but...

104
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,020
Yeah...

105
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,330
That's my response.

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,170
Is that a gif of a crab with a knife?

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,630
It's how I feel.

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,730
Is it "gif" or "jif?"

109
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,870
Please. I need your help.

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,290
Fairies just make my skin crawl.

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,870
Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

112
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,049
So what you're saying is that

113
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,920
you want a fairy necklace

114
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,920
- to examine?
- Yes.

115
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,650
One that isn't already
attached to a fairy's neck.

116
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,990
Fine, but don't expect me to pretend

117
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,270
like I don't hate fairies.

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,680
You don't have to.

119
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,080
We know about your fairies.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,100
There's one standing right there.

121
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,770
Fen's family had a problem with them,

122
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,540
so I'm trying to help fix it.

123
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,670
I hate them. Their black eyes.

124
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,340
Their long fingers. Their mushrooms.

125
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,710
Mushrooms?

126
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,180
They make the air thick and musty,

127
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,020
like a bear's undercarriage.

128
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,399
And what was the deal that

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,960
you made with these fairies?

130
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,530
Oh, I didn't make a deal.

131
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,589
- One was made for me by...
- By her family.

132
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,620
See, uh, they were tricked.

133
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,560
Interesting.

134
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,030
And here I thought that the
fairies under my protection

135
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,560
were the last of their kind.

136
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
I wish.

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,630
- They're everywhere in Fil...
- Fillmore.

138
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,070
Fillmore.

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,700
It's, um... it's a small
farming town in the Midwest.

140
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,970
And what about you, Julia?

141
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,370
How is it that you can see them?

142
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,910
I made a deal with a younger fairy.

143
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,890
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

144
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,910
And just how young was this fairy?

145
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,880
I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

146
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,310
Which... which is why
we wanted to ask you,

147
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,680
how are the ones here,

148
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,400
you know, so docile?

149
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,890
Well, I assume that
you've noticed that, uh,

150
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,900
all of my fairies have
this silver collar.

151
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,070
You mean, their necklace?

152
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,670
Necklaces, yeah.

153
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,900
They are cute, aren't they?

154
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,340
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

155
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,800
You'll need one.

156
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,650
You can get it from my Uncle Edwin.

157
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,140
But I'm gonna need something in return.

158
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,110
Of course. If your rash is back...

159
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,780
I'll need you to bring me a fairy.

161
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,950
Penny, during orientation,

162
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,450
weren't you trained on how
to properly re-shelve?

163
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,220
We got a billion years, Howard.

164
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,290
Just keeping shit interesting.

165
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,360
So, uh, Penny.

166
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,660
My book club is looking for new members.

167
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,170
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

168
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,410
Why?

169
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,340
'Cause I'm brown?

170
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,300
And shackled?

171
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,140
You know this looks bad
for the Library, right?

172
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,680
Oh, no. We are not...

173
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,880
We shackle people of all
races and colors here.

174
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,710
Not better, Howard.

175
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,480
What I meant was...

176
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,250
- I read your book.
- The hell?

177
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,580
I had unresolved feelings about my death

178
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,920
and your hand in it.

179
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,220
You killed yourself.

180
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,190
Am I misremembering the
part where you handed me

181
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,890
the cursed book that
directly led to that?

182
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,830
So the least you can do
is join my book club.

183
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,350
Kathy always brings cupcakes.

184
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,020
- They're amazing.
- Fuck off, Howard.

185
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,840
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

186
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,540
Give it a think.

187
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,850
Fasten it around the
neck to activate it.

188
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,080
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

189
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,920
Should deter them from even trying.

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,630
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

191
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,860
Oh, I'm sure I'll figure something out.

192
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,260
So, how does it work?

193
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,780
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's...

194
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,520
That would be a family secret.

195
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,290
Okay. Uh, but...

196
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,140
once it's on, how will
I know it's secure?

197
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,870
Has a fairy ever broken out of one?

198
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,310
Dust.

199
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,210
This is Dust.

200
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,380
I've had him since I was 16.

201
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,820
But he's been in the family much longer.

202
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,260
How long?

203
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,510
Over 400 years, sir.

204
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,249
He may not look it,

205
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,389
but he's our oldest Fairy.

206
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,860
Tell Irene her guest has a collar.

207
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes, sir.

208
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,240
There's really only one
way to take them off.

209
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,800
I have a machine that does it.

210
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,270
So don't worry, they're secure.

211
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,080
Great.

212
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,580
Thank you so much for all your help.

213
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,430
- Today is not my day.
- I get that you're mad, okay?

214
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,210
- But just hear me out.
- You turned me in, Sylvia.

215
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,790
Look, when magic went out,

216
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,720
shit got really bad up
there for my family, okay?

217
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,100
My... my brothers, my...
my uncles, my dad,

218
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,430
- they all got whacked.
- And went where?

219
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,540
To the Underworld? Where you are?

220
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,980
All my people are up there, Sylvia.

221
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,370
I can't travel, I can't astral project,

222
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,599
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

223
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,610
My family isn't in the
Underworld, Penny.

224
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,270
They moved on.

225
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,510
To where?

226
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,290
I mean, I'm not sure.

227
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,290
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

228
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,890
You hang around for a bit, and then

229
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,360
the bureaucracies that be move you on.

230
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,420
But I don't know what or where that is.

231
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,400
So your family just left you?

232
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,170
Yeah, Dad's always sucked at waiting,

233
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,840
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

234
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,470
But these contracts that
we sign with the Library

235
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,370
are fucking ironclad,

236
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,850
so I can't go anywhere

237
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,980
until I finish my billion years.

238
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,480
When the Library put a bounty on you,

239
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,169
it brought me a million years

240
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,040
closer to my family, Penny.

241
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,360
And I'm sorry. I know that
that doesn't fix anything...

242
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,030
Yeah, you're right.

243
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,310
It fixes shit.

244
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,330
I spoke to a few of the others.

245
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,870
They don't believe me.

246
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,240
If I hadn't done the magic,

247
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,340
if I hadn't felt what happened,

248
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I don't think I would believe me either.

249
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,680
Okay, Skye.

250
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,109
You've got to keep trying.

251
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,250
How? What should I say?

252
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,140
Look, I don't know,

253
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,780
but I found a way to
take off the collars.

254
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,589
Edwin's got a machine in the Lab.

255
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,090
It won't matter. They're scared.

256
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,360
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

257
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,819
But...

258
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,990
There is one more thing.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,760
Several of Ms. Irene's
family have arrived.

260
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,629
Many of them brought their fairies.

261
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,350
To Brakebills?

262
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,040
Why?

263
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,240
I don't know.

264
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,410
Skye.

265
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,710
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,710
It's okay.

267
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,050
If Skye can't convince them

268
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,730
to run, what are we gonna do?

269
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,260
We introduce them to someone scarier.

270
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm on a flying boat!

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,230
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

272
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,230
Where Tick's waiting
with a serrated spoon

273
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,070
to just saw off our heads?

274
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,780
Tick isn't at Whitespire, though.

275
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,310
He's up north, near Loria.

276
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,980
The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

277
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,610
So the book says that the Sixth Key

278
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,250
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half moons,

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,950
which is a thing that
happens in Fillory.

280
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,580
Like two black and white
cookies split apart

281
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,130
to form one giant white cookie.

282
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,490
A cookie moon.

283
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,000
Mm-hmm.

284
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,030
Uh, anyway,

285
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,869
so it... it's gonna be super bright,

286
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,330
um, and it happens tonight, so...

287
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,630
Wait, why is Tick up near Loria?

288
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,270
- Fillory's at war.
- What?

289
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,470
The fuck?

290
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,170
I know, we are literally Questing

291
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,040
through a war-torn country.

292
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,370
So epic.

293
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,640
And who exactly are we at war with?

294
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,380
The Lorians and the Floaters.

295
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,449
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

296
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,479
That cock's High King for three seconds

297
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,280
- and it all goes to shit.
- I need to send a Bunny to Idri.

298
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,290
Yeah, I'll send one to that Stone bitch.

299
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,939
Wait, what about the key?

300
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,560
Q, you just told us,

301
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,560
Fillory is being spit-roasted
by invading forces.

302
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,030
Without us.

303
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,800
Okay, can I say something obvious,

304
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,670
yet potentially controversial?

305
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,240
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

306
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,470
Says who?

307
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,570
Fillory, when they overthrew you.

308
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,540
- Mm...
- Well, they were misguided,

309
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,640
and scared, and they needed scapegoats.

310
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,440
At some point, you either have

311
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,830
to choose to follow through

312
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,680
on something, or just,

313
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,170
well,

314
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,670
die.

315
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,020
Look, we chose this.

316
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,320
You captain the Key Quest, Coldwater,

317
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
and we'll stop war.

318
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,190
Ooh, ooh, can you drop
us off at Whitespire

319
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,340
after it gets dark?

320
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,729
They have that balcony.

321
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,500
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

322
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,430
It would be dope.

323
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,500
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,

324
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,800
'cause this boat don't
do complete stops.

325
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,039
Yes, once fairies lived on Earth.

326
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,440
But not in hundreds of years.

327
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,399
Not since we fled to Fillory

328
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,700
because human Magicians

329
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,680
nearly hunted us into extinction.

330
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,250
I had no idea.

331
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,190
Of course not.

332
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,390
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

333
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,190
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,530
So you'll understand my disbelief then

335
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,430
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

336
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,999
with tales of a lost
tribe that can't exist.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,700
- But they're not...
- I've heard enough.

338
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,050
Wait.

339
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,990
You're not listening.

340
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,220
I'd rather remove your tongue.

341
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,330
Maybe your teeth.

342
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,860
- You choose.
- Go ahead.

343
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,170
You have already taken so much from me.

344
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,870
What's a few teeth?

345
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,410
You've got two sentences.

346
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,370
Choose wisely.

347
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,510
I hate fairies.

348
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,630
So why would I come here,

349
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,190
to a place where you stole my toes

350
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,730
and I lost my child, if it wasn't true?

351
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,190
Then why would you do this for me?

352
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,360
It's not for you.

353
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,160
- It's for them.
- They're still fairies.

354
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,900
But they're nothing like you.

355
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,330
They're more like traumatized children.

356
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,170
And as a mother, despite
what you did to me,

357
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,190
they deserve a chance to live.

358
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,450
So get off your...

359
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,140
Whatever it is fairies
have for rear butts,

360
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,080
and do something.

361
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,330
They need their Queen.

362
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,070
What part of the Library

363
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,250
is "Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

364
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,070
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

365
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,440
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

366
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,000
Uh, it's some weird

367
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,260
research division

368
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,620
that the Library made in
partnership with the people

369
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,740
who run the Underworld.

370
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,860
Librarians like us aren't
even allowed to go in there.

371
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,390
What the hell do they
do to these people?

372
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,960
Oh, it's like primal therapy

373
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,500
for people who are about to move on.

374
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,300
You go and unload your bullshit

375
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,600
and it lightens your conscience.

376
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm sure my dad's was a nightmare.

377
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,470
This is all part of that

378
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,140
"Underworld is a way station" shit?

379
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,970
Yeah, they, like, jot
down everything of note,

380
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,140
and then at the end you get
a metro card out of here.

381
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,800
You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

382
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,360
Well, it's more like this giant, long,

383
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,280
pig-type creature that
you, like, climb into,

384
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,290
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

385
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,120
Why the hell are we still here?

386
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
Why haven't we hijacked that long pig?

387
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,359
Because it only shows
up when somebody has

388
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,330
a metro card and is ready to move on.

389
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,130
Our contracts will never let us move on.

390
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,440
Nobody's ever gonna give
us metro cards, Penny.

391
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,640
Not like them.

392
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,280
Okay, so in this chapter

393
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,280
the Daughter, she finally
becomes the Knight

394
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,280
that she set out to be, and
right after she's knighted,

395
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,390
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back.

396
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,490
- What're you doing?
- Guys, guys.

397
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,190
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

398
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,040
The book says the moonlight has to hit

399
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,830
three keystones to reveal the key.

400
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,570
There's three doors, three keystones,

401
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
and none of them are near a window.

402
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,470
Okay, so we set up some mirrors,

403
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,170
and bounce around some moonlight,

404
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,410
and then we're back on track?
Enjoying the Quest?

405
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,860
- Yeah, if that's what the book says.
- Ou know it does.

406
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,839
Hey.

407
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,180
Look, it's a perfect metaphor
for your relationship.

408
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,980
Not ready to laugh...

409
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,250
Yet, that's fine.

410
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,770
You want me to put on a slave collar?

411
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,250
It's the only way we can get you

412
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,849
in direct contact with Irene's fairies.

413
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,460
Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

414
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,860
For all we know, the McAllistairs

415
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,700
can trigger the collars remotely.

416
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,230
And just like that...

417
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,440
Every collared fairy will be dead.

418
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,070
We need to be stealth. Smart.

419
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,480
Tell me,

420
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,139
what's smart about rendering
myself defenseless

421
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,230
and then entrusting my life

422
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,250
to a powerless Magician?

423
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,630
You're god-touched.

424
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,040
That's one way to put it.

425
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,110
But it also means I can protect you.

426
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,280
It doesn't mean that I trust you.

427
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,310
I get it. For good reason.

428
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,580
Why would you trust any human on Earth?

429
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,490
But Fen and I are risking our lives.

430
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,150
So we need you to trust us.

431
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,720
Or don't.

432
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,190
And we can just do this on our own.

433
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,990
Without you.

434
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,340
She's right.

435
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,660
I'm not sure how, but
we will find a way.

436
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,430
What is it that you want from us?

437
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,340
Not sure I understand.

438
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,330
She's healing a mother's
wound, but you...

439
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,909
Why go so far, Julia?

440
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,460
Let's just say being
god-touched is a mixed bag.

441
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,320
But I choose to do something with that.

442
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,280
It means something.

443
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,929
Helping those fairies,

444
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,520
saving them, with you.

445
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,160
And this collar.

446
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,040
This had better work.

447
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,300
She really is stunning.

448
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,230
How many more of them are there?

449
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,700
Hard to say, really.

450
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,450
They're not all that friendly.

451
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,010
And where did you say your
friend is from again?

452
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,200
- The Midwest.
- No, I mean what town is she...

453
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,660
Huh, excuse me.

454
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,220
Fairly well-behaved, actually,

455
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,050
considering she's feral.

456
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,990
Guess I got lucky, huh?

457
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,990
Uh, that's a much faster

458
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,530
turnaround than we agreed on.

459
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,750
You know what, it'll be a push,

460
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,270
but I think I can get
it to you all by then.

461
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,200
The others will take some convincing...

462
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,710
Looks like we're working through dinner.

463
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,660
You know what to do with her.

464
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,500
... especially if time is against us.

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,410
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

466
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,210
But we'll talk later?

467
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,080
About the other fairies?

468
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
Of course.

469
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,360
_

470
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,000
- _
- Shit.

471
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,960
It's true.

472
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,630
What Julia said.

473
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
You're real.

474
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,560
You're a queen.

475
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,710
She's a queen.

476
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,150
Of the free fairies.

477
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,320
Never bow your head.

478
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,970
For anyone.

479
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,670
Collar breaker, collar breaker,

480
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,670
where are you?

481
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,120
- Ready the chair.
- I need to check the equipment.

482
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,620
Yes, sir.

483
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,670
They're saying they want everything.

484
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,940
Our entire supply.

485
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,740
Look, I know that it sounds risky,

486
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,210
but there is a limited
time to this offer.

487
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,320
- If we don't...
- Risky? No.

488
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,620
Reckless. Leave us.

489
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,880
Though we've been separated

490
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,490
by time and great distance,

491
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,660
we are the same.

492
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,430
We are spun from divine inspiration.

493
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,160
Blessed.

494
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,100
We are the living embodiment of magic.

495
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,770
I may have secured a new source.

496
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,600
Of fairies? How?

497
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,570
Ask Edwin. He's seen her.

498
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,340
So I've come to restore your strength.

499
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,020
To help you understand

500
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,130
the glory of who you are.

501
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,530
Your suffering is my suffering.

502
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,260
Your injustice, mine.

503
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,080
- Where is Edwin?
- Edwin?

504
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,090
Edwin is working.

505
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,640
And when we are finally free,

506
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,210
we are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

507
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,280
gouge out their eyes,

508
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,780
cut out their tongues,

509
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,570
and hang them by their own entrails.

510
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,260
You may feel a pinch, but if you relax,

511
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,960
it'll be brief.

512
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,830
You want us to pull back our
advancements on Fillory?

513
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,239
This is ridiculous.

514
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,100
All we're really asking is
that we pause the invasion.

515
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,670
You both know that the only
reason Eliot and I are

516
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,740
in this mess is because of
fairy meddling bullshit.

517
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,840
And as soon as we clear this up
with the people of Fillory...

518
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,610
Deposed rulers don't get
their thrones back.

519
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,140
They exile themselves.

520
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,840
Or die at the hands of the mob.

521
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,950
Is this how you talk to all your allies?

522
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,680
Allies?

523
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,950
My dear, I have yet to see
any proof that your marriage

524
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,750
to my son was ever even consummated.

525
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,530
I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

526
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,670
Are you sure that wasn't
from the toad bite?

527
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,030
You saw it?

528
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,960
Of course I did. I'm his mother.

529
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,500
Wow, that's a lot to process.

530
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,470
In any case, I have no
faith in either of you

531
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,140
reclaiming your thrones.

532
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,340
We will continue our
advancement on Fillory.

533
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,340
I'm afraid Loria declines as well.

534
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,310
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

535
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,980
It makes no sense to withdraw

536
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,020
when I know we'll succeed.

537
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,330
I have to do what's best for my people.

538
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,320
And what about our engagement?

539
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,640
You're no longer king, Eliot.

540
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,650
So it's no longer valid.

541
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,530
King Idri,

542
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,500
are you saying you have
yet to take a husband?

543
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,130
My son's marble has yet to be polished.

544
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,580
You mossy, pimping bitch.

545
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,010
Will you excuse us for two seconds?

546
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,390
As much as I would love

547
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
to roll your smother-in-law

548
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,749
off our boat, it won't prevent either

549
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,110
one of them from invading Fillory.

550
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,060
We need to split those
two up before your

551
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,930
man's arranged to marry my child bride.

552
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,380
And our best plan is...

553
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,160
We offer them magic.

554
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,730
What the...

555
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Fen!

556
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,930
I just watched him help kill a fairy.

557
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,770
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

558
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,680
just a machine that removes their heads.

559
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,060
What?

560
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,080
All right, we just need
to figure something out.

561
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,110
There's nothing.

562
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,050
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

563
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,950
Wait, the magic that
controls the collars,

564
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,490
they're fairy deals?

565
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,070
Edwin said you're the
oldest of the fairies.

566
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,890
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

567
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,800
Yes.

568
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,280
How could you do that

569
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,910
to your own people?

570
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,870
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

571
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,910
out of existence nearly.

572
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,410
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

573
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,260
Several of us volunteered

574
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,280
to bind ourselves to the collars

575
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,980
and the McAllistairs.

576
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,090
A deal that would keep
them from following.

577
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,280
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

578
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,420
But as my generation died,

579
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,830
and younger generations
were born into this life,

580
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,600
I lost faith in that sacrifice.

581
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,680
Or in the belief that my Queen

582
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,310
had made it to the other side.

583
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,920
She did.

584
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,470
My mother, your Queen,

585
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,660
led us to Fillory, where I was born.

586
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,960
And we were able to create a home there.

587
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,570
All because of your sacrifice.

588
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,290
You never should have come.

589
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,590
Because now you can never go back.

590
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,630
There is a way to break a
fairy deal, isn't there?

591
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,100
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

592
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,470
Of course it does.

593
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,680
I will not do it.

594
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,210
Our deals are the
foundation of our culture

595
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,180
and key to our survival.

596
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,590
You are their Queen.

597
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,439
You came here to save them.

598
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,860
If you don't, what's the point?

599
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,990
Fairies are known for
honoring their deals.

600
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,580
When we break them,

601
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,970
we lose the people's trust

602
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,779
and our limited leverage,

603
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,220
which we need for survival.

604
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,870
Without that, we are
weak and vulnerable.

605
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,140
It would be better for all of us

606
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,700
for me to take it to the grave.

607
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,540
Which will be soon enough!

608
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,210
Against the wall.

609
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,980
Dust, we're on a schedule.

610
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,090
Do not go with him.

611
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,030
What did I just say?

612
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,000
I won't let you do this.

613
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,460
I do not have time for this.

614
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,340
Stop! No!

615
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,030
What the fuck?

616
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,380
Ah!

617
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,550
You guarantee that this
is the best decision

618
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,290
- for our family?
- I guarantee it.

619
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,430
Do not make me regret
my decision, Irene.

620
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,970
Oh, Vincent, when have I ever

621
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,430
steered this family wrong?

622
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,500
Cheers.

623
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,230
- To us. To a new future.
- Cheers.

624
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,790
Oh.

625
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,140
Ahh!

626
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,720
Shit.

627
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,660
It seems like those Secrets

628
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,930
dicks really made you earn it.

629
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,810
Any idea where you're going

630
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,730
now that you're moving on?

631
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,930
No, they, uh... They didn't really say.

632
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,870
Well, who'd you talk to?

633
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,870
Was it Fran? Oh, she's...

634
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,240
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and...

635
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,150
Never really know which one to focus on

636
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,870
'cause they're both moving.

637
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,240
I... I had, uh...

638
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,210
I couldn't really see his
face under his hood,

639
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,880
but he had... He had glowing red eyes.

640
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,580
- Oh.
- What... what does that mean?

641
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,130
Oh, you must have done some

642
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,270
horrible shit in your time.

643
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,169
Wait, wait, uh, whe... where am I going?

644
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,960
Is it hell?

645
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,090
If only.

646
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,260
At least hell is warm.

647
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,600
There's a place worse than hell?

648
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,810
Oh, and way more creative
with what they plug

649
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,740
all of your openings up with.

650
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,569
I'm not ready.

651
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,650
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

652
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,220
Hello, Penny.

653
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,760
Let's chat.

654
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,400
I've missed this.

655
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,260
But it doesn't change anything.

656
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,770
You know what Margo's doing right now?

657
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
She's convincing the Stone Queen

658
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,770
that we'll get magic back.

659
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,270
Because we will.

660
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,669
And she's threatening her with it.

661
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:15,180
If I'm lying, invade later and kill me.

662
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,320
But if I'm not, do you
really wanna fight

663
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,809
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

664
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,690
your entire army into fucking compost?

665
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,719
And is that your strategy as well?

666
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,380
To threaten me?

667
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,110
I'd be well within my rights,

668
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,640
given that your army
is about to attack us.

669
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,800
But no, I'm not threatening you.

670
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,780
- I am promising you...
- What exactly?

671
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,260
On the off chance this is true,

672
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,960
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

673
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,300
Once we give back magic to the people,

674
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,890
we won't have to take anything.

675
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,939
Hell, they'll be begging us

676
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,340
to take back our thrones.

677
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,700
Our Magicians can identify

678
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,980
anyone with magical talent.

679
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,850
And it's likely that many
of your people have it

680
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,180
without the education to know it.

681
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,990
So we'll educate them.

682
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,400
Soon you could have magic

683
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,500
as powerful as ours.

684
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,930
I usually like to keep
a certain amount of

685
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,910
distance between myself
and the residents,

686
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,610
but you are just so fucking fascinating.

687
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,389
What?

688
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,150
I've never seen anyone fight
their destiny so hard

689
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,350
while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

690
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,790
I mean, you narrowly escaped death.

691
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,160
Twice.

692
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,060
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

693
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,490
Who does that?

694
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,530
Yeah, I still have no idea who you are.

695
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
Hades.

696
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,270
Hades.

697
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,900
- Like the god?
- Shh.

698
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,210
I told you, low profile.

699
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,380
Okay, so what the hell are
you doing talking to me?

700
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,590
- Look, is this about the metro...
- No, it's not about that.

701
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,080
It's much more big picture.

702
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,390
Let's talk about your
future as a Librarian.

703
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,920
Or not.

704
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,590
This is about that Quest, isn't it?

705
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,060
Let me tell you something about that.

706
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,650
It doesn't matter.

707
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,360
Easy for a god to say.

708
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,839
Spoiler alert...

709
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,540
Magic always comes back.

710
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,240
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

711
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,210
verging on the brink of
extinction, but it will.

712
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,410
Because ultimately,

713
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,419
magic's a carrot gods use

714
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,820
to keep humans in check.

715
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,320
It's a lot to take in, I know.

716
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,850
My point is, your life as a human,

717
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,260
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

718
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,130
This Quest, your friends,

719
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,090
in a thousand years,

720
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,360
hazy at best.

721
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,770
Your life starts now,

722
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,860
after death.

723
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,170
And yes, I realize the
phrasing is confusing.

724
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,410
Okay, what... what is this?

725
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,000
Is this some kind of fucked up

726
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,539
punishment for stealing a metro card?

727
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,110
Hardly. There are a lot of
places you could've ended up

728
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,780
that aren't nearly as
nice as the Underworld.

729
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,240
Shackled to a trolley re-shelving books?

730
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,120
We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

731
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,290
with almost an eternity to explore it.

732
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,790
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

733
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,280
So I have to join a book
club to free myself?

734
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,310
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

735
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,480
and be part of something.

736
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,850
You've got that whole loner thing,

737
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,820
but it's obviously a front.

738
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,660
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

739
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,630
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

740
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,130
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

741
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,160
that's read my book... what,
you just think you know me?

742
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,339
But it's why you're always sacrificing

743
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,840
yourself for people, right?

744
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,840
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

745
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,620
If you're that desperate to

746
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,380
move on and maybe somehow

747
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,299
fumble your way back to your old life,

748
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,600
I won't stop you.

749
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,380
But I'm telling you, Penny,

750
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,800
if you stay down here,

751
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,260
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

752
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,900
You've just gotta choose it first.

753
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,680
And that should be the
last keystone, right?

754
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,380
I don't understand.

755
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,870
Would you stop...

756
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,429
You keep acting like this is your book.

757
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,600
Maybe 'cause I've been on the Quest

758
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,000
for more than two minutes...

759
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,930
Guys, snoop-and-poop voices. Please.

760
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,340
You're hiding something from me.

761
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,110
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

762
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,270
Guys, seriously, I just got
out of a fantasy prison,

763
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,080
and I don't wanna end up in a real one.

764
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,160
Are you working for the Library?

765
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,670
Yes.

766
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,640
Surprisingly honest. That's...

767
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,620
Are you trying to stop us?

768
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,120
No.

769
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,240
They wanna help us. They want
magic back as badly as you do.

770
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,680
Well, I find that a
little hard to believe,

771
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,230
given what they did to Harriett
and Victoria and Penny.

772
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about Victoria?

773
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,940
You're welcome.

774
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,150
Yeah, you boned me, but

775
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,430
you also saved my life.

776
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,580
And I left you

777
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,790
alone when I shouldn't have.

778
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,020
Christ, okay, just go see
your family alread...

779
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,020
No, I... I don't... I don't understand.

780
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,480
What's to understand? They helped me.

781
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,320
They wanna help us. How
is any of that bad?

782
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,360
Sorry, are you smoking right now?

783
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,659
I was stoked to go on this

784
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,110
Quest and hang with you guys, but...

785
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,040
My ex is dead, and you two are
setting my ball hairs on end.

786
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,789
I need this.

787
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,580
I'm just glad I was a genius

788
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,380
who stashed high-end
party treats all over

789
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,910
while I was Substitute High King.

790
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,889
If the Library wanted to help,

791
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,530
why hide it from me?
Why not just tell me?

792
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,100
Because I know you.

793
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,450
And I know how you'd react. And you did.

794
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,790
Guys.

795
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,470
Guys.

796
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,840
Guys!

797
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,250
I know where the Sixth Key is.

798
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,350
Where?

799
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,530
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

800
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,690
Had it not been for you,
they'd all be dead.

801
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,290
I choose to be grateful.

802
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,580
I won't tell anyone about
what you did tonight.

803
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,560
It's too late.

804
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,630
There are consequences to broken deals.

805
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,000
Our word will mean nothing.

806
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,970
I'm sorry.

807
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,470
Of all the humans that
have ever sough me out,

808
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,050
you're the only one

809
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,150
who didn't do it for personal gain.

810
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,030
If more were like you,

811
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,500
we might have been able to coexist.

812
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,270
We still can.

813
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,230
We could at least try.

814
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,390
You and your companions
are on a Quest, correct?

815
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,930
For seven keys?

816
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,610
Yes.

817
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,310
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

818
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,470
But it's what created

819
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,340
and sustains the Fairy Realm.

820
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,440
Without the key, everything collapses,

821
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,610
which is why we can
never give it to you.

822
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,390
_

823
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,680
Howard.

824
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,690
What's your stupid book club reading?

825
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,550
Gill and Stacey...

826
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,520
Greatest love story ever written.

827
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,990
He's handsome and tough
and misunderstood,

828
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,820
but... but with a heart of gold.

829
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,230
And she is a driven woman

830
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,030
just trying to make it in
a man's world. So good.

831
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,740
I'm su... I'm sure it is.

832
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,099
Penny, meet Kathy.

833
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,530
Kathy, Penny.

834
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,790
Sup?

835
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,670
He supped me.

836
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,870
It's just like I always imagined.

837
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,010
Penny, try one of Kathy's cupcakes.

838
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,180
I promise you won't regret it.

839
