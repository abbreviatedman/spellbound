1
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:07,475
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,444
- I'm a librarian.

3
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,046
Currently on the lam from
a billion year contract.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,149
Sylvia, what'd you do?
- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,684
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

6
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,253
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

7
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,423
- I'm stuck in the Fairy Realm.
How can I see you?

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,692
- Let's you see into
other worlds, it's rad.

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,460
- You're the absolute
worst rulers

10
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,296
Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,164
- Honey, you don't
have to listen to Tick.

12
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,299
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:34,602
Turn around, head home,
relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,441
- It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

15
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,243
- This magic.

16
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,312
I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

17
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:45,613
- Oh, God,
they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,316
- You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,451
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,320
to snort so they can do
magic tricks.

21
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,388
I wanna help you
get out of here.

22
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,258
The necklace.

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,660
It kills them
when they use magic.

24
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,098
- So you're just okay
with letting Kady

25
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,333
take the Fifth Key, huh?

26
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,201
- I'm not letting her
do anything.

27
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,469
- But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

28
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,204
- Hey, Kady, I--

29
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,573
- Please leave a message
at the tone.

30
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,346
- Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

31
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,214
Look, she probably
took it because--

32
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:23,317
- Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

33
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,486
- At least I know
what Kady wants.

34
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,221
- What does that mean?

35
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,457
- She wants to talk to Penny.

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,359
But you, I don't--

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,127
First, you don't wanna help us
with the Quest.

38
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,130
Then, suddenly,
you want magic so badly

39
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,231
that you nearly
kill yourself.

40
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,233
- That's not fair.

41
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,335
None of that is fair.

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,404
- Okay, well, then what is it?

43
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,672
Do you--

44
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,409
Are you with us?
Do you want magic back?

45
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,413
- Of course I want magic.

46
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,248
- Okay, well,
then what changed?

47
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,783
Why now?

48
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,651
- As opposed to when, huh?

49
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,254
When you asked me
if I wanted to go on a Quest

50
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,656
five minutes
after my dad died?

51
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,260
Would you be ready
to go on a fucking adventure?

52
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,695
- Alice, I'm just--

53
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,198
- You know, and are you the
only one who's allowed to be

54
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,266
ambivalent and depressive and--

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,801
and scared
and hate themselves?

56
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,405
But I just have
to be sure of everything, huh?

57
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:21,409
Fuck you, Quentin.

58
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,278
- Uh, s--sorry.

59
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,314
I was just trying
to get through.

60
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,450
Sorry.

61
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,252
- We can fight about this
after the Quest.

62
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,322
Just let me see
the stupid book.

63
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,205
- Whoa.

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,706
- There's something
she's not telling me.

65
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,310
- You really think it was a
good idea to give her the book?

66
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,711
- I don't know.

67
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,613
She helped us
with the last key.

68
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,317
And we're probably gonna need
her for the next one, so...

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,490
The book says that
the Sixth Key is

70
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,459
in the Throne Room
at Whitespire.

71
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,261
- Oh, shit.

72
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,662
Wait, that's where
Margo and Eliot--

73
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,431
- Just got overthrown
violently?

74
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,568
Yeah.

75
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,303
Oh.

76
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,340
I need an aspirin.

77
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:38,252
Whoa.
Thank you.

78
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,256
- I'll never take magic
for granted again.

79
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,624
- Yeah.

80
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,760
Me neither.

81
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,629
Uh, look,

82
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,366
there's something I have to
finish here before I can leave.

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,302
I can't go knowing
that the fairies are--

84
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,538
- Jules, do what you gotta do.

85
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,541
Just be careful,
okay?

86
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,776
- You too.

87
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,346
Okay, so Skye's telling the
others what happened to her.

88
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,780
And that we wanna
help them escape.

89
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,517
But that can't happen until
we get their necklaces off.

90
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,651
- Oh.

91
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,354
There's an emoji of a dagger.

92
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,590
Todd was right, this truly is
the universal language.

93
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,825
- I need you to focus.

94
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,793
I can't find anything
on these necklaces,

95
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,462
and I need to know
how they work.

96
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,531
- Can't you see I'm busy?

97
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,932
- Fen.

98
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,335
Look, I know what the fairies
did to you in Fillory

99
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:28,469
was fucked up.

100
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,404
And I'm sorry about that, but--

101
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,739
- Yeah...

102
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,309
That's my response.

103
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:41,415
- Is that a gif of a crab
with a knife?

104
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,416
- It's how I feel.

105
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,519
Is it "gif" or "jif?"

106
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,622
- Please.
I need your help.

107
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,363
- Fairies just
make my skin crawl.

108
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,966
- Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

109
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,670
- So what you're saying is
that you want a fairy necklace

110
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,672
to examine?
- Yes.

111
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,442
One that isn't already attached
to a fairy's neck.

112
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,711
- Fine, but don't
expect me to pretend

113
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,381
like I don't
hate fairies.

114
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,716
- You don't have to.

115
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,452
We know about your fairies.

116
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,820
There's one
standing right there.

117
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,560
Fen's family had
a problem with them,

118
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,362
so I'm trying to help fix it.

119
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,464
- I hate them.
Their black eyes.

120
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,000
Their long fingers.
Their mushrooms.

121
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,502
- Mushrooms?

122
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,869
- They make the air thick
and musty,

123
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,739
like a bear's undercarriage.

124
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,709
- And what was the deal that
you made with these fairies?

125
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,477
- Oh, I didn't make a deal.

126
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,012
One was made for me by--
- By her family.

127
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,448
See, uh, they were tricked.

128
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,383
- Interesting.

129
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,752
And here I thought that
the fairies under my protection

130
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,387
were the last of their kind.

131
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,722
I wish.

132
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,457
They're everywhere in Fil--
- Fillmore.

133
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,791
Fillmore.

134
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,495
It's, um--it's a small farming
town in the Midwest.

135
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,730
- And what about you, Julia?

136
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,031
How is it that you
can see them?

137
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,499
- I made a deal
with a younger fairy.

138
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,702
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

139
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,671
- And just how young was
this fairy?

140
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,641
- I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

141
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,044
Which--which is
why we wanted to ask you,

142
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:22,416
how are the ones here,
you know, so docile?

143
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,652
- Well, I assume that you've
noticed that, uh,

144
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,655
all of my fairies have
this silver collar.

145
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,790
- You mean, their necklace?

146
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,492
Necklaces, yeah.

147
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,661
They are cute, aren't they?

148
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,465
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

149
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,699
You'll need one.

150
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,569
You can get it
from my Uncle Edwin.

151
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,871
But I'm gonna need
something in return.

152
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,839
- Of course.
If your rash is back--

153
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,710
- I'll need you
to bring me a fairy.

154
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,709
- Penny, during orientation,

155
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,111
weren't you trained on
how to properly re-shelve?

156
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,946
- We got a billion years,
Howard.

157
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,981
Just keeping shit interesting.

158
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,050
- So, uh, Penny.

159
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,489
My book club is looking
for new members.

160
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,892
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

161
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,029
- Why?
'Cause I'm brown?

162
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,998
And shackled?

163
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,867
You know this looks bad
for the Library, right?

164
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,503
- Oh, no.
We are not--

165
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,673
We shackle people of
all races and colors here.

166
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,542
- Not better, Howard.

167
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,143
- What I meant was...

168
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,978
I read your book.
- The hell?

169
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,614
- I had unresolved feelings
about my death

170
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,715
and your hand in it.

171
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,951
- You killed yourself.

172
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,919
- Am I misremembering
the part where you handed me

173
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:10,023
the cursed book
that directly led to that?

174
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,627
So the least you can do is
join my book club.

175
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,629
Kathy always brings cupcakes.
They're amazing.

176
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,599
- Fuck off, Howard.

177
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,635
- Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

178
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,838
Give it a think.

179
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,643
- Fasten it around the neck
to activate it.

180
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,846
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

181
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,716
Should deter them
from even trying.

182
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,652
Of course, you have to actually
catch a fairy first.

183
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,854
- Oh, I'm sure I'll figure
something out.

184
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,990
So, how does it work?

185
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,793
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's--

186
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,628
- That would be
a family secret.

187
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,798
- Okay.
Uh, but...

188
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,901
once it's on,
how will I know it's secure?

189
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,669
Has a fairy ever
broken out of one?

190
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:59,740
Dust.

191
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,942
This is Dust.

192
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,077
I've had him since
I was 16.

193
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,647
But he's been in
the family much longer.

194
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,682
How long?

195
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,584
- Over 400 years, sir.

196
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:14,688
- He may not look it,
but he's our oldest Fairy.

197
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:18,091
Tell Irene her guest
has a collar.

198
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,730
- Yes, sir.

199
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,965
- There's really only one way
to take them off.

200
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,634
I have a machine that does it.

201
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,002
So don't worry, they're secure.

202
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,841
- Great.

203
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,243
Thank you so much
for all your help.

204
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,851
- Today is not my day.

205
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,819
- I get that you're mad, okay?
But just hear me out.

206
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,756
- You turned me in, Sylvia.

207
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,624
- Look, when magic went out,

208
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,125
shit got really bad up there
for my family, okay?

209
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,863
My--my brothers,
my--my uncles, my dad,

210
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,732
they all got whacked.
- And went where?

211
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,735
To the Underworld?
Where you are?

212
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,004
All my people are up there,
Sylvia.

213
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,106
I can't travel,
I can't astral project,

214
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,742
I can't do shit
'cause of you.

215
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:12,646
- My family isn't
in the Underworld, Penny.

216
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,015
They moved on.

217
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,185
- To where?

218
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,020
- I mean,
I'm not sure.

219
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,022
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

220
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,725
You hang around for a bit,
and then

221
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,094
the bureaucracies that be
move you on.

222
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,031
But I don't know what
or where that is.

223
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,133
- So your family just left you?

224
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,936
- Yeah, Dad's always
sucked at waiting,

225
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,672
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

226
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,174
But these contracts that we
sign with the Library

227
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,678
are fucking ironclad,
so I can't go anywhere

228
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,780
until I finish
my billion years.

229
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,182
When the Library
put a bounty on you,

230
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:53,020
it brought me a million years
closer to my family, Penny.

231
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,688
And I'm sorry.

232
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,089
I know that
that doesn't fix anything--

233
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,191
- Yeah, you're right.

234
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,794
It fixes shit.

235
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,067
- I spoke to a few
of the others.

236
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,703
They don't believe me.

237
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,005
If I hadn't done the magic,

238
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,843
if I hadn't felt what happened,

239
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,878
I don't think I would
believe me either.

240
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,346
- Okay, Skye.

241
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,981
You've got to keep trying.

242
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,117
- How?
What should I say?

243
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,986
- Look, I don't know,

244
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,722
but I found a way
to take off the collars.

245
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,257
Edwin's got a machine
in the Lab.

246
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,894
- It won't matter.
They're scared.

247
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,097
The thought of escape is
like a death wish.

248
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,832
But...

249
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,001
there is one more thing.

250
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,838
Several of Ms. Irene's family
have arrived.

251
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,173
Many of them brought
their fairies.

252
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,842
- To Brakebills?

253
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,843
Why?

254
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,011
- I don't know.

255
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,145
- Skye.

256
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,380
- I'm sorry.

257
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,049
- It's okay.

258
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,755
- If Skye can't convince them
to run, what are we gonna do?

259
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,025
- We introduce them
to someone scarier.

260
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,798
- I'm on a flying boat!

261
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:15,002
- Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

262
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,004
Where Tick's waiting
with a serrated spoon

263
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,872
to just saw off our heads?

264
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,240
- Tick isn't at Whitespire,
though.

265
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,075
He's up north, near Loria.

266
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,812
- The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

267
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,313
So the book says
that the Sixth Key

268
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,016
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half moons,

269
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,784
which is a thing
that happens in Fillory.

270
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:34,287
- Like two black and white
cookies split apart

271
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:38,258
to form one giant white cookie.

272
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,227
A cookie moon.

273
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,295
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,864
Uh, anyway,

275
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,900
so it--it's gonna be
super bright,

276
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,101
um, and it happens tonight,
so--

277
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,337
- Wait, why is Tick up near
Loria?

278
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,039
- Fillory's at war.
- What?

279
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,206
- The fuck?

280
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,975
- I know, we are
literally Questing

281
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,877
through a war-torn country.

282
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,145
So epic.

283
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,180
- And who exactly
are we at war with?

284
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,149
- The Lorians and the Floaters.

285
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,084
- Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

286
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,186
- That cock's High King
for three seconds

287
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,320
and it all goes
to shit.

288
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,056
- I need to send
a Bunny to Idri.

289
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,058
- Yeah, I'll send one
to that Stone bitch.

290
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,926
- Wait, what about the key?

291
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,294
- Q, you just told us,

292
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,297
Fillory is being spit-roasted
by invading forces.

293
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,866
Without us.

294
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,467
- Okay, can I say
something obvious,

295
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,370
yet potentially controversial?

296
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,039
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

297
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,207
- Says who?

298
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,309
- Fillory,
when they overthrew you.

299
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,279
- Mm...
- Well, they were misguided,

300
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,347
and scared,
and they needed scapegoats.

301
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,350
At some point, you either have
to choose to follow through

302
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,386
on something, or just,

303
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,221
well,

304
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,255
die.

305
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,859
- Look, we chose this.

306
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,095
You captain the Key Quest,
Coldwater,

307
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,030
and we'll stop war.

308
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,000
- Ooh, ooh, can you drop us off
at Whitespire

309
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,034
after it gets dark?

310
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,402
They have that balcony.

311
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,238
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

312
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,207
It would be dope.

313
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,242
- Get ready to tuck and roll,
bitches,

314
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,084
- Yes, once fairies
lived on Earth.

315
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,088
But not in hundreds of years.

316
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,625
Not since we fled to Fillory
because human Magicians

317
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,628
nearly hunted us
into extinction.

318
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,030
- I had no idea.

319
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,965
- Of course not.

320
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,135
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

321
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,971
- I'm sorry.

322
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,240
- So you'll understand
my disbelief then

323
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,176
when a human tries
to lure me to Earth

324
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,980
with tales of a lost tribe
that can't exist.

325
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,381
- But they're not--
- I've heard enough.

326
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,951
- Wait.

327
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,652
You're not listening.

328
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,055
- I'd rather remove
your tongue.

329
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,123
Maybe your teeth.

330
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,124
You choose.

331
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,559
- Go ahead.

332
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,996
You have already taken
so much from me.

333
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,564
What's a few teeth?

334
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,203
- You've got two sentences.

335
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,173
Choose wisely.

336
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,276
- I hate fairies.

337
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:14,014
So why would I come here, to
a place where you stole my toes

338
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,651
and I lost my child,
if it wasn't true?

339
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,021
- Then why would you
do this for me?

340
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,156
- It's not for you.

341
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,125
It's for them.
- They're still fairies.

342
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,593
- But they're nothing like you.

343
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,129
They're more like
traumatized children.

344
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,999
And as a mother,
despite what you did to me,

345
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,701
they deserve a chance to live.

346
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,703
So get off your...

347
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,107
whatever it is fairies
have for rear butts,

348
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,741
and do something.

349
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,212
They need their Queen.

350
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,734
- What part of the Library

351
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,703
is "Secrets Taken
to the Grave"?

352
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,140
- Oh, so now you're
talking to me?

353
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,242
I'm--I'm kidding.
Chill.

354
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:20,180
Uh, it's some weird
research division

355
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,382
that the Library made
in partnership with the people

356
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,751
who run the Underworld.

357
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,754
Librarians like us aren't even
allowed to go in there.

358
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,193
- What the hell do they do
to these people?

359
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,761
- Oh, it's like primal therapy

360
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,296
for people who are
about to move on.

361
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,131
You go and unload your bullshit

362
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,366
and it lightens your
conscience.

363
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,134
I'm sure my dad's
was a nightmare.

364
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,269
- This is all part of that

365
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,803
"Underworld is
a way station" shit?

366
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,672
- Yeah, they, like, jot down
everything of note,

367
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,041
and then at the end you get
a metro card out of here.

368
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,777
- You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

369
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,247
- Well, it's more like
this giant, long,

370
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,117
pig-type creature that you,
like, climb into,

371
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,119
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

372
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,787
- Why the hell
are we still here?

373
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,021
Why haven't we hijacked
that long pig?

374
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,424
- Because it only shows up when
somebody has a metro card

375
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,159
and is ready to move on.

376
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,797
- Our contracts will
never let us move on.

377
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,802
- Nobody's ever gonna give us
metro cards, Penny.

378
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,405
Not like them.

379
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,112
- Okay, so in this chapter

380
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,115
the Daughter,
she finally becomes the Knight

381
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,118
that she set out to be,
and right after she's knighted,

382
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:35,222
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back.

383
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,291
- What're you doing?
- Guys, guys.

384
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,861
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so--

385
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,331
- The book says the moonlight
has to hit three keystones

386
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,832
to reveal the key.

387
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,367
There's three doors,
three keystones,

388
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,302
and none of them
are near a window.

389
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,271
- Okay, so we set up
some mirrors,

390
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,839
and bounce around
some moonlight,

391
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,806
and then we're back
on track?

392
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,242
Enjoying the Quest?

393
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,476
- Yeah, if that's
what the book says.

394
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,844
- You know it does.

395
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,846
- Hey.

396
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,848
Look, it's a perfect metaphor
for your relationship.

397
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,353
Not ready to laugh...

398
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,121
yet, that's fine.

399
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,857
- You want me to put on
a slave collar?

400
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,891
- It's the only way we can get
you in direct contact

401
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,860
with Irene's fairies.

402
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,329
- Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

403
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,597
- For all we know,
the McAllistairs

404
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,466
can trigger
the collars remotely.

405
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,134
And just like that----

406
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,303
Every collared fairy
will be dead.

407
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,772
We need to be stealth.
Smart.

408
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,340
- Tell me,

409
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,877
what's smart about rendering
myself defenseless

410
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,182
and then entrusting my life
to a powerless Magician?

411
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,637
You're god-touched.

412
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,207
- That's one way to put it.

413
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,908
But it also means
I can protect you.

414
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,244
- It doesn't mean
that I trust you.

415
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,279
- I get it.
For good reason.

416
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,481
Why would you trust
any human on Earth?

417
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,418
But Fen and I
are risking our lives.

418
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,952
So we need you to trust us.

419
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,222
- Or don't.

420
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,190
And we can just do this
on our own.

421
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,825
Without you.

422
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,860
- She's right.

423
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,563
I'm not sure how,
but we will find a way.

424
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,366
- What is it that you want
from us?

425
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,301
- Not sure I understand.

426
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,538
- She's healing
a mother's wound, but you...

427
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,873
Why go so far, Julia?

428
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,546
- Let's just say being
god-touched is a mixed bag.

429
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,282
But I choose
to do something with that.

430
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,251
It means something.

431
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,552
Helping those fairies,

432
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,455
saving them, with you.

433
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,329
And this collar.

434
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:07,340
- She really is stunning.

435
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,843
How many more of them
are there?

436
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,412
- Hard to say, really.

437
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,614
They're not all that friendly.

438
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,949
- And where did you say
your friend is from again?

439
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,652
- The Midwest.
- No, I mean what town is she--

440
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:28,295
Huh, excuse me.

441
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,833
- Fairly well-behaved,
actually,

442
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,702
considering she's feral.

443
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,637
- Guess I got lucky, huh?

444
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,275
- Uh, that's a much faster
turnaround than we agreed on.

445
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,312
You know what,
it'll be a push,

446
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,880
but I think I can get it
to you all by then.

447
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,816
The others will take some
convincing--

448
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,318
- Looks like we're working
through dinner.

449
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,886
You know what to do with her.

450
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,857
- ...especially if
time is against us.

451
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,993
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

452
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,829
But we'll talk later?

453
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,731
About the other fairies?

454
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,032
- Of course.

455
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,474
Shit.

456
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,854
- It's true.

457
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,857
What Julia said.
You're real.

458
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,696
You're a queen.

459
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,764
She's a queen.

460
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,133
Of the free fairies.

461
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,940
- Never bow your head.

462
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:25,412
For anyone.

463
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,421
- Collar breaker,
collar breaker,

464
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,424
where are you?

465
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,772
- Ready the chair.
I need to check the equipment.

466
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,174
- Yes, sir.

467
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,427
- They're saying they want
everything.

468
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,862
Our entire supply.

469
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,497
- Look, I know that it
sounds risky,

470
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,866
but there is a limited time
to this offer.

471
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,934
If we don't--
- Risky? No.

472
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:25,171
Reckless.
Leave us.

473
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:29,075
- Though we've been separated
by time and great distance,

474
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,210
we are the same.

475
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,047
We are spun
from divine inspiration.

476
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,816
Blessed.

477
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,787
We are the living
embodiment of magic.

478
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,523
- I may have secured
a new source.

479
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,191
- Of fairies?
How?

480
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,159
- Ask Edwin.
He's seen her.

481
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:51,531
- So I've come to restore
your strength.

482
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:57,003
To help you understand
the glory of who you are.

483
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,507
Your suffering is my suffering.

484
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,877
Your injustice, mine.

485
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,979
- Where is Edwin?
- Edwin?

486
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:10,550
Edwin is working.

487
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,224
- And when we
are finally free,

488
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:22,862
we are gonna hunt down every
last living slaver,

489
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,931
gouge out their eyes,

490
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,533
cut out their tongues,

491
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:31,170
and hang them
by their own entrails.

492
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,915
- You may feel a pinch,
but if you relax,

493
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:47,219
it'll be brief.

494
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:57,830
- You want us to pull back
our advancements on Fillory?

495
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,100
- This is ridiculous.

496
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,603
- All we're really asking is
that we pause the invasion.

497
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:06,072
- You both know that
the only reason Eliot and I

498
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,108
are in this mess is because
of fairy meddling bullshit.

499
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,277
- And as soon as we clear this
up with the people of Fillory--

500
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,146
- Deposed rulers don't get
their thrones back.

501
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,648
They exile themselves.

502
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,216
Or die at the hands
of the mob.

503
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,285
- Is this how you talk
to all your allies?

504
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,087
- Allies?

505
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,289
My dear, I have yet to see any
proof that your marriage

506
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,124
to my son was ever
even consummated.

507
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,094
- I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

508
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,131
- Are you sure that wasn't
from the toad bite?

509
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,566
- You saw it?

510
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,301
- Of course I did.
I'm his mother.

511
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:39,305
- Wow, that's a lot to process.

512
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,908
- In any case, I have no faith
in either of you

513
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,643
reclaiming your thrones.

514
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,812
We will continue
our advancement on Fillory.

515
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,814
- I'm afraid Loria declines
as well.

516
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,783
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

517
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:54,353
It makes no sense to withdraw
when I know we'll succeed.

518
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,290
I have to do what's best
for my people.

519
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,792
- And what about
our engagement?

520
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,294
- You're no longer king, Eliot.

521
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,330
So it's no longer valid.

522
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:09,736
- King Idri, are you saying you
have yet to take a husband?

523
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,639
My son's marble has
yet to be polished.

524
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,841
- You mossy, pimping bitch.

525
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:18,110
- Will you excuse us
for two seconds?

526
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:21,380
As much as I would love to roll
your smother-in-law

527
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,949
off our boat, it won't prevent
either one of them

528
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,851
from invading Fillory.

529
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,953
- We need to split those two up
before your man's arranged

530
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,722
to marry my child bride.

531
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,858
- And our best plan is...

532
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,664
- We offer them magic.

533
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,137
- What the--

534
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,676
- Fen!

535
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,310
- I just watched him
help kill a fairy.

536
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,180
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

537
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,248
just a machine that
removes their heads.

538
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,284
- What?

539
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,419
- All right, we just need to
figure something out.

540
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,655
- There's nothing.

541
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,390
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

542
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,861
- Wait, the magic that
controls the collars,

543
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:12,732
they're fairy deals?

544
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,768
Edwin said you're
the oldest of the fairies.

545
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,270
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

546
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,206
Yes.

547
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:25,411
How could you do that
to your own people?

548
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,247
- Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

549
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,282
out of existence nearly.

550
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,885
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

551
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,789
Several of us volunteered to
bind ourselves to the collars

552
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,357
and the McAllistairs.

553
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,928
A deal that would keep them
from following.

554
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,264
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

555
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,900
But as my generation died,

556
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:52,238
and younger generations
were born into this life,

557
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,041
I lost faith
in that sacrifice.

558
00:27:55,074 --> 00:28:00,813
Or in the belief that my Queen
had made it to the other side.

559
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,783
- She did.

560
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,952
My mother, your Queen,

561
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,756
led us to Fillory,
where I was born.

562
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,491
And we were able
to create a home there.

563
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,329
All because of your sacrifice.

564
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:23,235
- You never should have come.

565
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,038
Because now you can
never go back.

566
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,080
- There is a way to break
a fairy deal, isn't there?

567
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:37,449
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

568
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,951
Of course it does.

569
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,353
- I will not do it.

570
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,991
Our deals are the foundation
of our culture

571
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,526
and key to our survival.

572
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,963
- You are their Queen.

573
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:55,267
You came here to save them.
If you don't, what's the point?

574
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:59,371
- Fairies are known
for honoring their deals.

575
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:03,342
When we break them,
we lose the people's trust

576
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:08,014
and our limited leverage,
which we need for survival.

577
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:12,284
Without that,
we are weak and vulnerable.

578
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:14,486
It would be better
for all of us

579
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,388
for me to take it
to the grave.

580
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,024
- Which will be soon enough!

581
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,558
Against the wall.

582
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,361
Dust, we're on a schedule.

583
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,473
- Do not go with him.

584
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,408
- What did I just say?

585
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,377
- I won't let you do this.

586
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,316
- I do not have time for this.

587
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,858
Stop!
No!

588
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,412
- What the fuck?

589
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,898
Ah!

590
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,037
- You guarantee that this is
the best decision

591
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,638
for our family?
- I guarantee it.

592
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,942
- Do not make me
regret my decision, Irene.

593
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,945
- Oh, Vincent, when have I ever
steered this family wrong?

594
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,014
Cheers.

595
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,581
- To us. To a new future.
- Cheers.

596
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,618
- Oh.

597
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,526
Ahh!

598
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,102
- Shit.

599
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:47,273
It seems like those Secrets
dicks really made you earn it.

600
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:51,110
Any idea where you're going now
that you're moving on?

601
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,279
- No, they, uh--
they didn't really say.

602
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,214
- Well, who'd you talk to?

603
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,216
Was it Fran?
Oh, she's--

604
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,518
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and--

605
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,353
Never really know
which one to focus on

606
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,222
'cause they're both moving.

607
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,523
- I--I had, uh--

608
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,492
I couldn't really see
his face under his hood,

609
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:11,097
but he had--
he had glowing red eyes.

610
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,000
- Oh.
- What--what does that mean?

611
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:20,072
- Oh, you must have done some
horrible shit in your time.

612
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,241
- Wait, wait, uh,
whe--where am I going?

613
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,310
Is it hell?

614
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,381
- If only.

615
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:33,252
At least hell is warm.

616
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,021
- There's a place
worse than hell?

617
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,190
- Oh, and way more creative
with what they plug

618
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,126
all of your
openings up with.

619
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,527
I'm not ready.

620
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,430
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

621
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,504
- Hello, Penny.

622
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,140
Let's chat.

623
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,279
- I've missed this.

624
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,548
But it doesn't change anything.

625
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,153
- You know what Margo's
doing right now?

626
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,487
She's convincing
the Stone Queen

627
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,157
that we'll get
magic back.

628
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,558
Because we will.

629
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,460
And she's threatening her
with it.

630
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,497
- If I'm lying,
invade later and kill me.

631
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,600
But if I'm not,
do you really wanna fight

632
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,703
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

633
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,108
your entire army
into fucking compost?

634
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,544
- And is that your
strategy as well?

635
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,181
To threaten me?

636
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,115
- I'd be well within my rights,

637
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:40,552
given that your army is
about to attack us.

638
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:45,191
But no,
I'm not threatening you.

639
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:49,161
I am promising you--
- What exactly?

640
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,430
- On the off chance
this is true,

641
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,200
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

642
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,468
- Once we give back
magic to the people,

643
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,538
we won't have to take anything.

644
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:03,509
Hell, they'll be begging us
to take back our thrones.

645
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:08,214
- Our Magicians can identify
anyone with magical talent.

646
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,119
And it's likely that many of
your people have it

647
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,387
without the education
to know it.

648
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,226
So we'll educate them.

649
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:24,630
Soon you could have magic
as powerful as ours.

650
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,246
- I usually like to keep
a certain amount of distance

651
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,380
between myself
and the residents,

652
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,251
but you are just
so fucking fascinating.

653
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,385
- What?

654
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,355
- I've never seen anyone fight
their destiny so hard

655
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:52,524
while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

656
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,626
I mean, you narrowly
escaped death.

657
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,362
Twice.

658
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,298
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

659
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,632
Who does that?

660
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,669
- Yeah, I still have
no idea who you are.

661
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,272
- Hades.

662
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,474
Hades.

663
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:11,177
Like the god?
- Shh.

664
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,413
I told you, low profile.

665
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,552
- Okay, so what the hell are
you doing talking to me?

666
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,522
Look, is this about the metro--
- No, it's not about that.

667
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,625
It's much more big picture.

668
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,561
Let's talk about your future
as a Librarian.

669
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,197
- Or not.

670
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,732
- This is about that Quest,
isn't it?

671
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,302
Let me tell you something
about that.

672
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:39,305
It doesn't matter.

673
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,539
- Easy for a god to say.

674
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:44,676
- Spoiler alert--
magic always comes back.

675
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,446
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

676
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,416
verging on the brink
of extinction, but it will.

677
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,584
Because ultimately,

678
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:57,389
magic's a carrot gods use
to keep humans in check.

679
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:59,525
It's a lot to take in,
I know.

680
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:03,595
My point is,
your life as a human,

681
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:06,465
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

682
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,369
This Quest, your friends,

683
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,338
in a thousand years,

684
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:15,274
hazy at best.

685
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,509
Your life starts now,

686
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:20,346
after death.

687
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,414
And yes, I realize
the phrasing is confusing.

688
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:24,583
- Okay, what--what is this?

689
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,352
Is this some kind of
fucked up punishment

690
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,386
for stealing
a metro card?

691
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,355
- Hardly.

692
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,589
There are a lot of places
you could've ended up

693
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,391
that aren't nearly
as nice as the Underworld.

694
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,261
- Shackled to a trolley
re-shelving books?

695
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,364
- We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

696
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:40,499
with almost an eternity
to explore it.

697
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,902
And if you want the shackles
off, go to Howard.

698
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:47,339
- So I have to join a book club
to free myself?

699
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:50,376
- All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

700
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,511
and be part of something.

701
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,813
You've got that
whole loner thing,

702
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,783
but it's obviously a front.

703
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,652
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

704
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,621
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

705
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,391
- Yeah, okay, you and everyone
else down here

706
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,393
that's read my book--what,
you just think you know me?

707
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,495
- But it's why you're always
sacrificing yourself

708
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,397
for people, right?

709
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,799
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

710
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:17,436
If you're that desperate to
move on and maybe somehow

711
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,572
fumble your way back
to your old life,

712
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,841
I won't stop you.

713
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,444
But I'm telling you, Penny,

714
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,314
if you stay down here,

715
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:32,551
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

716
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,803
- And that should be
the last keystone, right?

717
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,343
- I don't understand.

718
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,814
- Would you stop--

719
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,015
- You keep acting like
this is your book.

720
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,384
- Maybe 'cause I've been
on the Quest

721
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,718
for more than
two minutes--

722
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:10,055
- Guys, snoop-and-poop voices.
Please.

723
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,990
- You're hiding something
from me.

724
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,792
- Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

725
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,927
- Guys, seriously, I just got
out of a fantasy prison,

726
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,529
and I don't wanna end up
in a real one.

727
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:20,098
- Are you working
for the Library?

728
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,800
- Yes.

729
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,802
- Surprisingly honest.
That's...

730
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,404
- Are you trying to stop us?

731
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,805
- No.

732
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:27,973
They wanna help us.

733
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,441
They want magic back
as badly as you do.

734
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,810
- Well, I find that a little
hard to believe,

735
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,012
given what they did to Harriett
and Victoria and Penny.

736
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,748
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about Victoria?

737
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,425
- You're welcome.

738
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:51,830
Yeah, you boned me,
but you also saved my life.

739
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:56,835
And I left you alone
when I shouldn't have.

740
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:05,844
Christ, okay, just go see
your family alread--

741
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,850
- No, I--I don't--
I don't understand.

742
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,452
- What's to understand?
They helped me.

743
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,954
They wanna help us.
How is any of that bad?

744
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,126
- Sorry, are you smoking
right now?

745
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,863
I was stoked to go on this
Quest and hang with you guys,

746
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,832
but...

747
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,868
my ex is dead, and you two are
setting my ball hairs on end.

748
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,870
I need this.

749
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,505
I'm just glad I was a genius

750
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,140
who stashed high-end
party treats all over

751
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,776
while I was
Substitute High King.

752
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,615
- If the Library
wanted to help,

753
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:46,151
why hide it from me?
Why not just tell me?

754
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,819
- Because I know you.

755
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:49,955
And I know how you'd react.
And you did.

756
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,057
- Guys.

757
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,459
Guys.

758
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,793
Guys!

759
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,128
I know where the Sixth Key is.

760
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,097
- Where?

761
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:05,504
- I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

762
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,840
- Had it not been for you,
they'd all be dead.

763
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:11,910
I choose to be grateful.

764
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:16,047
- I won't tell anyone
about what you did tonight.

765
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,183
- It's too late.

766
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:21,453
There are consequences
to broken deals.

767
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,922
Our word will mean nothing.

768
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,924
- I'm sorry.

769
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,129
- Of all the humans that
have ever sough me out,

770
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,866
you're the only one who didn't
do it for personal gain.

771
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,936
If more were like you,

772
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,539
we might have been
able to coexist.

773
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:44,009
- We still can.

774
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,978
We could at least try.

775
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,048
- You and your companions
are on a Quest, correct?

776
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,684
For seven keys?

777
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:54,953
- Yes.

778
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:59,257
- We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

779
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,127
But it's what created

780
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,030
and sustains
the Fairy Realm.

781
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:09,535
Without the key,
everything collapses,

782
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,237
which is why we can never
give it to you.

783
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,983
- Howard.

784
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,521
What's your stupid
book club reading?

785
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,209
- Gill and Stacey--

786
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,179
greatest love story
ever written.

787
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:57,749
He's handsome and tough
and misunderstood,

788
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,618
but--but with a heart of gold.

789
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:01,953
And she is a driven woman

790
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,589
just trying to make it
in a man's world.

791
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,256
So good.

792
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,759
- I'm su--I'm sure it is.

793
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:09,928
- Penny, meet Kathy.

794
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,196
Kathy, Penny.

795
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,632
- Sup?

796
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,300
- He supped me.

797
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,669
It's just like
I always imagined.

798
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,772
- Penny, try one
of Kathy's cupcakes.

799
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:24,776
I promise you won't regret it.
