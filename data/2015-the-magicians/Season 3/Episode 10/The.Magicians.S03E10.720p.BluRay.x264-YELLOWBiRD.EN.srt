1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,370
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,622
<i>I'm a Librarian.</i>

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,079
<i>Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.</i>

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,755
Sylvia, what'd you do?

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,841
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,759
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,212
Not till you tell me what you were
doing in the Library.

8
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,424
I'm stuck in the Fairy Realm.
How can I see you?

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,760
<i>Lets you see
into other worlds, it's rad.</i>

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,267
You're the absolute
worst rulers Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,098
Honey, you don't have to
listen to Tick.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,336
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,694
Turn around, head home,
relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,445
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,198
<i>This magic.</i>

16
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,279
I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,659
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,287
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,460
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,287
<i>to snort so they can do
magic tricks.</i>

21
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,373
I wanna help you
get out of here.

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,208
The necklace.

23
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,760
It kills them
when they use magic.

24
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,718
So you're just okay with letting
Kady take the Fifth Key, huh?

25
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,552
I'm not letting her do anything.

26
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,957
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,563
Hey, Kady, I...

28
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,016
<i>Please
leave a message at the tone.</i>

29
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,354
Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

30
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,356
Look, she probably
took it because...

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,363
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

32
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,696
At least I know what Kady wants.

33
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,371
What does that mean?

34
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,665
She wants to talk to Penny.

35
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,538
But you, I don't...

36
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,314
First, you don't wanna help us
with the quest.

37
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,378
Then, suddenly, you want magic
so badly that you nearly kill yourself.

38
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,379
That's not fair.

39
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,506
None of that is fair.

40
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,589
Okay, well, then what is it?

41
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,923
Do you...

42
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,135
Are you with us?
Do you want magic back?

43
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,679
Of course I want magic.

44
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,398
Okay, well, then what changed?

45
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,484
Why now?

46
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,894
As opposed to when, huh?

47
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,401
When you asked me
if I wanted to go on a quest

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,903
five minutes after my dad died?

49
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,407
Would you be ready
to go on a fucking adventure?

50
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,955
Alice, I'm just...

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,327
You know, and are you the only
one who's allowed to be

52
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,409
ambivalent and depressive and...

53
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,084
And scared and hate themselves?

54
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,585
But I just have to be sure
of everything, huh?

55
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,040
Fuck you, Quentin.

56
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,421
Uh... Sorry.

57
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,471
I was just trying
to get through.

58
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,674
Sorry.

59
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,390
We can fight about this
after the quest.

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,346
Just let me see the stupid book.

61
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,828
Whoa.

62
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,952
There's something
she's not telling me.

63
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,457
You really think it was a good idea
to give her the book?

64
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,957
I don't know.

65
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,835
She helped us with the last key.

66
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,464
And we're probably gonna
need her for the next one, so...

67
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,383
The book says that the Sixth Key

68
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,638
is in the Throne Room
at Whitespire.

69
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,390
Oh, shit.

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
Wait, that's where Margo
and Eliot...

71
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,598
Just got overthrown violently?

72
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,774
Yeah.

73
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,238
I need an aspirin.

74
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,369
Thank you.

75
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,381
I'll never take magic
for granted again.

76
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,833
Yeah.

77
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,543
Me neither.

78
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,838
Uh, look,

79
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,516
there's something I have to
finish here before I can leave.

80
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,434
I can't go knowing that
the fairies are...

81
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,730
Jules, do what you gotta do.

82
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,729
Just be careful, okay?

83
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,935
You too.

84
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,480
Okay, so Skye's telling the others
what happened to her

85
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,031
and that we wanna
help them escape.

86
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,700
But that can't happen until
we get their necklaces off.

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,488
There's an emoji of a dagger.

88
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,791
Todd was right, this truly is
the universal language.

89
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,084
I need you to focus.

90
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,629
I can't find anything on these necklaces,
and I need to know how they work.

91
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,172
Can't you see I'm busy?

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,211
Fen.

93
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,636
Look, I know what the fairies
did to you in Fillory was fucked up.

94
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,554
And I'm sorry about that, but...

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,972
Yeah...

96
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,390
That's my response.

97
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,562
Is that a gif of a crab
with a knife?

98
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,651
It's how I feel.

99
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,695
Is it "gif" or "jif"?

100
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,864
Please. I need your help.

101
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,492
Fairies just make my skin crawl.

102
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,790
Okay, and how does slavery
make you feel?

103
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,875
So what you're saying is
that you want a fairy necklace

104
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,876
- to examine?
- Yes.

105
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,585
One that isn't already
attached to a fairy's neck.

106
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,920
Fine, but don't expect me
to pretend

107
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,471
like I don't hate fairies.

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,807
You don't have to.

109
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,635
We know about your fairies.

110
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,475
There's one
standing right there.

111
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,480
Fen's family had a problem with them,
so I'm trying to help fix it.

112
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,610
I hate them. Their black eyes.

113
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,283
Their long fingers.
Their mushrooms.

114
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,656
"Mushrooms"?

115
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,282
They make the air thick
and musty,

116
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,956
like a bear's undercarriage.

117
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,910
And what was the deal that
you made with these fairies?

118
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,619
Oh, I didn't make a deal.

119
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,358
- One was made for me by...
- By her family.

120
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,590
See, they were tricked.

121
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,008
Interesting.

122
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,965
And here I thought that the fairies
under my protection

123
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,512
were the last of their kind.

124
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,930
I wish.

125
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,656
- They're everywhere in Fil...
- Fillmore.

126
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,017
Fillmore.

127
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,642
It's, um... It's a small farming town
in the Midwest.

128
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,938
And what about you, Julia?

129
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,310
How is it that you can see them?

130
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,711
I made a deal
with a younger fairy.

131
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,772
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

132
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,855
And just how young
was this fairy?

133
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,817
I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

134
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,653
Which is why
we wanted to ask you,

135
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,906
how are the ones here,

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,741
you know, so docile?

137
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,839
Well, I assume that you've noticed that
all of my fairies have this silver collar.

138
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,085
You mean, their necklace?

139
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,629
Necklaces, yeah.

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,837
They are cute, aren't they?

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,798
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

142
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,891
You'll need one.

143
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,720
You can get it
from my Uncle Edwin.

144
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,100
But I'm gonna need
something in return.

145
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,056
Of course.
If your rash is back...

146
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,859
I'll need you to bring me
a fairy.

147
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,885
Penny, during orientation,

148
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,391
weren't you trained on how to
properly reshelve the books?

149
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,188
We got a billion years, Howard.

150
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,231
Just keeping shit interesting.

151
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,604
So, uh, Penny.

152
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,614
My book club is looking
for new members.

153
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,114
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

154
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,288
Why? 'Cause I'm brown?

155
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,706
And shackled?

156
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,146
You know this looks bad
for the Library, right?

157
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,628
Oh, no. We are not...

158
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,832
We shackle people of
all races and colors here.

159
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,667
Not better, Howard.

160
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,423
What I meant was...

161
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,220
- I read your book.
- The hell?

162
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,890
I had unresolved feelings about
my death and your hand in it.

163
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,185
You killed yourself.

164
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,150
Am I misremembering
the part where you handed me

165
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,065
the cursed book that directly
led to that?

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,774
So the least you can do is
join my book club.

167
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,775
Kathy always brings cupcakes.
They're amazing.

168
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,733
Fuck off, Howard.

169
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,786
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

170
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,112
Give it a think.

171
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,786
Fasten it around the neck
to activate it.

172
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,043
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

173
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,500
Should deter them
from even trying.

174
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,511
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

175
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,758
Oh, I'm sure I'll figure
something out.

176
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,598
So, how does it work?

177
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,972
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's...

178
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,769
That would be a family secret.

179
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:48,193
Okay. Uh, but... Once it's on,
how will I know it's secure?

180
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,482
Has a fairy ever
broken out of one?

181
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,779
Dust.

182
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,234
This is Dust.

183
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,328
I've had him since I was 16.

184
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,781
But he's been in the family
much longer.

185
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
How long?

186
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,413
Over 400 years, sir.

187
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,543
He may not look it,
but he's our oldest Fairy.

188
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,046
Tell Irene
her guest has a collar.

189
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,669
Yes, sir.

190
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,182
There's really only one way
to take them off.

191
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,759
I have a machine that does it.

192
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,266
So don't worry, they're secure.

193
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,390
Great.

194
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,523
Thank you so much
for all your help.

195
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,284
Today is not my day.

196
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,057
I get that you're mad, okay?
But just hear me out.

197
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,073
- Okay?
- You turned me in, Sylvia.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,741
Look, when magic went out,

199
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,438
shit got really bad up there
for my family, okay?

200
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:52,127
My... My brothers, my... My uncles,
my dad, they all got whacked.

201
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,333
And went where?

202
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,960
To the Underworld?
Where you are?

203
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,213
All my people
are up there, Sylvia.

204
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,424
I can't travel,
I can't astral project,

205
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,601
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

206
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,599
My family isn't
in the Underworld, Penny.

207
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,223
They moved on.

208
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,525
To where?

209
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,237
I mean, I'm not sure.

210
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,235
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

211
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:22,320
You hang around for a bit, and then
the bureaucracies that be move you on.

212
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,076
But I don't know what
or where that is.

213
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,371
So your family just left you?

214
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,124
Yeah, Dad's always sucked
at waiting,

215
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,797
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

216
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,421
But these contracts
that we sign with the Library

217
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,800
are fucking ironclad,
so I can't go anywhere

218
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,926
until I finish my billion years.

219
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,429
When the Library put
a bounty on you,

220
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,229
it brought me a million years
closer to my family, Penny.

221
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,805
And I'm sorry.

222
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,377
I know that
that doesn't fix anything...

223
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,608
Yeah, you're right.

224
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,939
It fixes shit.

225
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,277
I spoke to a few of the others.

226
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,781
They don't believe me.

227
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:10,376
If I hadn't done the magic,
if I hadn't felt what happened,

228
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,044
I don't think
I would believe me either.

229
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,622
Okay, Skye.

230
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,173
You've got to keep trying.

231
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,343
How? What should I say?

232
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,844
Look, I don't know, but I found
a way to take off the collars.

233
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,515
Edwin's got a machine
in the lab.

234
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,061
It won't matter. They're scared.

235
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,311
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

236
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,564
But... There is one more thing.

237
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,317
Several of Ms. Irene's family
have arrived.

238
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,398
Many of them
brought their fairies.

239
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,573
To Brakebills?

240
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,037
Why?

241
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,202
I don't know.

242
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,370
Skye.

243
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,664
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,866
It's okay.

245
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,876
If Skye can't convince them
to run, what are we gonna do?

246
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,709
We introduce them
to someone scarier.

247
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,924
I'm on a flying boat!

248
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:10,182
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

249
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,015
Where Tick's waiting with a serrated
spoon to just saw off our heads?

250
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,474
Tick isn't at Whitespire,
though.

251
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,275
He's up north, near Loria.

252
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,945
The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

253
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,567
So the book says
that the Sixth Key

254
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,196
will only reveal itself
in the light of two half moons,

255
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,901
which is a thing that happens
in Fillory.

256
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,534
Like two black and white
cookies split apart

257
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:33,493
to form one giant white cookie.

258
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,452
A cookie moon.

259
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,588
Mmm-hmm.

260
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,294
Anyway, so it... It's gonna be super
bright, um, and it happens tonight, so...

261
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,596
Wait, why is Tick up near Loria?

262
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,218
- Fillory's at war.
- What?

263
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,424
The fuck?

264
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,011
I know, we are literally questing
through a war-torn country.

265
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,346
So epic.

266
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,396
And who exactly
are we at war with?

267
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,349
The Lorians and the Floaters.

268
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,338
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

269
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,571
That cock's high king for three seconds
and it all goes to shit.

270
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,239
I need to send a bunny to Idri.

271
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,237
Yeah, I'll send one
to that Stone bitch.

272
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,068
Wait, what about the Key?

273
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,528
Q, you just told us.

274
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,535
Fillory is getting spit-roasted
by invading forces.

275
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,991
Without us.

276
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:18,625
Okay, can I say something obvious,
yet potentially controversial?

277
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,207
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

278
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,417
Says who?

279
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,547
Fillory, when they
overthrew you.

280
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,550
- Mmm.
- Well, they were misguided,

281
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,597
and scared,
and they needed scapegoats.

282
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,597
At some point, you either have
to choose to follow through

283
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:37,478
on something,
or just, well, die.

284
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,981
Look, we chose this.

285
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,189
You captain the Key Quest,
Coldwater, and we'll stop war.

286
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:49,197
Ooh, ooh, could you drop us off
at Whitespire after it gets dark?

287
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,653
They have that balcony.

288
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,455
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

289
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,407
It would be dope.

290
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,462
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,
'cause this boat don't do complete stops.

291
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,008
Yes, once fairies
lived on Earth.

292
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,465
But not in hundreds of years.

293
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,143
Not since we fled to Fillory
because human Magicians

294
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,142
nearly hunted us
into extinction.

295
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,393
I had no idea.

296
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,725
Of course not.

297
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,520
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

298
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,318
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:32,574
So you'll understand my disbelief then
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

300
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,327
with tales of a lost tribe
that can't exist.

301
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,895
- But they're not...
- I've heard enough.

302
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,000
Wait.

303
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,166
You're not listening.

304
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,418
I'd rather remove your tongue.

305
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,000
Maybe your teeth.

306
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,594
You choose.

307
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,044
Go ahead.

308
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,347
You have already taken
so much from me.

309
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,049
What's a few teeth?

310
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,601
You've got two sentences.

311
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,352
Choose wisely.

312
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,690
I hate fairies.

313
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,366
So why would I come here,
to a place where you stole my toes

314
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,240
and I lost my child,
if it wasn't true?

315
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,365
Then why would you do this
for me?

316
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,541
It's not for you.

317
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,493
- It's for them.
- They're still fairies.

318
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,078
But they're nothing like you.

319
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,505
They're more like
traumatized children.

320
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,334
And as a mother,
despite what you did to me,

321
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,420
they deserve a chance to live.

322
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,925
So get off your...

323
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:38,268
Whatever it is fairies have
for rear butts, and do something.

324
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,516
They need their queen.

325
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,463
What part of the Library is
"Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

326
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,508
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

327
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,631
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

328
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:16,557
Uh, it's some weird
research division

329
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,804
that the Library made
in partnership with the people

330
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,262
who run the Underworld.

331
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,642
Librarians like us aren't even
allowed to go in there.

332
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,562
What the hell do they do
to these people?

333
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,693
Oh, it's like primal therapy for
people who are about to move on.

334
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,776
You go and unload your bullshit
and it lightens your conscience.

335
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,486
I'm sure my dad's
was a nightmare.

336
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,323
This is all part of that "Underworld is
a way station" shit?

337
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,216
Yeah, they, like, jot down
everything of note,

338
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,368
and then at the end you get
a metrocard out of here.

339
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,296
You're telling me there's a subway
out of the Underworld?

340
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,624
Well, it's more like
this giant, long,

341
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,461
pig-type creature that you,
like, climb into,

342
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,532
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

343
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,297
Why the hell are we still here?

344
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,871
Why haven't we hijacked
that long pig?

345
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,913
Because it only shows up when
someone has a metro card

346
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,519
and is ready to move on.

347
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,316
Our contracts will never
let us move on.

348
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,269
Nobody's ever gonna give us
metrocards, Penny.

349
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,863
Not like them.

350
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,451
Okay, so in this chapter

351
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,454
the daughter,
she finally becomes the knight

352
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,457
that she set out to be,
and right after she's knighted,

353
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,587
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back. Uh...

354
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,676
- What're you doing?
- Guys, guys.

355
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,381
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

356
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,343
The book says the moonlight has to
hit three keystones to reveal the key.

357
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,679
There's three doors, three keystones,
and none of them are near a window.

358
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,639
Okay, so we set up some mirrors,

359
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,441
and bounce around some moonlight,
and then we're back on track,

360
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,609
Enjoying the Quest?

361
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,965
Yeah, if that's what
the book says.

362
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,355
You know it does.

363
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,905
Hey.

364
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,359
Look, it's a perfect metaphor
for your relationship.

365
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,449
Not ready to laugh...
Yet. That's fine.

366
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,125
You want me
to put on a slave collar?

367
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,371
It's the only way we can get yo
in direct contact with Irene's fairies.

368
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,706
Or I could just cut off
all the McAllistairs' heads.

369
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,884
For all we know, the McAllistairs can
trigger the collars remotely.

370
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,461
And just like that...

371
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,672
Every collared fairy
will be dead.

372
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,257
We need to be stealth. Smart.

373
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,717
Tell me,

374
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,395
what's smart about
rendering myself defenseless

375
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,521
and then entrusting my life
to a powerless Magician?

376
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,750
You're god-touched.

377
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,757
That's one way to put it.

378
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,423
But it also means
I can protect you.

379
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,003
It doesn't mean
that I trust you.

380
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,638
I get it. For good reason.

381
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,887
Why would you trust
any human on Earth?

382
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,811
But Fen and I are
risking our lives.

383
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,479
So we need you to trust us.

384
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,646
Or don't.

385
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,517
And we can just do this
on our own.

386
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,818
Without you.

387
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,485
She's right.

388
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,986
I'm not sure how,
but we will find a way.

389
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,739
What is it that you want
from us?

390
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,660
Not sure I understand.

391
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,956
She's healing
a mother's wound, but you...

392
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,375
Why go so far, Julia?

393
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,956
Let's just say being god-touched
is a mixed bag.

394
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,633
But I choose to do something
with that.

395
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,585
It means something.

396
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,845
Helping those fairies,
saving them, with you.

397
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,391
And this collar.

398
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,486
This had better work.

399
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,824
She really is stunning.

400
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,701
How many more of them are there?

401
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,157
Hard to say, really.

402
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,787
They're not all that friendly.

403
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,836
And where did you say
your friend is from again?

404
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,922
The Midwest.

405
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,793
No, I mean what town is she...

406
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,054
Excuse me.

407
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,517
Fairly well-behaved, actually,
considering she's feral.

408
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,398
Guess I got lucky, huh?

409
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:40,237
Uh, that's a much faster
turnaround than we agreed on.

410
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,027
You know what, it'll be a push,

411
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,734
but I think I can get
it to you all by then.

412
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,660
The others will take
some convincing...

413
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,099
Looks like we're
working through dinner.

414
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,739
You know what to do with her.

415
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,952
Especially if time
is against us.

416
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,880
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

417
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,673
But we'll talk later?

418
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,547
About the other fairies?

419
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,968
Of course.

420
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,138
Shit.

421
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,807
It's true.

422
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,690
What Julia said. You're real.

423
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,565
You're a queen.

424
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,908
She's a queen.

425
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,119
Of the free fairies.

426
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,793
Never bow your head.

427
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,086
For anyone.

428
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:35,136
Collar breaker, collar breaker,
where are you?

429
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,575
Ready the chair.
I need to check the equipment.

430
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,777
Yes, sir.

431
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,164
They're saying
they want everything.

432
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,681
Our entire supply.

433
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,681
Look, I know that it sounds risky,
but there is a limited time to this offer.

434
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,763
- If we don't...
- Risky? No.

435
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,974
Reckless. Leave us.

436
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,941
Though we've been
separated by time and great distance,

437
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,114
we are the same.

438
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,909
We are spun
from divine inspiration.

439
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,611
Blessed.

440
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,574
We are the living embodiment
of magic.

441
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,250
I may have secured a new source.

442
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,078
Of fairies? How?

443
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,038
Ask Edwin. He's seen her.

444
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,466
So I've come to restore
your strength.

445
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:54,841
To help you understand
the glory of who you are.

446
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,223
Your suffering is my suffering.

447
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:02,682
Your injustice, mine.

448
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,812
- Where is Edwin?
- Edwin?

449
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,518
Edwin is working.

450
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,115
And when we are finally free,

451
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,666
we are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

452
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,244
gouge out their eyes,
cut out their tongues,

453
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:28,048
and hang them
by their own entrails.

454
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,723
You may feel a pinch,
but if you relax,

455
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,145
it'll be brief.

456
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,991
You want us to pull back
our advancements on Fillory?

457
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,197
This is ridiculous.

458
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,120
All we're really asking is
that you pause the invasion.

459
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,702
You both know that the only reason
Eliot and I

460
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,755
are in this mess is because
of fairy meddling bullshit.

461
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,027
And as soon as we clear this up
with the people of Fillory...

462
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,794
Deposed rulers don't get
their thrones back.

463
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,173
They exile themselves.

464
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,880
Or die at the hands of the mob.

465
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,966
Is this how you talk
to all your allies?

466
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,220
"Allies"?

467
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,973
My dear, I have yet to see
any proof that your marriage

468
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,770
to my son was ever
even consummated.

469
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,725
I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

470
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,060
Are you sure that wasn't
from the toad bite?

471
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,071
You saw it?

472
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,989
Of course I did. I'm his mother.

473
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,989
Wow, that's a lot to process.

474
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,164
In any case, I have no faith in
either of you reclaiming your thrones.

475
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,367
We will continue
our advancement on Fillory.

476
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,373
I'm afraid Loria declines
as well.

477
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,331
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

478
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:54,043
It makes no sense to withdraw
when I know we'll succeed.

479
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,344
I have to do what's best
for my people.

480
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,343
And what about our engagement?

481
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,971
You're no longer king, Eliot.

482
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,427
So it's no longer valid.

483
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:09,270
King Idri, are you saying you have
yet to take a husband?

484
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,147
My son's marble
has yet to be polished.

485
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,399
You mossy, pimping bitch.

486
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,857
Will you excuse us
for two seconds?

487
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,069
As much as I would love
to roll your smother-in-law

488
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,406
off our boat, it won't prevent either
one of them from invading Fillory.

489
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,603
We need to split those
two up before your man's arranged

490
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,244
to marry my child bride.

491
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,455
And our best plan is...

492
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,177
We offer them magic.

493
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,760
What the...

494
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,184
Fen!

495
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,981
I just watched him help
kill a fairy.

496
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,811
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

497
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,896
just a machine that removes
their heads.

498
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,150
What?

499
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,116
All right, we just need to
figure something out.

500
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,534
There's nothing.

501
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,078
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

502
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:10,161
Wait, the magic that controls
the collars, they're fairy deals?

503
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,298
Edwin said you're the oldest
of the fairies.

504
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,922
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

505
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,092
Yes.

506
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,845
How could you do that
to your own people?

507
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,893
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

508
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,937
out of existence nearly.

509
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,436
Then my Queen found passage
to a new world.

510
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,315
Several of us volunteered to
bind ourselves to the collars

511
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,021
and the McAllistairs.

512
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,483
A deal that would keep them
from following.

513
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,911
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

514
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,455
But as my generation died,

515
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,876
and younger generations
were born into this life,

516
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,625
I lost faith in that sacrifice.

517
00:27:54,715 --> 00:28:00,336
Or in the belief that my Queen
had made it to the other side.

518
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,795
She did.

519
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,556
My mother, your Queen,
led us to Fillory, where I was born.

520
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,188
And we were able
to create a home there.

521
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,311
All because of your sacrifice.

522
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,071
You never should have come.

523
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,659
Because now you can never
go back.

524
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,668
There is a way to break
a fairy deal, isn't there?

525
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,040
It doesn't matter.

526
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,122
"Doesn't matter"?

527
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,502
Of course it does.

528
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,504
I will not do it.

529
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:46,883
Our deals are the foundation
of our culture and key to our survival.

530
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,801
You are their queen.

531
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,516
You came here to save them.

532
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,188
If you don't, what's the point?

533
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,023
Fairies are known
for honoring their deals.

534
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,981
When we break them,
we lose the people's trust

535
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,570
and our limited leverage,
which we need for survival.

536
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,907
Without that, we are weak
and vulnerable.

537
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,040
It would be better for all of us
for me to take it to the grave.

538
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,586
Which will be soon enough!

539
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,255
Against the wall.

540
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,000
Dust, we're on a schedule.

541
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,137
Do not go with him.

542
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,063
What did I just say?

543
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,015
I won't let you do this.

544
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,983
I do not have time for this.

545
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,362
Stop! No!

546
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,596
What the fuck?

547
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,579
You guarantee
that this is the best decision

548
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,331
- for our family?
- I guarantee it.

549
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,459
Do not make me regret
my decision, Irene.

550
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,462
Oh, Vincent, when have I ever
steered this family wrong?

551
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,713
Cheers.

552
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,261
To us. To a new future. Cheers.

553
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,232
Shit.

554
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:47,437
It seems like those Secrets
dicks really made you earn it.

555
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:51,241
Any idea where you're going
now that you're moving on?

556
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,443
No, they...
They didn't really say.

557
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,369
Well, who'd you talk to?

558
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,367
Was it Fran? Oh, she's...

559
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,744
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and...

560
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,374
Never really know which one
to focus on 'cause they're both moving.

561
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,749
I... I had, uh...

562
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,706
I couldn't really see
his face under his hood,

563
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,419
but he had...
He had glowing red eyes.

564
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,296
- Oh.
- What... What does that mean?

565
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:19,052
Oh, you must have done some
horrible shit in your time.

566
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,389
Wait, wait...
Uh, where am I going?

567
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,689
Is it hell?

568
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,148
If only.

569
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,740
At least hell is warm.

570
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,109
There's a place worse than hell?

571
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:40,244
Oh, and way more creative with what they
plug all of your openings up with.

572
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,744
I'm not ready.

573
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,701
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

574
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,710
Hello, Penny.

575
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,261
Let's chat.

576
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,679
I've missed this.

577
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,762
But it doesn't change anything.

578
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,020
You know what Margo's doing
right now?

579
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,274
She's convincing the Stone Queen
that we'll get magic back.

580
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,775
Because we will.

581
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,653
And she's threatening her
with it.

582
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,703
If I'm lying,
invade later and kill me.

583
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,826
But if I'm not,
do you really wanna fight

584
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,955
righteously pissed off Magicians
who can finger-blast

585
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:29,210
your entire army
into fucking compost?

586
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,750
And is that
your strategy as well,

587
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,255
to threaten me?

588
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,466
I'd be well within my rights,

589
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,798
given that your army
is about to attack us.

590
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,305
But, no,
I'm not threatening you.

591
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,185
I am promising you...

592
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,267
What, exactly?

593
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,603
<i>On the off-chance this is true,</i>

594
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,313
what're your plans for taking back
control of the thrones?

595
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:59,744
Once we give back magic to the people,
we won't have to take anything.

596
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,698
Hell, they'll be begging us
to take back our thrones.

597
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:08,332
Our Magicians can identify
anyone with magical talent.

598
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,215
And it's likely that many of
your people have it

599
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,543
without the education
to know it.

600
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,343
So we'll educate them.

601
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,848
Soon you could have magic
as powerful as ours.

602
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,360
I usually like to keep
a certain amount of distance

603
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,240
between myself
and the residents,

604
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,368
but you are just
so fucking fascinating.

605
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,790
What?

606
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,493
I've never seen anyone
fight their destiny so hard

607
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,706
while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

608
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,836
I mean,
you narrowly escaped death.

609
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,042
Twice.

610
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,429
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

611
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,846
Who does that?

612
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,891
Yeah, I still have no idea
who you are.

613
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,093
Hades.

614
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,638
"Hades."

615
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,064
Like the god?

616
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,266
Shh!

617
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,602
I told you, low profile.

618
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,741
Okay, so what the hell
are you doing talking to me?

619
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,193
Look, is this about the metro...

620
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,698
No, it's not about that.

621
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,950
It's much more big picture.

622
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,750
Let's talk about your future
as a Librarian.

623
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,293
Or not.

624
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,962
This is about that quest,
isn't it?

625
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,416
Let me tell you something
about that.

626
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,422
It doesn't matter.

627
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,719
Easy for a god to say.

628
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,890
Spoiler alert,
magic always comes back.

629
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,593
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

630
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,555
verging on the brink
of extinction, but it will.

631
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,766
Because ultimately,

632
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,944
magic's a carrot gods use
to keep humans in check.

633
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,697
It's a lot to take in, I know.

634
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:03,777
My point is,
your life as a human,

635
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,613
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

636
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:12,452
This quest, your friends...
In a thousand years,

637
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,332
hazy at best.

638
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,505
Your life starts now,
after death.

639
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,545
And, yes, I realize
the phrasing is confusing.

640
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,756
Okay, what... What is this?

641
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,135
Is this some kind of fucked-up

642
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,578
punishment for stealing
a metrocard?

643
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,602
Hardly.

644
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,818
There are a lot of places
you could've ended up

645
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,583
that aren't nearly as nice
as the Underworld.

646
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,350
Shackled to a trolley
reshelving books?

647
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,481
We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

648
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,654
with almost an eternity
to explore it.

649
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,154
And if you want the shackles off,
go to Howard.

650
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,453
So I have to join a book club
to free myself?

651
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,498
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

652
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,666
and be part of something.

653
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:57,998
You've got that whole loner thing,
but it's obviously a front.

654
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,834
Ever since that trip to Savannah
with your real mom,

655
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,793
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

656
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,504
Yeah, okay,
you and everyone else down here

657
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,576
that's read my book, what,
you just think you know me?

658
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,934
But it's why you're always
sacrificing yourself for people, right?

659
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,017
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

660
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,566
If you're that desperate to
move on and maybe somehow

661
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,860
fumble your way
back to your old life,

662
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,063
I won't stop you.

663
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,945
But I'm telling you, Penny,

664
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,403
if you stay down here,

665
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,489
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

666
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,909
You've just gotta
choose it first.

667
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,644
And that should be
the last keystone, right?

668
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,062
I don't understand.

669
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,605
Would you stop...

670
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,926
You keep acting
like this is your book.

671
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,488
Maybe 'cause I've been on the quest for
more than two minutes...

672
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,912
Guys, snoop-and-poop voices.
Please.

673
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,830
You're hiding something from me.

674
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,644
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

675
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,751
Guys, seriously, I just got out of
a fantasy prison,

676
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,315
and I don't wanna end up
in a real one.

677
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,956
Are you working for the Library?

678
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,586
Yes.

679
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,588
Surprisingly honest. That's...

680
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,089
Are you trying to stop us?

681
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,591
No.

682
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,797
They wanna help us.

683
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,202
They want magic back
as badly as you do.

684
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,593
Well, I find that
a little hard to believe,

685
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,848
given what they did to Harriet
and Victoria and Penny.

686
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,556
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about Victoria?

687
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,192
You're welcome.

688
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:52,696
Yeah, you boned me,
but you also saved my life.

689
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:58,622
And I left you alone
when I shouldn't have.

690
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,467
Christ, okay, just go see
your family already...

691
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,633
No, I... I don't...
I don't understand.

692
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,166
What's to understand?
They helped me.

693
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,811
They wanna help us.
How is any of that bad?

694
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,979
Sorry, are you smoking
right now?

695
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:27,404
I was stoked to go on this quest
and hang with you guys, but...

696
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,659
My ex is dead, and you two are
setting my ball hairs on end.

697
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,905
I need this.

698
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,703
I'm just glad I was a genius

699
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,079
who stashed high-end party treats
all over while I was substitute high king.

700
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,674
If the Library wanted to help,
why hide it from me?

701
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,000
Why not just tell me?

702
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,585
Because I know you.

703
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,762
And I know how you'd react.
And you did.

704
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:52,964
Guys.

705
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,136
Guys.

706
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,558
Guys!

707
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,180
I know where the Sixth Key is.

708
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,144
Where?

709
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:07,190
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

710
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,943
Had it not been for you,
they'd all be dead.

711
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,566
I choose to be grateful.

712
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,953
I won't tell anyone
about what you did tonight.

713
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,040
It's too late.

714
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,119
There are consequences
to broken deals.

715
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,704
Our word will mean nothing.

716
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,039
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,965
Of all the humans that
have ever sought me out,

718
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,640
you're the only one who didn't
do it for personal gain.

719
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:42,226
If more were like you,
we might have been able to coexist.

720
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,681
We still can.

721
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,564
We could at least try.

722
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,860
You and your companions
are on a quest, correct?

723
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,407
For seven keys?

724
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,494
Yes.

725
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,614
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

726
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:06,830
But it's what created
and sustains the Fairy Realm.

727
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:13,295
Without the key, everything collapses,
which is why we can never give it to you.

728
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,435
Howard.

729
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,194
What's your stupid
book club reading?

730
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,011
Gill and Stacey.
Greatest love story ever written.

731
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:01,309
He's handsome and tough and misunderstood,
but... But with a heart of gold.

732
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:05,263
And she is a driven woman just trying
to make it in a man's world.

733
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,097
So good.

734
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,478
I'm... I'm sure it is.

735
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,686
Penny, meet Kathy.

736
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,020
Kathy, Penny.

737
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,195
'Sup?

738
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,489
He 'supped me.

739
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,360
It's just like
I always imagined.

740
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,492
Penny, try one of
Kathy's cupcakes.

741
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,165
I promise you won't regret it.
