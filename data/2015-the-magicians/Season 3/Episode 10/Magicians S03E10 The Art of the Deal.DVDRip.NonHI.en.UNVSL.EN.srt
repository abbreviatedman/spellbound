1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,445
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,630
<i>I'm a Librarian.</i>

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,105
<i>Currently on the lam
from a billion-year contract.</i>

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,766
Sylvia, what'd you do?

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,841
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,821
Just let me see it again. - No.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,246
Not till you tell me what
you were doing in the Library.

8
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,443
I'm stuck in the Fairy
Realm. How can I see you?

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,783
<i>Lets you see into
other worlds, it's rad.</i>

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,290
You're the absolute worst
rulers Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,121
Honey, you don't
have to listen to Tick.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,336
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,694
Turn around, head
home, relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,460
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,198
<i>This magic.</i>

16
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,297
I mean, it looks
different. It feels different.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,671
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,301
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,471
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,310
<i>to snort so they
can do magic tricks.</i>

21
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,373
I wanna help you
get out of here.

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,208
The necklace.

23
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,755
It kills them when
they use magic.

24
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,756
So you're just okay with letting
Kady take the Fifth Key, huh?

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,557
I'm not letting her do anything.

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,973
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,556
Hey, Kady, I...

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,033
<i>Please leave a
message at the tone.</i>

29
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,362
Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

30
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,371
Look, she probably
took it because...

31
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,378
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

32
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,707
At least I know what Kady wants.

33
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,374
What does that mean?

34
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,680
She wants to talk to Penny.

35
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,549
But you, I don't...

36
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,298
First, you don't wanna
help us with the quest.

37
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:32,384
Then, suddenly, you want magic
so badly that you nearly kill yourself.

38
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,394
That's not fair.

39
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,521
None of that is fair.

40
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,589
Okay, well, then what is it?

41
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,963
Do you...

42
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,128
Are you with us? Do
you want magic back?

43
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,662
Of course I want magic.

44
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,404
Okay, well, then what changed?

45
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,476
Why now?

46
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,908
As opposed to when, huh?

47
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,415
When you asked me if I
wanted to go on a quest

48
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,917
five minutes after my dad died?

49
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,422
Would you be ready to
go on a fucking adventure?

50
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,979
Alice, I'm just...

51
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,355
You know, and are you the
only one who's allowed to be

52
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,417
ambivalent and depressive and...

53
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,087
And scared and hate themselves?

54
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,599
But I just have to be
sure of everything, huh?

55
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,066
Fuck you, Quentin.

56
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,438
Uh... Sorry.

57
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,475
I was just trying
to get through.

58
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,668
Sorry.

59
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,407
We can fight about
this after the quest.

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,346
Just let me see the stupid book.

61
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,824
Whoa.

62
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,958
There's something
she's not telling me.

63
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,472
You really think it was a
good idea to give her the book?

64
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,972
I don't know.

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,838
She helped us with the last key.

66
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,470
And we're probably gonna
need her for the next one, so...

67
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,417
The book says that the Sixth Key

68
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,646
is in the Throne
Room at Whitespire.

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,416
Oh, shit.

70
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,928
Wait, that's where
Margo and Eliot...

71
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,619
Just got overthrown violently?

72
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,752
Yeah.

73
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,227
I need an aspirin.

74
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,378
Thank you.

75
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,407
I'll never take magic
for granted again.

76
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,850
Yeah.

77
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,547
Me neither.

78
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,852
Uh, look,

79
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,520
there's something I have to
finish here before I can leave.

80
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,460
I can't go knowing
that the fairies are...

81
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,727
Jules, do what you gotta do.

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,735
Just be careful, okay?

83
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,929
You too.

84
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,506
Okay, so Skye's telling the
others what happened to her

85
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,042
and that we wanna
help them escape.

86
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,704
But that can't happen until
we get their necklaces off.

87
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,514
There's an emoji of a dagger.

88
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,814
Todd was right, this truly
is the universal language.

89
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,114
I need you to focus.

90
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,645
I can't find anything on these necklaces,
and I need to know how they work.

91
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,191
Can't you see I'm busy?

92
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,226
Fen.

93
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,661
Look, I know what the fairies
did to you in Fillory was fucked up.

94
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,562
And I'm sorry about that, but...

95
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,998
Yeah...

96
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,399
That's my response.

97
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,570
Is that a gif of a
crab with a knife?

98
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,667
It's how I feel.

99
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,680
Is it "gif" or "jif"?

100
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,845
Please. I need your help.

101
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,518
Fairies just make my skin crawl.

102
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,786
Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

103
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,889
So what you're saying is
that you want a fairy necklace

104
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,899
to examine? Yes.

105
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,596
One that isn't already
attached to a fairy's neck.

106
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,935
Fine, but don't
expect me to pretend

107
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,474
like I don't hate fairies.

108
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,803
You don't have to.

109
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,639
We know about your fairies.

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,478
There's one
standing right there.

111
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,517
Fen's family had a problem with
them, so I'm trying to help fix it.

112
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,616
I hate them. Their black eyes.

113
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,287
Their long fingers.
Their mushrooms.

114
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,693
"Mushrooms"?

115
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,288
They make the
air thick and musty,

116
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,959
like a bear's undercarriage.

117
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,936
And what was the deal that
you made with these fairies?

118
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,631
Oh, I didn't make a deal.

119
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,298
One was made for
me by... By her family.

120
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,604
See, they were tricked.

121
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,008
Interesting.

122
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,974
And here I thought that the
fairies under my protection

123
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,538
were the last of their kind.

124
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,947
I wish.

125
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,609
They're everywhere
in Fil... Fillmore.

126
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,017
Fillmore.

127
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,648
It's, um... It's a small
farming town in the Midwest.

128
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,952
And what about you, Julia?

129
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,322
How is it that you can see them?

130
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,703
I made a deal with
a younger fairy.

131
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,787
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

132
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,863
And just how
young was this fairy?

133
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,834
I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

134
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,667
Which is why we
wanted to ask you,

135
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,931
how are the ones here,

136
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,738
you know, so docile?

137
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:22,844
Well, I assume that you've noticed that
all of my fairies have this silver collar.

138
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,077
You mean, their necklace?

139
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,644
Necklaces, yeah.

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,848
They are cute, aren't they?

141
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,824
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

142
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,887
You'll need one.

143
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,759
You can get it from
my Uncle Edwin.

144
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,129
But I'm gonna need
something in return.

145
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,065
Of course. If your
rash is back...

146
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,865
I'll need you to
bring me a fairy.

147
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,899
Penny, during orientation,

148
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,405
weren't you trained on how to
properly reshelve the books?

149
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,202
We got a billion years, Howard.

150
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,243
Just keeping shit interesting.

151
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,608
So, uh, Penny.

152
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,645
My book club is looking
for new members.

153
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,119
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

154
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,282
Why? 'Cause I'm brown?

155
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,726
And shackled?

156
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,138
You know this looks
bad for the Library, right?

157
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,654
Oh, no. We are not...

158
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,860
We shackle people of
all races and colors here.

159
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,698
Not better, Howard.

160
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,431
What I meant was...

161
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,234
I read your book. The hell?

162
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,902
I had unresolved feelings about
my death and your hand in it.

163
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,208
You killed yourself.

164
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,159
Am I misremembering the
part where you handed me

165
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,048
the cursed book that
directly led to that?

166
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,789
So the least you can
do is join my book club.

167
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,790
Kathy always brings
cupcakes. They're amazing.

168
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,759
Fuck off, Howard.

169
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,797
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

170
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,126
Give it a think.

171
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,800
Fasten it around
the neck to activate it.

172
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,069
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

173
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,508
Should deter them
from even trying.

174
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,511
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

175
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,776
Oh, I'm sure I'll
figure something out.

176
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,583
So, how does it work?

177
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,981
I mean, what's it powered
by? Considering there's...

178
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,784
That would be a family secret.

179
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:48,193
Okay. Uh, but... Once it's
on, how will I know it's secure?

180
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,494
Has a fairy ever
broken out of one?

181
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,791
Dust.

182
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,230
This is Dust.

183
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,331
I've had him since I was 16.

184
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,807
But he's been in the
family much longer.

185
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
How long?

186
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,442
Over 400 years, sir.

187
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,540
He may not look it, but
he's our oldest Fairy.

188
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,053
Tell Irene her
guest has a collar.

189
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,683
Yes, sir.

190
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,187
There's really only one
way to take them off.

191
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,785
I have a machine that does it.

192
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,262
So don't worry, they're secure.

193
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,393
Great.

194
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,537
Thank you so much
for all your help.

195
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,310
Today is not my day.

196
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,057
I get that you're mad,
okay? But just hear me out.

197
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,073
Okay? You turned me in, Sylvia.

198
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,781
Look, when magic went out,

199
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,430
shit got really bad up
there for my family, okay?

200
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:52,154
My... My brothers, my... My
uncles, my dad, they all got whacked.

201
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,318
And went where?

202
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,960
To the Underworld?
Where you are?

203
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,228
All my people are
up there, Sylvia.

204
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,427
I can't travel, I
can't astral project,

205
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,595
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

206
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,606
My family isn't in the
Underworld, Penny.

207
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,240
They moved on.

208
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,505
To where?

209
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,243
I mean, I'm not sure.

210
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,250
The Underworld is
just a way station, really.

211
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:22,346
You hang around for a bit, and then
the bureaucracies that be move you on.

212
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,085
But I don't know
what or where that is.

213
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,386
So your family just left you?

214
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,158
Yeah, Dad's always
sucked at waiting,

215
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,826
so he pulled some
strings and cut the line.

216
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,426
But these contracts that
we sign with the Library

217
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,837
are fucking ironclad,
so I can't go anywhere

218
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,932
until I finish my billion years.

219
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,443
When the Library
put a bounty on you,

220
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,243
it brought me a million years
closer to my family, Penny.

221
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,839
And I'm sorry.

222
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,360
I know that that
doesn't fix anything...

223
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,613
Yeah, you're right.

224
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,954
It fixes shit.

225
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,288
I spoke to a few of the others.

226
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,796
They don't believe me.

227
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:10,360
If I hadn't done the magic, if
I hadn't felt what happened,

228
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,073
I don't think I would
believe me either.

229
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,630
Okay, Skye.

230
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,198
You've got to keep trying.

231
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,371
How? What should I say?

232
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,849
Look, I don't know, but I found
a way to take off the collars.

233
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,510
Edwin's got a
machine in the lab.

234
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:29,078
It won't matter. They're scared.

235
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,319
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

236
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,556
But... There is one more thing.

237
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,323
Several of Ms. Irene's
family have arrived.

238
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,430
Many of them
brought their fairies.

239
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,560
To Brakebills?

240
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,061
Why?

241
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,231
I don't know.

242
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,399
Skye.

243
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,668
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,868
It's okay.

245
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,879
If Skye can't convince them
to run, what are we gonna do?

246
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,715
We introduce them
to someone scarier.

247
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,958
I'm on a flying boat!

248
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:10,190
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

249
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,030
Where Tick's waiting with a serrated
spoon to just saw off our heads?

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Tick isn't at
Whitespire, though.

251
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,298
He's up north, near Loria.

252
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,965
The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

253
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,564
So the book says
that the Sixth Key

254
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,201
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half-moons,

255
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,905
which is a thing that
happens in Fillory.

256
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,541
Like two black and
white cookies split apart

257
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,519
to form one giant white cookie.

258
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,452
A cookie moon.

259
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,588
Mmm-hmm.

260
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,320
Anyway, so it... It's gonna be super
bright, um, and it happens tonight, so...

261
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,592
Wait, why is Tick up near Loria?

262
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,224
Fillory's at war. What?

263
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,461
The fuck?

264
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,027
I know, we are literally questing
through a war-torn country.

265
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,368
So epic.

266
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,408
And who exactly
are we at war with?

267
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,376
The Lorians and the Floaters.

268
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,355
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

269
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,577
That cock's high king for three
seconds and it all goes to shit.

270
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,242
I need to send a bunny to Idri.

271
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,252
Yeah, I'll send one
to that Stone bitch.

272
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,083
Wait, what about the Key?

273
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,554
Q, you just told us

274
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,558
Fillory is getting spit-roasted
by invading forces.

275
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,025
Without us.

276
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,622
Okay, can I say something
obvious, yet potentially controversial?

277
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,224
We are no longer the
Kings and Queens of Fillory.

278
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,428
Says who?

279
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,562
Fillory, when they
overthrew you.

280
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,568
Mmm. Well, they were misguided,

281
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,609
and scared, and they
needed scapegoats.

282
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,612
At some point, you either
have to choose to follow through

283
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,515
on something,
or just, well, die.

284
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,985
Look, we chose this.

285
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:45,219
You captain the Key Quest,
Coldwater, and we'll stop war.

286
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,228
Ooh, ooh, could you drop us off
at Whitespire after it gets dark?

287
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,695
They have that balcony.

288
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,460
We could just rappel
down into the Throne Room.

289
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,434
It would be dope.

290
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,462
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,
'cause this boat don't do complete stops.

291
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,012
Yes, once fairies
lived on Earth.

292
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,483
But not in hundreds of years.

293
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,147
Not since we fled to Fillory
because human Magicians

294
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,157
nearly hunted
us into extinction.

295
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,419
I had no idea.

296
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,721
Of course not.

297
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,523
Short memory is a
privilege of the oppressor.

298
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,326
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,600
So you'll understand my disbelief then
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

300
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,336
with tales of a lost
tribe that can't exist.

301
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,849
But they're not...
I've heard enough.

302
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,003
Wait.

303
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,178
You're not listening.

304
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,444
I'd rather remove your tongue.

305
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,008
Maybe your teeth.

306
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,610
You choose.

307
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,053
Go ahead.

308
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,354
You have already
taken so much from me.

309
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,053
What's a few teeth?

310
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,626
You've got two sentences.

311
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,361
Choose wisely.

312
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,695
I hate fairies.

313
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:10,369
So why would I come here, to
a place where you stole my toes

314
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,244
and I lost my child,
if it wasn't true?

315
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,376
Then why would
you do this for me?

316
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,544
It's not for you.

317
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,520
It's for them.
They're still fairies.

318
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,078
But they're nothing like you.

319
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,523
They're more like
traumatized children.

320
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,356
And as a mother, despite
what you did to me,

321
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,420
they deserve a chance to live.

322
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,932
So get off your...

323
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,260
Whatever it is fairies have for
rear butts, and do something.

324
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,533
They need their queen.

325
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,460
What part of the Library is
"Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

326
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,531
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

327
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,628
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

328
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:16,572
Uh, it's some weird
research division

329
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,838
that the Library made in
partnership with the people

330
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,278
who run the Underworld.

331
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,646
Librarians like us aren't
even allowed to go in there.

332
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,579
What the hell do they
do to these people?

333
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,716
Oh, it's like primal therapy for
people who are about to move on.

334
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,785
You go and unload your bullshit
and it lightens your conscience.

335
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,490
I'm sure my dad's
was a nightmare.

336
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,328
This is all part of that
"Underworld is a way station" shit?

337
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,199
Yeah, they, like, jot
down everything of note,

338
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,397
and then at the end you
get a metrocard out of here.

339
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,304
You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

340
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,639
Well, it's more
like this giant, long,

341
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,475
pig-type creature that
you, like, climb into,

342
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,524
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

343
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,312
Why the hell are we still here?

344
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,874
Why haven't we
hijacked that long pig?

345
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,929
Because it only shows up
when someone has a metro card

346
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,512
and is ready to move on.

347
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,327
Our contracts will
never let us move on.

348
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,261
Nobody's ever gonna
give us metrocards, Penny.

349
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,866
Not like them.

350
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,470
Okay, so in this chapter

351
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,477
the daughter, she
finally becomes the knight

352
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,480
that she set out to be, and
right after she's knighted,

353
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,575
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back. Uh...

354
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,681
What're you doing? Guys, guys.

355
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,384
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

356
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:42,360
The book says the moonlight has to
hit three keystones to reveal the key.

357
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,694
There's three doors, three keystones,
and none of them are near a window.

358
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,666
Okay, so we set up some mirrors,

359
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,464
and bounce around some moonlight,
and then we're back on track,

360
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,629
Enjoying the Quest?

361
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,981
Yeah, if that's
what the book says.

362
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,371
You know it does.

363
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,931
Hey.

364
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,375
Look, it's a perfect
metaphor for your relationship.

365
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,480
Not ready to laugh...
Yet. That's fine.

366
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,110
You want me to put
on a slave collar?

367
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,382
It's the only way we can get you
in direct contact with Irene's fairies.

368
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,721
Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

369
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,887
For all we know, the McAllistairs
can trigger the collars remotely.

370
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,487
And just like that...

371
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,691
Every collared
fairy will be dead.

372
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,257
We need to be stealth. Smart.

373
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,735
Tell me,

374
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,399
what's smart about
rendering myself defenseless

375
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,501
and then entrusting my
life to a powerless Magician?

376
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,761
You're god-touched.

377
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,765
That's one way to put it.

378
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,434
But it also means
I can protect you.

379
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,995
It doesn't mean
that I trust you.

380
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,642
I get it. For good reason.

381
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,904
Why would you trust
any human on Earth?

382
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,845
But Fen and I are
risking our lives.

383
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,472
So we need you to trust us.

384
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,641
Or don't.

385
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,552
And we can just
do this on our own.

386
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,814
Without you.

387
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,481
She's right.

388
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,016
I'm not sure how,
but we will find a way.

389
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,755
What is it that
you want from us?

390
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,660
Not sure I understand.

391
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,962
She's healing a
mother's wound, but you...

392
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,367
Why go so far, Julia?

393
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,973
Let's just say being
god-touched is a mixed bag.

394
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,637
But I choose to do
something with that.

395
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,612
It means something.

396
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,845
Helping those fairies,
saving them, with you.

397
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,389
And this collar.

398
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,498
This had better work.

399
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,835
She really is stunning.

400
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,704
How many more of them are there?

401
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,174
Hard to say, really.

402
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,767
They're not all that friendly.

403
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,844
And where did you say
your friend is from again?

404
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:15,938
The Midwest.

405
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,813
No, I mean what town is she...

406
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,050
Excuse me.

407
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,532
Fairly well-behaved, actually,
considering she's feral.

408
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,458
Guess I got lucky, huh?

409
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:40,234
Uh, that's a much faster
turnaround than we agreed on.

410
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,039
You know what, it'll be a push,

411
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,738
but I think I can get
it to you all by then.

412
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,677
The others will take
some convincing...

413
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,091
Looks like we're
working through dinner.

414
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,743
You know what to do with her.

415
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,946
Especially if
time is against us.

416
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,883
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

417
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,688
But we'll talk later?

418
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,558
About the other fairies?

419
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,960
Of course.

420
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,135
Shit.

421
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,810
It's true.

422
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,687
What Julia said. You're real.

423
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,591
You're a queen.

424
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,891
She's a queen.

425
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,130
Of the free fairies.

426
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,796
Never bow your head.

427
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,066
For anyone.

428
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:35,153
Collar breaker, collar
breaker, where are you?

429
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,601
Ready the chair. I need
to check the equipment.

430
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,796
Yes, sir.

431
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,200
They're saying
they want everything.

432
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,692
Our entire supply.

433
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,696
Look, I know that it sounds risky,
but there is a limited time to this offer.

434
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,789
- If we don't...
- Risky? No.

435
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,959
Reckless. Leave us.

436
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,970
Though we've been separated
by time and great distance,

437
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,133
we are the same.

438
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,906
We are spun from
divine inspiration.

439
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,640
Blessed.

440
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,616
We are the living
embodiment of magic.

441
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,244
I may have secured a new source.

442
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,084
Of fairies? How?

443
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,056
Ask Edwin. He's seen her.

444
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,458
So I've come to
restore your strength.

445
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:54,858
To help you understand
the glory of who you are.

446
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,234
Your suffering is my suffering.

447
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:02,708
Your injustice, mine.

448
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,835
Where is Edwin? Edwin?

449
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,538
Edwin is working.

450
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,118
And when we are finally free,

451
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:20,683
we are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

452
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,252
gouge out their eyes,
cut out their tongues,

453
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,028
and hang them by
their own entrails.

454
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,742
You may feel a
pinch, but if you relax,

455
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,145
it'll be brief.

456
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,022
You want us to pull back
our advancements on Fillory?

457
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,191
This is ridiculous.

458
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,131
All we're really asking is
that you pause the invasion.

459
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,728
You both know that the
only reason Eliot and I

460
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,774
are in this mess is because
of fairy meddling bullshit.

461
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,019
And as soon as we clear this
up with the people of Fillory...

462
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,808
Deposed rulers don't
get their thrones back.

463
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,177
They exile themselves.

464
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,909
Or die at the hands of the mob.

465
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,974
Is this how you talk
to all your allies?

466
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,212
"Allies"?

467
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,981
My dear, I have yet to see
any proof that your marriage

468
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,785
to my son was ever
even consummated.

469
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,759
I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

470
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,057
Are you sure that
wasn't from the toad bite?

471
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,093
You saw it?

472
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,997
Of course I did. I'm his mother.

473
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:39,004
Wow, that's a lot to process.

474
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:43,167
In any case, I have no faith in
either of you reclaiming your thrones.

475
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,370
We will continue our
advancement on Fillory.

476
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,379
I'm afraid Loria
declines as well.

477
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,348
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

478
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:54,080
It makes no sense to withdraw
when I know we'll succeed.

479
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,349
I have to do what's
best for my people.

480
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,355
And what about our engagement?

481
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,985
You're no longer king, Eliot.

482
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,427
So it's no longer valid.

483
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:09,296
King Idri, are you saying you
have yet to take a husband?

484
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:12,167
My son's marble
has yet to be polished.

485
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,399
You mossy, pimping bitch.

486
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,874
Will you excuse
us for two seconds?

487
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:21,109
As much as I would love
to roll your smother-in-law

488
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,412
off our boat, it won't prevent either
one of them from invading Fillory.

489
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,594
We need to split those two
up before your man's arranged

490
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,247
to marry my child bride.

491
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,449
And our best plan is...

492
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,196
We offer them magic.

493
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,762
What the...

494
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,204
Fen!

495
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,004
I just watched
him help kill a fairy.

496
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,841
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

497
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,904
just a machine that
removes their heads.

498
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,142
What?

499
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,144
All right, we just need
to figure something out.

500
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,517
There's nothing.

501
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,086
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

502
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:10,153
Wait, the magic that controls
the collars, they're fairy deals?

503
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,301
Edwin said you're
the oldest of the fairies.

504
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,927
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

505
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,096
Yes.

506
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,836
How could you do that
to your own people?

507
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,908
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

508
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,949
out of existence nearly.

509
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,450
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

510
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:36,319
Several of us volunteered to
bind ourselves to the collars

511
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,050
and the McAllistairs.

512
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,491
A deal that would keep
them from following.

513
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,928
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

514
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,466
But as my generation died,

515
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:51,903
and younger generations
were born into this life,

516
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,633
I lost faith in that sacrifice.

517
00:27:54,706 --> 00:28:00,373
Or in the belief that my Queen
had made it to the other side.

518
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,811
She did.

519
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:08,548
My mother, your Queen, led
us to Fillory, where I was born.

520
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,222
And we were able to
create a home there.

521
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,317
All because of your sacrifice.

522
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,063
You never should have come.

523
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:25,666
Because now you
can never go back.

524
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,671
There is a way to break
a fairy deal, isn't there?

525
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,077
It doesn't matter.

526
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,139
"Doesn't matter"?

527
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,514
Of course it does.

528
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,519
I will not do it.

529
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:46,885
Our deals are the foundation of
our culture and key to our survival.

530
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,795
You are their queen.

531
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,531
You came here to save them.

532
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,191
If you don't, what's the point?

533
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,029
Fairies are known for
honoring their deals.

534
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,007
When we break them,
we lose the people's trust

535
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,570
and our limited leverage,
which we need for survival.

536
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:11,913
Without that, we are
weak and vulnerable.

537
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:16,046
It would be better for all of us
for me to take it to the grave.

538
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,632
Which will be soon enough!

539
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,249
Against the wall.

540
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,984
Dust, we're on a schedule.

541
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,163
Do not go with him.

542
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,071
What did I just say?

543
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,042
I won't let you do this.

544
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,975
I do not have time for this.

545
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,380
Stop! No!

546
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,601
What the fuck?

547
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,614
You guarantee that
this is the best decision

548
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,365
- for our family?
- I guarantee it.

549
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:42,465
Do not make me regret
my decision, Irene.

550
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,477
Oh, Vincent, when have I
ever steered this family wrong?

551
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,739
Cheers.

552
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,247
To us. To a new future. Cheers.

553
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,232
Shit.

554
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:47,466
It seems like those Secrets
dicks really made you earn it.

555
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,237
Any idea where you're going
now that you're moving on?

556
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,471
No, they... They
didn't really say.

557
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,377
Well, who'd you talk to?

558
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,382
Was it Fran? Oh, she's...

559
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,782
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and...

560
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,379
Never really know which one to
focus on 'cause they're both moving.

561
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:04,787
I... I had, uh...

562
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,722
I couldn't really see
his face under his hood,

563
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:10,422
but he had... He
had glowing red eyes.

564
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,288
Oh. What... What does that mean?

565
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:19,070
Oh, you must have done
some horrible shit in your time.

566
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,400
Wait, wait... Uh,
where am I going?

567
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:23,703
Is it hell?

568
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,141
If only.

569
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,743
At least hell is warm.

570
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,113
There's a place worse than hell?

571
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:40,251
Oh, and way more creative with what
they plug all of your openings up with.

572
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,759
I'm not ready.

573
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,728
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

574
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,737
Hello, Penny.

575
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,272
Let's chat.

576
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,670
I've missed this.

577
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,777
But it doesn't change anything.

578
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,017
You know what
Margo's doing right now?

579
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,289
She's convincing the Stone
Queen that we'll get magic back.

580
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,790
Because we will.

581
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,690
And she's
threatening her with it.

582
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,719
If I'm lying, invade
later and kill me.

583
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,858
But if I'm not, do
you really wanna fight

584
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,960
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

585
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,201
your entire army
into fucking compost?

586
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,820
And is that your
strategy as well,

587
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,244
to threaten me?

588
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,471
I'd be well within my rights,

589
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,813
given that your army
is about to attack us.

590
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:45,314
But, no, I'm not
threatening you.

591
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,188
I am promising you...

592
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,285
What, exactly?

593
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,626
<i>On the off-chance this is true,</i>

594
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,325
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

595
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,770
Once we give back magic to the
people, we won't have to take anything.

596
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,741
Hell, they'll be begging
us to take back our thrones.

597
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,337
Our Magicians can identify
anyone with magical talent.

598
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,215
And it's likely that many
of your people have it

599
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,550
without the
education to know it.

600
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,358
So we'll educate them.

601
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,863
Soon you could have
magic as powerful as ours.

602
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,368
I usually like to keep a
certain amount of distance

603
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,243
between myself
and the residents,

604
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,375
but you are just so
fucking fascinating.

605
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,816
What?

606
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,514
I've never seen anyone
fight their destiny so hard

607
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,717
while simultaneously
propelling themselves towards it.

608
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,851
I mean, you narrowly
escaped death.

609
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,053
Twice.

610
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,429
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

611
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,863
Who does that?

612
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,902
Yeah, I still have
no idea who you are.

613
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,096
Hades.

614
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,664
"Hades."

615
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,072
Like the god?

616
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,268
Shh!

617
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,609
I told you, low profile.

618
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,744
Okay, so what the hell
are you doing talking to me?

619
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,219
Look, is this about the metro...

620
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,721
No, it's not about that.

621
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,950
It's much more big picture.

622
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,759
Let's talk about your
future as a Librarian.

623
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,296
Or not.

624
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,992
This is about
that quest, isn't it?

625
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,432
Let me tell you
something about that.

626
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,437
It doesn't matter.

627
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,733
Easy for a god to say.

628
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,901
Spoiler alert, magic
always comes back.

629
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,605
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

630
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,581
verging on the brink
of extinction, but it will.

631
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,777
Because ultimately,

632
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:56,947
magic's a carrot gods use
to keep humans in check.

633
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,716
It's a lot to take in, I know.

634
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,785
My point is, your
life as a human,

635
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,627
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

636
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:12,467
This quest, your friends...
In a thousand years,

637
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,335
hazy at best.

638
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,501
Your life starts
now, after death.

639
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,579
And, yes, I realize the
phrasing is confusing.

640
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,775
Okay, what... What is this?

641
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,147
Is this some kind of fucked-up

642
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,561
punishment for
stealing a metrocard?

643
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,585
Hardly.

644
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,827
There are a lot of places
you could've ended up

645
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,566
that aren't nearly as
nice as the Underworld.

646
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,389
Shackled to a trolley
reshelving books?

647
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,487
We're in the greatest
Library in the entire universe

648
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,657
with almost an
eternity to explore it.

649
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:44,169
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

650
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,467
So I have to join a
book club to free myself?

651
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,509
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

652
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,669
and be part of something.

653
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:58,012
You've got that whole loner
thing, but it's obviously a front.

654
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,848
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

655
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,820
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

656
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,516
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

657
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,568
that's read my book, what,
you just think you know me?

658
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,926
But it's why you're always
sacrificing yourself for people, right?

659
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,032
To remind them how
important you are to the group?

660
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,558
If you're that desperate to
move on and maybe somehow

661
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,866
fumble your way
back to your old life,

662
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,066
I won't stop you.

663
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,938
But I'm telling you, Penny,

664
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,442
if you stay down here,

665
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,506
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

666
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,912
You've just gotta
choose it first.

667
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,636
And that should be
the last keystone, right?

668
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,070
I don't understand.

669
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,609
Would you stop...

670
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,926
You keep acting
like this is your book.

671
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,510
Maybe 'cause I've been on the
quest for more than two minutes...

672
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,920
Guys, snoop-and-poop
voices. Please.

673
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,856
You're hiding something from me.

674
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,636
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

675
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,754
Guys, seriously, I just
got out of a fantasy prison,

676
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,306
and I don't wanna
end up in a real one.

677
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,959
Are you working for the Library?

678
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,592
Yes.

679
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,603
Surprisingly honest. That's...

680
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,104
Are you trying to stop us?

681
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,606
No.

682
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,800
They wanna help us.

683
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,218
They want magic back
as badly as you do.

684
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,609
Well, I find that a
little hard to believe,

685
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,874
given what they did to
Harriet and Victoria and Penny.

686
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,576
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What about Victoria?

687
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,184
You're welcome.

688
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:52,688
Yeah, you boned me,
but you also saved my life.

689
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,636
And I left you alone
when I shouldn't have.

690
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,475
Christ, okay, just go
see your family already...

691
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,647
No, I... I don't... I
don't understand.

692
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,158
What's to understand?
They helped me.

693
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,815
They wanna help us.
How is any of that bad?

694
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,994
Sorry, are you
smoking right now?

695
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:27,396
I was stoked to go on this quest
and hang with you guys, but...

696
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,670
My ex is dead, and you two
are setting my ball hairs on end.

697
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,897
I need this.

698
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,729
I'm just glad I was a genius

699
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:39,073
who stashed high-end party treats all
over while I was substitute high king.

700
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,679
If the Library wanted to
help, why hide it from me?

701
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,014
Why not just tell me?

702
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,611
Because I know you.

703
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,781
And I know how you'd
react. And you did.

704
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,949
Guys.

705
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,153
Guys.

706
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,592
Guys!

707
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,186
I know where the Sixth Key is.

708
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,122
Where?

709
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:07,205
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

710
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,935
Had it not been for
you, they'd all be dead.

711
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,574
I choose to be grateful.

712
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,942
I won't tell anyone about
what you did tonight.

713
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,046
It's too late.

714
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,145
There are consequences
to broken deals.

715
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,713
Our word will mean nothing.

716
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,053
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,991
Of all the humans that
have ever sought me out,

718
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,626
you're the only one who
didn't do it for personal gain.

719
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,231
If more were like you, we
might have been able to coexist.

720
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,707
We still can.

721
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,572
We could at least try.

722
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,879
You and your companions
are on a quest, correct?

723
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,418
For seven keys?

724
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,485
Yes.

725
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,620
We have one of the
keys in the Fairy Realm.

726
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:06,859
But it's what created and
sustains the Fairy Realm.

727
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:13,303
Without the key, everything collapses,
which is why we can never give it to you.

728
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,441
Howard.

729
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,186
What's your stupid
book club reading?

730
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:56,037
Gill and Stacey. Greatest
love story ever written.

731
00:41:56,114 --> 00:42:01,314
He's handsome and tough and misunderstood,
but... But with a heart of gold.

732
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:05,289
And she is a driven woman just
trying to make it in a man's world.

733
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,120
So good.

734
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,490
I'm... I'm sure it is.

735
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,722
Penny, meet Kathy.

736
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,059
Kathy, Penny.

737
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,190
'Sup?

738
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,493
He 'supped me.

739
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,363
It's just like I
always imagined.

740
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:22,498
Penny, try one of
Kathy's cupcakes.

741
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,168
I promise you won't regret it.
