Sylvia, what'd you do?

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,842
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,781
ALICE: Just let me see it again.
QUENTIN: No.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,223
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

8
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,454

How can I see you?

listen to Tick.

12

You can just do
your own thing.

00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,681
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,312
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,482
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

The necklace.

23
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,765
It kills them
when they use magic.

24
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,733
So you're just okay with letting
Kady take the Fifth Key, huh?

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,568
I'm not letting her
do anything.

26
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,903
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,567

Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

Look. she probably
took it because...

32
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,389
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

33
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,718
At least I know
what Kady wants.

34
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,385
What does that mean?

35
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,690
She wants to talk to Penny.

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,560
But you, I don't...

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,258
First, you don't wanna help us
with the quest.

38
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,394
Then, suddenly, you want magic so
badly that you nearly kill yourself.

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,405
That's not fair.

40
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,532
None of that is fair.

41
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,599
Okay, well,
then what is it?

42
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,939
Do you...

43
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,139
Are you with us?
Do you want magic back?

44
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,706
Of course I want magic.

45
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,415
Okay, well,
then what changed?

46
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,477
Why now?

47
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,919
As opposed to when, huh?

48
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,426
When you asked me
if I wanted to go on a quest

49
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,928
five minutes
after my dad died?

50
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,432
Would you be ready
to go on a fucking adventure?

51
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,956
Alice, I'm just...

52
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,332
You know, and are you the
only one who's allowed to be

53
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,427
ambivalent
and depressive and...

54
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,098
And scared
and hate themselves?

55
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,609

of everything, huh?

There's something
she's not telling me.

65
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,482
You really think it was a good
idea to give her the book?

66
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,983
I don't know.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,849
She helped us
with the last key.

68
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,479

her for the next one, so.-.

00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,770
Fuck off, Howard.

178
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,808
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

179
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,137
Give it a think.

180
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,811
Fasten it around the neck
to activate it.

181
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,045
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

182
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,519
Should deter them
from even trying.

183
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,521
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

184
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,786
Oh, I'm sure I'll figure
something out.

185
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,628
So, how does it work?

186
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,992
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's...

187
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,795
That would be a family secret.

188
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:48,204
Okay. Uh, but... Once it's on,
how will I know it's secure?

189
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,505
Has a fairy ever
broken out of one?

190
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,802
(CHUCKLES) Dust.

191
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,241
This is Dust.

192
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,342
I've had him since I was 16.

193
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,818
But he's been in the family
much longer.

194
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,876
How long?

195
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,418
Over 400 years, sir.

196
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,551
He may not look it,
but he's our oldest Fairy.

197
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,062
Tell Irene
her guest has a collar.

198
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,694
Yes, sir.

199
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,198
There's really only one way
to take them off.

200
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,762
I have a machine that does it.

201
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,273
So don't worry,
they're secure.

202
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,404
Great.

203
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,548
Thank you so much
for all your help.

204
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,287
Today is not my day.

205
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,949
I get that you're mad, okay?
But just hear me out.

206
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,083
Okay?
You turned me in, Sylvia.

207
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,758
Look, when magic went out,

208
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,388
shit got really bad up there
for my family, okay?

209
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:52,130
<i>My...</i> My brothers, <i>my...</i> My uncles,
my clad, they all got whacked.

210
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,363
And went where?

211
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,971
To the Underworld?
Where you are'?

212
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,239
All my people
are up there, Sylvia.

213
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,438
I can't travel,
I can't astral project,

214
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,605
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

215
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,616
My family isn't
in the Underworld, Penny.

216
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,251
They moved on.

217
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,550
To where?

218
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,447
(SIGHS)

219
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,253
I mean, I'm not sure.

220
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,261
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

221
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:22,323
You hang around for a bit, and then the
bureaucracies that be move you on.

222
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,096
But I don't know what
or where that is.

223
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,397
So your family just left you?

224
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,135
Yeah, Dad's always sucked
at waiting,

225
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,802
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

226
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,437
But these contracts that
we sign with the Library

227
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,814
are fucking ironclad,
so I can't go anywhere

228
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,943
until I finish
my billion years.

229
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,454
When the Library put
a bounty on you,

230
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,254
it brought me a million years
closer to my family, Penny.

231
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,816
And I'm sorry.

232
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,327
I know that
that doesn't fix anything...

233
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,623
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,965
It fixes shit.

235
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,299
I spoke to a few
of the others.

236
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,807
They don't believe me.

237
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:10,381
If I hadn't done the magic, if
I hadn't felt what happened,

238
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,050
I don't think
I would believe me either.

239
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,641
Okay, Skye.

240
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,186
You've got to keep trying.

241
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,348
How? What should I say?

242
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,860
Look, I don't know, but I found
a way to take off the collars.

243
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,520
Edwin's got a machine
in the lab.

244
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,065
It won't matter.
They're scared.

245
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,329
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

246
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,566
But... There is
one more thing.

247
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,334
Several of Ms. lrene's family
have arrived.

248
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,407
Many of them
brought their fairies.

249
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,571
To Brakebills?

250
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,038
Why?

251
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,208
I don't know.

252
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,376
IRENE: Skye.

253
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,679
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,879
JULIA; It's okay.

255
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,189
(SIGHS)

256
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,890
If Skye can't convince them
to run, what are we gonna do?

257
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,725
We introduce them
to someone scarier.

258
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,935
JOSH: I’m on a flying boat!

259
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:10,201
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

260
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,040
Where Tick's waiting with a serrated
spoon to just saw off our heads?

261
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,511
Tick isn't at Whitespire,
though.

262
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,275
He's up north, near Loria.

263
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,941
QUENTIN: The Throne Room is
empty, but we need to move fast.

264
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,575
<i>So</i> the book says
that the Sixth Key

265
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,211
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half moons,

266
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,915
which is a thing that happens
in Fillory.

267
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,550
Like two black and white
cookies split apart

268
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,530
to form
one giant white cookie.

269
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,463
A cookie moon.

270
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,589
Mmm-hmm.

271
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,297
Anyway, so it... It's gonna be super
bright, um, and it happens tonight, so...

272
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,603
Wait, why is Tick up
near Loria?

273
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,234
JOSH: Fillory's at war.
What?

274
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,438
The fuck?

275
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,038
I know, we are literally questing
through a war-torn country.

276
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,379
So epic.

277
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,419
And who exactly
are we at war with?

278
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,386
The Lorians
and the Floaters.

279
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,286
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

280
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,588
That cook's high king for three
seconds and it all goes to shit.

281
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,253
I need to send
a bunny to ldri.

282
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,263
Yeah, I'll send one
to that Stone bitch.

283
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,094
Wait, what about the Key?

284
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,565
Q, you just told us

285
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,569
Fillory is getting spit-roasted
by invading forces.

286
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,002
Without us.

287
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,633
Okay, can I say something obvious,
yet potentially controversial?

288
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,234
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

289
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,439
Says who?

290
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,573
Fillory, when they
overthrew you.

291
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,578
Mmm.
Well, they were misguided,

292
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,620
and scared,
and they needed scapegoats.

293
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,623
At some point, you either have
to choose to follow through

294
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,492
on something,
or just, well, die.

295
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,996
Look, we chose this.

296
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:45,194
You captain the Key Quest,
Goldwater, and we'll stop war.

297
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,205
Ooh, ooh, could you drop us off
at Whitespire after it gets dark?

298
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,672
They have that balcony.

299
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,471
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

300
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,444
It would be dope.

301
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,473
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,
'cause this boat don't do complete stops.

302
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,023
FAIRY QUEEN: Yes, once fairies
lived on Earth.

303
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,493
But not
in hundreds of years.

304
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,158
Not since we fled to Fillory
because human Magicians

305
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,168
nearly hunted us
into extinction.

306
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,396
I had no idea.

307
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,732
Of course not.

308
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,534
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

309
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,337
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,577
So you'll understand my disbelief then
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

311
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,347
with tales of a lost tribe
that can't exist.

312
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,854
But they're not...
I've heard enough.

313
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,014
Wait.

314
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,188
You're not listening.

315
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,421
I'd rather remove your tongue.

316
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,019
Maybe your teeth.

317
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,587
You choose.

318
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,064
Go ahead.

319
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:52,364
You have already taken
so much from me.

320
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,063
What's a few teeth?

321
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,603
You've got two sentences.

322
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,372
Choose wisely.

323
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,706
I hate fairies.

324
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:10,380
So why would I come here, to a
place where you stole my toes

325
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,255
and I lost my child,
if it wasn't true?

326
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,387
Then why would you do this
for me?

327
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,555
It's not for you.

328
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,530
It's for them.
They're still fairies.

329
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,089
But they're nothing like you.

330
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,533
They're more like
traumatized children.

331
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,367
And as a mother,
despite what you did to me,

332
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,430
they deserve
a chance to live.

333
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,941
So get off your...

334
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,271
Whatever it is fairies have for
rear butts, and do something.

335
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,544
They need their queen.

336
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,932
<i>(scams)</i>

337
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,471
What part of the Library is
"Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

338
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,507
Oh, so now
you're talking to me?

339
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,639
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

340
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:16,583
Uh, it's some weird
research division

341
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,815
that the Library made in
partnership with the people

342
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,289
who run the Underworld.

343
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,657
Librarians like us aren't
even allowed to go in there.

344
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,488
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

345
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,589
What the hell do they do
to these people?

346
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,693
Oh, it's like primal therapy for
people who are about to move on.

347
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,796
You go and unload your bullshit
and it lightens your conscience.

348
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,500
I’m sure my dad's

00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,339
This is all part of that "Underworld
is a way station" shit?

350
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,174
Yeah, they, like, jot down
everything of note,

351
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,373
and then at the end you get
a metrocard out of here.

352
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,314
You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

353
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,650
Well, it's more like
this giant, long,

354
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,486
pig-type creature that you,
like, climb into,

355
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,492
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

356
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,323
Why the hell
are we still here?

357
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,862
Why haven't we hijacked
that long pig?

358
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,862
Because it only shows up when
someone has a metro card

359
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,523
and is ready to move on.

the daughter, she finally
becomes the knight

366
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,491
that she set out to be, and
right after she's knighted,

367
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,586
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back. Uh...

Guys' guys.

00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,395
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so.-.

371
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:42,371
The book says the moonlight has to hit
three keystones to reveal the key.

372
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,705
There's three doors, three keystones,
and none of them are near a window.

373
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,676
Okay, so we set up
some mirrors,

374
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,441
and bounce around some moonlight,
and then we're back on track,

375

00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,910
Yeah, if that's what
the book says.

You know it does.

FAIRY QUEEN: You want me
to put on a slave collar?

383
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,393
It's the only way we can get you in
direct contact with lrene's fairies.

384
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,732
Or I could just cut off
all the McAllistairs' heads.

385
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,898
For all we know, the McAllistairs
can trigger the collars remotely.

will be dead.

what's smart about
rendering myself defenseless

391

and then entrusting my life
to a powerless Magician?

392
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,772
You're god-touched.

393
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,776
That's one way to put it.

394
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,445
But it also means
I can protect you.

395
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,006
It doesn't mean
that I trust you.

I get it. For good reason.

397

Why would you trust
any human on Earth?

398
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,821
But Fen and I are
risking our lives.

399
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,483
So we need you to trust us.

400
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,652
Or don't.

401
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,528
And we can just do this
on our own.

522
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,121
All right, we just need to
figure something out.

523
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,562
There's nothing.

524
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,097
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

525
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:10,163
Wait, the magic that controls the
collars, they're fairy deals?

526
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,312
Edwin said you're the oldest
of the fairies.

527
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,937
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

528
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,107
Yes.

529
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,847
How could you do that
to your own people?

530
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,919
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

531
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,960
out of existence nearly.

532
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,461
Then my Queen found passage
to a new world.

533
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:36,330
Several of us volunteered to
bind ourselves to the collars

534
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,025
and the McAllistairs.

535
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,502
A deal that would keep them
from following.

536
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,938
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

537
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,477
But <i>as</i> my generation died,

538
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:51,879
and younger generations
were born into this life,

539
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,644
I lost faith
in that sacrifice.

540
00:27:54,706 --> 00:28:00,349
Or in the belief that my Queen
had made it to the other side.

541
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,822
She did.

542
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:08,559
My mother, your Queen, led us
to Fillory, where I was born.

543
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,198
And we were able
to create a home there.

544
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,328
All because of
your sacrifice.

545
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,074
You never should have come.

546
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,676
Because now you can never
go back.

547
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,682
There is a way to break
a fairy deal, isn't there?

548
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,053
It doesn't matter.

549
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,149
"Doesn't matter"?

550
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,524
Of course it does.

551
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,530
I will not do it.

552
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:46,896
Our deals are the foundation of our
culture and key to our survival.

553
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,829
You are their queen.

554
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,542
You came here to save them.

555
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,202
If you don't,
what's the point?

556
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,039
Fairies are known
for honoring their deals.

557
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,018
When we break them,
we lose the people's trust

558
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,581
and our limited leverage,
which we need for survival.

559
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,923
Without that, we are weak
and vulnerable.

560
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:16,056
It would be better for all of us
for me to take it to the grave.

right now?

She's convincing the Stone Queen
that we'll get magic back.

616
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,801
Because we will.

617
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,667
And she's threatening her
with it.

618
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,707
If I'm lying'
invade later and kill me.

619
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,835
But if I'm not,
do you really wanna fight

620
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,971
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

621
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,212

your strategy as well,

00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,289
to threaten me?

00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,482
I'd be well within
my rights,

625
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,824
given that your army
is about to attack us.

626
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:45,325
But, no,
I'm not threatening you.

00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,294
What, exactly?

<i>ST ONE QUEEN: On the
off-chance this is true,</i>

630
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,336
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

631
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,747
Once we give back magic to the people,
we won't have to take anything.

632
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,718
Hell, they'll be begging us
to take back our thrones.

633
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,348
Our Magicians can identify
anyone with magical talent.

634
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,226
And it's likely that many
of your people have it

635
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,559
without the education
to know it.

636
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,369
So we'll educate them.

637
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,874
Soon you could have magic
as powerful as ours.

I've never seen anyone
fight their destiny so hard

while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

644
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,862
I mean,
you narrowly escaped death.

645
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,064

646
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,439
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

647
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,874
Who does that?

648
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,913

who you are.

Shh!

653
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,619
I told you, low profile.

654
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,755
Okay, so what the hell
are you doing talking to me?

655
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,230
Look, is this about
the metro...

656
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,732
No, it's not about that.

657
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,961
It's much more big picture.

658
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,769
Let's talk about your future
as a Librarian.

659
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,307
Or not.

660
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,967
This is about that quest,
isn't it?

661
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,443
Let me tell you something
about that.

662
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,448
It doesn't matter.

663
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,744
Easy for a god to say.

664
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,912
Spoiler alert,
magic always comes back.

665
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,616
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

666
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,592
verging on the brink
of extinction, but it will.

667
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,788
Because ultimately,

668
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:56,958
magic's a carrot gods use
to keep humans in check.

669
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,693
It's a lot to take in,
I know.

670
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,796
My point is,
your life as a human,

671
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,638
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

672
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:12,478
This quest, your friends...
In a thousand years,

673
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,346
hazy at best.

674
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,512
Your life starts now,
after death.

675
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,556
And, yes, I realize
the phrasing is confusing.

676
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,786
Okay, what... What is this?

677
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,157
Is this some kind of fucked-up

678
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,525
punishment for stealing
a metrocard?

679
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,620
Hardly.

680
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,796
There are a lot of places
you could've ended up

681
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,528
that aren't nearly as nice
as the Underworld.

682
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,366
Shackled to a trolley
reshelving books?

683
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,498
We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

684
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,668
with almost an eternity
to explore it.

685
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:44,179
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

686
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,478
So I have to join a book club
to free myself?

687
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,520
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

688
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,680
and be part of something.

689
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:58,023
You've got that whole loner thing,
but it's obviously a front.

690
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,859
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

691
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,830
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

692
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,527
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

693
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,536
that's read my book, what,
you just think you know me?

694
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,937
But it's why you're always sacrificing
yourself for people, right?

695
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,043
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

696
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,569
If you're that desperate to
move on and maybe somehow

697
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,876
fumble your way
back to your old life,

698
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,077
I won't stop you.

699
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,949
But I'm telling you, Penny,

700
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,419
if you stay down here,

701
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,517
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

702
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,923
You've just gotta
choose it first.

703
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,647
And that should be
the last keystone, right?

704
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,081
I don't understand.

705
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,619
Would you stop...

706
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:05,888
You keep acting
like this is your book.

707
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,487
Maybe 'cause I've been on the quest
for more than two minutes...

708
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,931
Guys, snoop-and-poop voices.
Please.

709
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,833
(SOFTLY) You're hiding
something from me.

710
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,598
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

711
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,765
Guys, seriously, I just got
out of a fantasy prison,

712
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,274
and I don’t wanna end up
in a real one.

713
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,970
Are you working
for the Library?

714
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,602
Yes.

715
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,614
Surprisingly honest. That's...

716
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,115
Are you trying to stop us?

717
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,617
No.

718
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,811
They wanna help us.

719
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,148
They want magic back
as badly as you do.

720
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,620
Well, I find that
a little hard to believe,

721
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,851
given what they did to Harriet
and Victoria and Penny.

722
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,587
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about Victoria?

723
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,195
PENNY: You're welcome.

724
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:52,699
Yeah, you boned me,
but you also saved my life.

725
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,647
And I left you alone
when I shouldn't have.

726
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,485
Christ, okay, just go see
your family already...

727
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,658
QUENTIN: No, I...I don’t...
I don't understand.

728
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,163
What's to understand?
They helped me.

729
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,826
They wanna help us.
How is any of that bad?

730
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,005
Sorry, are you smoking
right now?

731
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:27,407
I was stoked to go on this quest
and hang with you guys, but...

732
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,681
My ex is dead, and you two are
setting my ball hairs on end.

733
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,908
I need this.

734
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,717
I'm just glad
I was a genius

735
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:39,084
who stashed high-end party treats all
over while I was substitute high king.

736
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:46,690
If the Library wanted to help,
why hide it from me'?

737
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,025
Why not just tell me?

738
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,588
Because I know you.

739
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,758
And I know how you'd react.
And you did.

740
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,994
Guys.

741
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,164
Guys.

742
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,569
Guys!

743
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,197
I know
where the Sixth Key is.

744
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,167
ALICE: Where?

745
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:07,216
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

746
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,946
Had it not been for you,
they'd all be dead.

747
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,585
I choose to be grateful.

748
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,953
I won’t tell anyone
about what you did tonight.

749
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,056
It's too late.

750
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,122
There are consequences
to broken deals.

751
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,724
Our word
will mean nothing.

752
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,064
I'm sorry.

753
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,968
Of all the humans that
have ever sought me out,

754
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,637
you're the only one who didn't
do it for personal gain.

755
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:42,241
If more were like you, we might
have been able to coexist.

756
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,718
We still can.

757
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,583
We could at least try.

758
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,890
(SIGHS) You and your companions
are on a quest, correct?

759
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,429
For seven keys?

760
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,486
Yes.

761
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,630
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

762
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:06,834
But ifs what created
and sustains the Fairy Realm.

763
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:13,314
Without the key, everything collapses,
which is why we can never give it to you.

764
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,450
PENNY: Howard.

765
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,197
What's your stupid
book club reading?

766
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,032
(CHUCKLES)

767
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,936
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

768
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:56,014
Gill and Stacey. Greatest
love story ever written.

769
00:41:56,114 --> 00:42:01,325
He's handsome and tough and misunderstood,
but... But with a heart of gold.

770
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:05,300
And she is a driven woman just
trying to make it in a man's world.

771
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,131
So good.

772
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,501
I'm... I'm sure it is.

773
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,699
Penny, meet Kathy.

774
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,036
Kathy, Penny.

775
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,201
'Sup?

776
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,504
He 'supped me.

777
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,374
It's just like
I always imagined.

778
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,508
Penny, try one of
Kathy's cupcakes.

779
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,179
I promise
you won't regret it.
