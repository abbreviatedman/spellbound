00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,105
<i>Currently on the lam
from a billion-year contract.</i>

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,766
Sylvia, what'd you do?

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,841
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,821
ALICE: Just let me see
it again. QUENTIN: No.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,246
Not till you tell me what
you were doing in the Library.

8
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,443
I'm stuck in the Fairy
Realm. How can I see you?

00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,783
JOSH: <i>Lets you see
into other worlds, it's rad.</i>

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,290
You're the absolute worst
rulers Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,121
Honey, you don't
have to listen to Tick.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,336
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,694
Turn around, head
home, relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,460

very rare magical creature.

16
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,297
I mean, it looks
different. It feels different.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,671
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,301
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,471
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,310
<i>to snort so they
can do magic tricks.</i>

21
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,373
I wanna help you
get out of here.

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,208
The necklace.

23
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,755
It kills them when
they use magic.

24
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,756
So you're just okay with letting
Kady take the Fifth Key, huh?

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,557
I'm not letting her do anything.

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,973
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,556
Hey, Kady, I...

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,033

Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

31
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,371
Look, she probably
took it because...

32
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,378
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

33
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,707
At least I know what Kady wants.

34
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,374
What does that mean?

35
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,680
She wants to talk to Penny.

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,549
But you, I don't...

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,298
First, you don't wanna
help us with the quest.

38
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:32,384
Then, suddenly, you want magic
so badly that you nearly kill yourself.

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,394
That's not fair.

40
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,521
None of that is fair.

41
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,589
Okay, well, then what is it?

42
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,963
Do you...

43
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,128
Are you with us? Do
you want magic back?

44
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,662
Of course I want magic.

45
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,404
Okay, well, then what changed?

46
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,476
Why now?

47
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,908
As opposed to when, huh?

48
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,415
When you asked me if I
wanted to go on a quest

49
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,917
five minutes after my dad died?

50
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,422
Would you be ready to
go on a fucking adventure?

51
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,979
Alice, I'm just...

52
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,355
You know, and are you the
only one who's allowed to be

53
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,417
ambivalent and depressive and...

54
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,087
And scared and hate themselves?

55
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,599
But I just have to be
sure of everything, huh?

56
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,066
Fuck you, Quentin.

to get through.

Sorry.

61

We can fight about
this after the quest.

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,346
Just let me see the stupid book.

63
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,824
Whoa.

64
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,958
There's something
she's not telling me.

65
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,472
You really think it was a
good idea to give her the book?

66
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,972
I don't know.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,838
She helped us with the last key.

68
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,470
And we're probably gonna
need her for the next one, so...

69

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

70
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,417

71
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,646
is in the Throne
Room at Whitespire.

for granted again.

finish here before I can leave.

that the fairies are...

Just be careful, okay?

89
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,929

90
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,506
Okay, so Skye's telling the
others what happened to her

91
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,042
and that we wanna
help them escape.

92
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,704
But that can't happen until
we get their necklaces off.

did to you in Fillory was fucked up.

Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

110
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,889
So what you're saying is
that you want a fairy necklace

111
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,899

attached to a fairy's neck.

120

Their mushrooms.

you made with these fairies?

00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,797
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

179
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,126
Give it a think.

180
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,800
Fasten it around
the neck to activate it.

181
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,069
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

182
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,508
Should deter them
from even trying.

183
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,511
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

184
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,776
Oh, I'm sure I'll
figure something out.

185
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,583
So, how does it work?

186
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,981
I mean, what's it powered
by? Considering there's...

187
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,784
That would be a family secret.

188
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:48,193
Okay. Uh, but... Once it's
on, how will I know it's secure?

189
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,494
Has a fairy ever
broken out of one?

190
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,791
(CHUCKLES) Dust.

191
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,230
This is Dust.

192
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,331
I've had him since I was 16.

193
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,807
But he's been in the
family much longer.

194
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
How long?

195
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,442
Over 400 years, sir.

196
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,540
He may not look it, but
he's our oldest Fairy.

197
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,053
Tell Irene her
guest has a collar.

198
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,683
Yes, sir.

199
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,187
There's really only one
way to take them off.

200
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,785
I have a machine that does it.

201
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,262
So don't worry, they're secure.

202
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,393
Great.

203
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,537
Thank you so much
for all your help.

204
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,310
Today is not my day.

205
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,057
I get that you're mad,
okay? But just hear me out.

206
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,073
Okay? You turned me in, Sylvia.

207
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,781
Look, when magic went out,

208
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,430
shit got really bad up
there for my family, okay?

209
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:52,154
My... My brothers, my... My
uncles, my dad, they all got whacked.

210
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,318
And went where?

211
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,960
To the Underworld?
Where you are?

212
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,228
All my people are
up there, Sylvia.

213
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,427
I can't travel, I
can't astral project,

214
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,595
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

215
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,606
My family isn't in the
Underworld, Penny.

216
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,240
They moved on.

217
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,505
To where?

218
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,436
(SIGHS)

219
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,243
I mean, I'm not sure.

220
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,250
The Underworld is
just a way station, really.

221
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:22,346
You hang around for a bit, and then
the bureaucracies that be move you on.

222
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,085
But I don't know
what or where that is.

223
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,386
So your family just left you?

224
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,158
Yeah, Dad's always
sucked at waiting,

225
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,826
so he pulled some
strings and cut the line.

226
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,426
But these contracts that
we sign with the Library

227
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,837
are fucking ironclad,
so I can't go anywhere

228
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,932
until I finish my billion years.

229
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,443
When the Library
put a bounty on you,

230
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,243
it brought me a million years
closer to my family, Penny.

231
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,839
And I'm sorry.

232
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,360
I know that that
doesn't fix anything...

233
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,613
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,954
It fixes shit.

235
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,288
I spoke to a few of the others.

236
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,796
They don't believe me.

237
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:10,360
If I hadn't done the magic, if
I hadn't felt what happened,

238
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,073
I don't think I would
believe me either.

239
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,630
Okay, Skye.

240
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,198
You've got to keep trying.

241
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,371
How? What should I say?

242
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,849
Look, I don't know, but I found
a way to take off the collars.

243
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,510
Edwin's got a
machine in the lab.

244
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:29,078
It won't matter. They're scared.

245
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,319
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

246
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,556
But... There is one more thing.

247
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,323
Several of Ms. Irene's
family have arrived.

248
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,430
Many of them
brought their fairies.

249
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,560
To Brakebills?

250
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,061
Why?

251
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,231
I don't know.

252
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,399
IRENE: Skye.

253
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,668
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,868
JULIA: It's okay.

255
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,178
(SIGHS)

256
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,879
If Skye can't convince them
to run, what are we gonna do?

257
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,715
We introduce them
to someone scarier.

258
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,958
JOSH: I'm on a flying boat!

259
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:10,190
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

260
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,030
Where Tick's waiting with a serrated
spoon to just saw off our heads?

261
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Tick isn't at
Whitespire, though.

262
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,298
He's up north, near Loria.

263
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,965
QUENTIN: The Throne Room is
empty, but we need to move fast.

264
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,564
So the book says
that the Sixth Key

265
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,201
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half-moons,

266
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,905
which is a thing that
happens in Fillory.

267
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,541
Like two black and
white cookies split apart

268
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,519
to form one giant white cookie.

269
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,452
A cookie moon.

270
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,588
Mmm-hmm.

271
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,320
Anyway, so it... It's gonna be super
bright, um, and it happens tonight, so...

272
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,592
Wait, why is Tick up near Loria?

273
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,224
JOSH: Fillory's at war. What?

274
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,461
The fuck?

275
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,027
I know, we are literally questing
through a war-torn country.

276
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,368
So epic.

277
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,408
And who exactly
are we at war with?

278
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,376
The Lorians and the Floaters.

279
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,355
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

280
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,577
That cock's high king for three
seconds and it all goes to shit.

281
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,242
I need to send a bunny to Idri.

282
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,252
Yeah, I'll send one
to that Stone bitch.

283
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,083
Wait, what about the Key?

284
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,554
Q, you just told us

285
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,558
Fillory is getting spit-roasted
by invading forces.

286
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,025
Without us.

287
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,622
Okay, can I say something
obvious, yet potentially controversial?

288
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,224
We are no longer the
Kings and Queens of Fillory.

289
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,428
Says who?

290
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,562
Fillory, when they
overthrew you.

291
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,568
Mmm. Well, they were misguided,

292
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,609
and scared, and they
needed scapegoats.

293
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,612
At some point, you either
have to choose to follow through

294
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,515
on something,
or just, well, die.

295
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,985
Look, we chose this.

296
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:45,219
You captain the Key Quest,
Coldwater, and we'll stop war.

297
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,228
Ooh, ooh, could you drop us off
at Whitespire after it gets dark?

298
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,695
They have that balcony.

299
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,460
We could just rappel
down into the Throne Room.

300
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,434
It would be dope.

301
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,462
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,
'cause this boat don't do complete stops.

302
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,012
FAIRY QUEEN: Yes,
once fairies lived on Earth.

303
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,483
But not in hundreds of years.

304
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,147
Not since we fled to Fillory
because human Magicians

305
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,157
nearly hunted
us into extinction.

306
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,419
I had no idea.

307
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,721
Of course not.

308
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,523
Short memory is a
privilege of the oppressor.

309
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,326
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,600
So you'll understand my disbelief then
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

311
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,336
with tales of a lost
tribe that can't exist.

312
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,849
But they're not...
I've heard enough.

313
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,003
Wait.

314
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,178
You're not listening.

315
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,444
I'd rather remove your tongue.

316
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,008
Maybe your teeth.

317
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,610
You choose.

318
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,053
Go ahead.

319
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,354
You have already
taken so much from me.

320
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,053
What's a few teeth?

321
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,626
You've got two sentences.

322
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,361
Choose wisely.

323
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,695
I hate fairies.

324
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:10,369
So why would I come here, to
a place where you stole my toes

325
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,244
and I lost my child,
if it wasn't true?

326
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,376
Then why would
you do this for me?

327
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,544
It's not for you.

328
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,520
It's for them.
They're still fairies.

329
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,078
But they're nothing like you.

330
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,523
They're more like
traumatized children.

331
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,356
And as a mother, despite
what you did to me,

332
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,420
they deserve a chance to live.

333
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,932
So get off your...

334
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,260
Whatever it is fairies have for
rear butts, and do something.

335
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,533
They need their queen.

336
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,921
(SOBBING)

337
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,460
What part of the Library is
"Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

338
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,531
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

339
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,628
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

340
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:16,572
Uh, it's some weird
research division

341
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,838
that the Library made in
partnership with the people

342
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,278
who run the Underworld.

343
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,646
Librarians like us aren't
even allowed to go in there.

344
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,511
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

345
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,579
What the hell do they
do to these people?

00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,716
Oh, it's like primal therapy for
people who are about to move on.

347
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,785
You go and unload your bullshit
and it lightens your conscience.

348
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,490
I'm sure my dad's
was a nightmare.

349
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,328
This is all part of that
"Underworld is a way station" shit?

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,199
Yeah, they, like, jot
down everything of note,

351
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,397
and then at the end you
get a metrocard out of here.

352
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,304
You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

353
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,639
Well, it's more
like this giant, long,

354
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,475
pig-type creature that
you, like, climb into,

355
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,524
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

356
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,312
Why the hell are we still here?

357
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,874
Why haven't we
hijacked that long pig?

358
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,929
Because it only shows up
when someone has a metro card

359
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,512
and is ready to move on.

the daughter, she
finally becomes the knight

366
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,480
that she set out to be, and
right after she's knighted,

367
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,575
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back. Uh...

What're you doing? Guys, guys.

370
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,384
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

371
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:42,360
The book says the moonlight has to
hit three keystones to reveal the key.

372
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,694
There's three doors, three keystones,
and none of them are near a window.

373
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,666
Okay, so we set up some mirrors,

374
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,464
and bounce around some moonlight,
and then we're back on track,

375

what the book says.

FAIRY QUEEN: You want
me to put on a slave collar?

383
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,382
It's the only way we can get you
in direct contact with Irene's fairies.

384
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,721
Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

385
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,887
For all we know, the McAllistairs
can trigger the collars remotely.

386

what's smart about
rendering myself defenseless

391
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,501
and then entrusting my
life to a powerless Magician?

392
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,761
You're god-touched.

393
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,765
That's one way to put it.

394
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,434
But it also means
I can protect you.

395
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,995
It doesn't mean
that I trust you.

396

I get it. For good reason.

397
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,904
Why would you trust
any human on Earth?

398
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,845
But Fen and I are
risking our lives.

399
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,472
So we need you to trust us.

400
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,641
Or don't.

401
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,552
And we can just
do this on our own.

402
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,814

you want from us?

something with that.

There's nothing.

524
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,086
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

525
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:10,153
Wait, the magic that controls
the collars, they're fairy deals?

526
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,301
Edwin said you're
the oldest of the fairies.

527
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,927
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

528
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,096
Yes.

529
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,836
How could you do that
to your own people?

530
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,908
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

531
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,949
out of existence nearly.

532
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,450
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

533
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:36,319
Several of us volunteered to
bind ourselves to the collars

534
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,050
and the McAllistairs.

535
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,491
A deal that would keep
them from following.

536
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,928
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

537
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,466
But as my generation died,

538
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:51,903
and younger generations
were born into this life,

539
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,633
I lost faith in that sacrifice.

540
00:27:54,706 --> 00:28:00,373
Or in the belief that my Queen
had made it to the other side.

541
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,811
She did.

542
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:08,548
My mother, your Queen, led
us to Fillory, where I was born.

543
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,222
And we were able to
create a home there.

544
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,317
All because of your sacrifice.

545
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,063
You never should have come.

546
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:25,666
Because now you
can never go back.

547
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,671
There is a way to break
a fairy deal, isn't there?

548
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,077
It doesn't matter.

549
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,139
"Doesn't matter"?

550
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,514
Of course it does.

551
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,519
I will not do it.

552
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:46,885
Our deals are the foundation of
our culture and key to our survival.

553
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,795
You are their queen.

554
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,531
You came here to save them.

555
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,191
If you don't, what's the point?

556
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,029
Fairies are known for
honoring their deals.

557
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,007
When we break them,
we lose the people's trust

558
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,570
and our limited leverage,
which we need for survival.

559
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:11,913
Without that, we are
weak and vulnerable.

560
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:16,046
It would be better for all of us
for me to take it to the grave.

didn't really say.

those two lazy eyes and...

Never really know which one to
focus on 'cause they're both moving.

596

I... I had, uh...

597
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,722
I couldn't really see
his face under his hood,

598
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:10,422
but he had... He
had glowing red eyes.

where am I going?

602

(CHUCKLES)

610
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,737
Hello, Penny.

611
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,272
Let's chat.

612
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,670
I've missed this.

613
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,777
But it doesn't change anything.

614
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,017
You know what
Margo's doing right now?

615
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,289
She's convincing the Stone
Queen that we'll get magic back.

616
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,790
Because we will.

617
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,690
And she's
threatening her with it.

618
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,719
If I'm lying, invade
later and kill me.

619
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,858
But if I'm not, do
you really wanna fight

620
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,960
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

621
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,201
your entire army
into fucking compost?

622
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,820
IDRI: And is that
your strategy as well,

623
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,244
to threaten me?

624
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,471
I'd be well within my rights,

625
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,813
given that your army
is about to attack us.

626
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:45,314
But, no, I'm not
threatening you.

627
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,188
I am promising you...

628
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,285
What, exactly?

629
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,626
STONE QUEEN: <i>On
the off-chance this is true,</i>

630
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,325
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

631
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,770
Once we give back magic to the
people, we won't have to take anything.

632
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,741
Hell, they'll be begging
us to take back our thrones.

633
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,337
Our Magicians can identify
anyone with magical talent.

634
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,215
And it's likely that many
of your people have it

635
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,550
without the
education to know it.

636
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,358
So we'll educate them.

637
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,863
Soon you could have
magic as powerful as ours.

638

a certain amount of distance

and the residents,

640
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,375
but you are just so
fucking fascinating.

641
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,816
What?

642
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,514
I've never seen anyone
fight their destiny so hard

643
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,717
while simultaneously
propelling themselves towards it.

644
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,851
I mean, you narrowly
escaped death.

645
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,053
Twice.

646
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,429
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

647
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,863
Who does that?

648
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,902
Yeah, I still have
no idea who you are.

649
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,096
Hades.

650
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,664
(CHUCKLES) "Hades."

651
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,072
Like the god?

652
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,268
Shh!

653
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,609
I told you, low profile.

654
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,744
Okay, so what the hell
are you doing talking to me?

655
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,219
Look, is this about the metro...

656
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,721
No, it's not about that.

657
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,950
It's much more big picture.

658
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,759
Let's talk about your
future as a Librarian.

659
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,296
Or not.

660
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,992
This is about
that quest, isn't it?

661
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,432
Let me tell you
something about that.

662
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,437
It doesn't matter.

663
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,733
Easy for a god to say.

664
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,901
Spoiler alert, magic
always comes back.

665
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,605
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

666
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,581
verging on the brink
of extinction, but it will.

667
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,777
Because ultimately,

668
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:56,947
magic's a carrot gods use
to keep humans in check.

669
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,716
It's a lot to take in, I know.

670
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,785
My point is, your
life as a human,

671
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,627
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

672
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:12,467
This quest, your friends...
In a thousand years,

673
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,335
hazy at best.

674
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,501
Your life starts
now, after death.

675
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,579
And, yes, I realize the
phrasing is confusing.

676
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,775
Okay, what... What is this?

677
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,147
Is this some kind of fucked-up

678
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,561
punishment for
stealing a metrocard?

679
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,585
Hardly.

680
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,827
There are a lot of places
you could've ended up

681
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,566
that aren't nearly as
nice as the Underworld.

682
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,389
Shackled to a trolley
reshelving books?

683
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,487
We're in the greatest
Library in the entire universe

684
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,657
with almost an
eternity to explore it.

685
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:44,169
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

686
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,467
So I have to join a
book club to free myself?

687
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,509
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

688
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,669
and be part of something.

689
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:58,012
You've got that whole loner
thing, but it's obviously a front.

690
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,848
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

691
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,820
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

692
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,516
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

693
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,568
that's read my book, what,
you just think you know me?

694
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,926
But it's why you're always
sacrificing yourself for people, right?

695
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,032
To remind them how
important you are to the group?

696
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,558
If you're that desperate to
move on and maybe somehow

697
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,866
fumble your way
back to your old life,

698
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,066
I won't stop you.

699
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,938
But I'm telling you, Penny,

700
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,442
if you stay down here,

701
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,506
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

702
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,912
You've just gotta
choose it first.

703
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,636
And that should be
the last keystone, right?

704
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,070
I don't understand.

705
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,609
Would you stop...

706
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,926
You keep acting
like this is your book.

707
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,510
Maybe 'cause I've been on the
quest for more than two minutes...

708
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,920
Guys, snoop-and-poop
voices. Please.

709
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,856
(SOFTLY) You're hiding
something from me.

710
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,636
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

711
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,754
Guys, seriously, I just
got out of a fantasy prison,

712
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,306
and I don't wanna
end up in a real one.

713
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,959
Are you working for the Library?

714
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,592
Yes.

715
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,603
Surprisingly honest. That's...

716
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,104
Are you trying to stop us?

717
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,606
No.

718
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,800
They wanna help us.

719
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,218
They want magic back
as badly as you do.

720
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,609
Well, I find that a
little hard to believe,

721
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,874
given what they did to
Harriet and Victoria and Penny.

722
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,576
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What about Victoria?

723
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,184
PENNY: You're welcome.

724
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:52,688
Yeah, you boned me,
but you also saved my life.

725
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,636
And I left you alone
when I shouldn't have.

726
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,475
Christ, okay, just go
see your family already...

727
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,647
QUENTIN: No, I... I
don't... I don't understand.

728
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,158
What's to understand?
They helped me.

729
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,815
They wanna help us.
How is any of that bad?

730
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,994
Sorry, are you
smoking right now?

731
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:27,396
I was stoked to go on this quest
and hang with you guys, but...

732
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,670
My ex is dead, and you two
are setting my ball hairs on end.

733
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,897
I need this.

734
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,729
I'm just glad I was a genius

735
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:39,073
who stashed high-end party treats all
over while I was substitute high king.

736
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,679
If the Library wanted to
help, why hide it from me?

737
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,014
Why not just tell me?

738
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,611
Because I know you.

739
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,781
And I know how you'd
react. And you did.

740
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,949
Guys.

741
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,153
Guys.

742
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,592
Guys!

743
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,186
I know where the Sixth Key is.

744
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,122
ALICE: Where?

745
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:07,205
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

746
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,935
Had it not been for
you, they'd all be dead.

747
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,574
I choose to be grateful.

748
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,942
I won't tell anyone about
what you did tonight.

749
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,046
It's too late.

750
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,145
There are consequences
to broken deals.

751
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,713
Our word will mean nothing.

752
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,053
I'm sorry.

753
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,991
Of all the humans that
have ever sought me out,

754
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,626
you're the only one who
didn't do it for personal gain.

755
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,231
If more were like you, we
might have been able to coexist.

756
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,707
We still can.

757
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,572
We could at least try.

758
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,879
(SIGHS) You and your
companions are on a quest, correct?

759
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,418
For seven keys?

760
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,485
Yes.

761
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,620
We have one of the
keys in the Fairy Realm.

762
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:06,859
But it's what created and
sustains the Fairy Realm.

763
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:13,303
Without the key, everything collapses,
which is why we can never give it to you.

764
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,441
PENNY: Howard.

765
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,186
What's your stupid
book club reading?

766
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,021
(CHUCKLES)

767
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,925
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

768
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:56,037
Gill and Stacey. Greatest
love story ever written.

769
00:41:56,114 --> 00:42:01,314
He's handsome and tough and misunderstood,
but... But with a heart of gold.

770
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:05,289
And she is a driven woman just
trying to make it in a man's world.

771
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,120
So good.

772
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,490
I'm... I'm sure it is.

773
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,722
Penny, meet Kathy.

774
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,059
Kathy, Penny.

775
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,190
'Sup?

776
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,493
He 'supped me.

777
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,363
It's just like I
always imagined.

778
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:22,498
Penny, try one of
Kathy's cupcakes.

779
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,168
I promise you won't regret it.
