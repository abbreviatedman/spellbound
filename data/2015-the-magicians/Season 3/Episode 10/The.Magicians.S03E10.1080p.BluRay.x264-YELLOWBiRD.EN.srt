1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,540
Previously on The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,739
I'm a librarian.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,519
Currently on the lam from
a billion year contract.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,140
- Sylvia, what'd you do?
- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,860
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,290
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,630
I'm stuck in the Fairy
Realm. How can I see you?

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,960
Let's you see into other
worlds, it's rad.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,670
You're the absolute worst rulers

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,470
Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,100
Honey, you don't have to listen to Tick.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,700
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,840
Turn around, head home, relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,650
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,180
This magic.

16
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,550
I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,920
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,550
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,720
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,560
to snort so they can do magic tricks.

21
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,630
I wanna help you get out of here.

22
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,460
The necklace.

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,960
It kills them when they use magic.

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,819
So you're just okay with letting Kady

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,230
- take the Fifth Key, huh?
- I'm not letting her do anything.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,690
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,099
Hey, Kady, I...

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,330
Please leave a message at the tone.

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,480
Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,250
Look, she probably took it because...

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,330
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,820
At least I know what Kady wants.

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,490
What does that mean?

34
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,760
She wants to talk to Penny.

35
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,340
But you, I don't...

36
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,360
First, you don't wanna
help us with the Quest.

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,360
Then, suddenly, you want magic so badly

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,090
- that you nearly kill yourself.
- That's not fair.

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,230
None of that is fair.

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,700
Okay, well, then what is it?

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,040
Do you...

42
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,130
Are you with us?
Do you want magic back?

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,610
Of course I want magic.

44
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,510
Okay, well, then what changed?

45
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,180
Why now?

46
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,020
As opposed to when, huh?

47
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,349
When you asked me if I
wanted to go on a Quest

48
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,820
five minutes after my dad died?

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,530
Would you be ready to go
on a fucking adventure?

50
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,970
- Alice, I'm just...
- You know, and are you

51
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,430
the only one who's allowed to be

52
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,530
ambivalent and depressive and...

53
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,380
And scared and hate themselves?

54
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,700
But I just have to be
sure of everything, huh?

55
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,400
Fuck you, Quentin.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,540
Uh, s... sorry.

57
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,580
I was just trying to get through.

58
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,710
Sorry.

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,480
We can fight about this after the Quest.

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,870
Just let me see the stupid book.

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,850
Whoa.

62
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,970
There's something she's not telling me.

63
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,900
You really think it was a good idea

64
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,580
to give her the book?

65
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,080
I don't know.

66
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,940
She helped us with the last key.

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,120
And we're probably gonna need

68
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,110
her for the next one, so...

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,740
The book says that the Sixth Key is

70
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,710
in the Throne Room at Whitespire.

71
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,150
Oh, shit.

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,940
Wait, that's where Margo and Eliot...

73
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,370
Just got overthrown violently? Yeah.

74
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,480
Oh.

75
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,160
I need an aspirin.

76
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,320
Whoa.

77
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,300
Thank you.

78
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,440
I'll never take magic for granted again.

79
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,900
Yeah.

80
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,650
Me neither.

81
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,910
Uh, look,

82
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,060
there's something I have to

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,310
finish here before I can leave.

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,480
I can't go knowing that
the fairies are...

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,780
Jules, do what you gotta do.

86
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,790
- Just be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,180
You too.

88
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,619
Okay, so Skye's telling

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,530
the others what happened to her.

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,090
And that we wanna help them escape.

91
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,850
But that can't happen until

92
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,770
we get their necklaces off.

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,930
Oh.

94
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,530
There's an emoji of a dagger.

95
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,120
Todd was right, this truly
is the universal language.

96
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,140
I need you to focus.

97
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,110
I can't find anything
on these necklaces,

98
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,670
and I need to know how they work.

99
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,780
Can't you see I'm busy?

100
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,280
Fen.

101
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,970
Look, I know what the fairies did

102
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,690
to you in Fillory was fucked up.

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,620
And I'm sorry about that, but...

104
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,020
Yeah...

105
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,330
That's my response.

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,170
Is that a gif of a crab with a knife?

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,630
It's how I feel.

108
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,730
Is it "gif" or "jif?"

109
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,870
Please. I need your help.

110
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,290
Fairies just make my skin crawl.

111
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,870
Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,049
So what you're saying is that

113
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,920
you want a fairy necklace

114
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,920
- to examine?
- Yes.

115
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,650
One that isn't already
attached to a fairy's neck.

116
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,990
Fine, but don't expect me to pretend

117
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,270
like I don't hate fairies.

118
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,680
You don't have to.

119
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,080
We know about your fairies.

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,100
There's one standing right there.

121
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,770
Fen's family had a problem with them,

122
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,540
so I'm trying to help fix it.

123
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,670
I hate them. Their black eyes.

124
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,340
Their long fingers. Their mushrooms.

125
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,710
Mushrooms?

126
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,180
They make the air thick and musty,

127
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,020
like a bear's undercarriage.

128
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,399
And what was the deal that

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
you made with these fairies?

130
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,530
Oh, I didn't make a deal.

131
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,589
- One was made for me by...
- By her family.

132
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,620
See, uh, they were tricked.

133
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,560
Interesting.

134
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,030
And here I thought that the
fairies under my protection

135
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,560
were the last of their kind.

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
I wish.

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,630
- They're everywhere in Fil...
- Fillmore.

138
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,070
Fillmore.

139
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,700
It's, um... it's a small
farming town in the Midwest.

140
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,970
And what about you, Julia?

141
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,370
How is it that you can see them?

142
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,910
I made a deal with a younger fairy.

143
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,890
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

144
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,910
And just how young was this fairy?

145
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,880
I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

146
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,310
Which... which is why
we wanted to ask you,

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,680
how are the ones here,

148
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,400
you know, so docile?

149
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,890
Well, I assume that
you've noticed that, uh,

150
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,900
all of my fairies have
this silver collar.

151
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,070
You mean, their necklace?

152
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,670
Necklaces, yeah.

153
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
They are cute, aren't they?

154
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,340
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

155
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,800
You'll need one.

156
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,650
You can get it from my Uncle Edwin.

157
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,140
But I'm gonna need something in return.

158
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,110
Of course. If your rash is back...

159
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,780
I'll need you to bring me a fairy.

160
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,950
Penny, during orientation,

161
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,450
weren't you trained on how
to properly re-shelve?

162
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,220
We got a billion years, Howard.

163
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,290
Just keeping shit interesting.

164
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,360
So, uh, Penny.

165
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,660
My book club is looking for new members.

166
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,170
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

167
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,410
Why?

168
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,340
'Cause I'm brown?

169
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,300
And shackled?

170
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,140
You know this looks bad
for the Library, right?

171
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Oh, no. We are not...

172
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,880
We shackle people of all
races and colors here.

173
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,710
Not better, Howard.

174
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,480
What I meant was...

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,250
- I read your book.
- The hell?

176
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,580
I had unresolved feelings about my death

177
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,920
and your hand in it.

178
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,220
You killed yourself.

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,190
Am I misremembering the
part where you handed me

180
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,890
the cursed book that
directly led to that?

181
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,830
So the least you can do
is join my book club.

182
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,350
Kathy always brings cupcakes.

183
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,020
- They're amazing.
- Fuck off, Howard.

184
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,840
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

185
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,540
Give it a think.

186
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,850
Fasten it around the
neck to activate it.

187
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,080
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

188
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Should deter them from even trying.

189
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,630
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

190
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,860
Oh, I'm sure I'll figure something out.

191
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,260
So, how does it work?

192
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,780
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's...

193
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,520
That would be a family secret.

194
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,290
Okay. Uh, but...

195
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,140
once it's on, how will
I know it's secure?

196
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,870
Has a fairy ever broken out of one?

197
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,310
Dust.

198
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,210
This is Dust.

199
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,380
I've had him since I was 16.

200
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,820
But he's been in the family much longer.

201
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,260
How long?

202
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,510
Over 400 years, sir.

203
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,249
He may not look it,

204
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,389
but he's our oldest Fairy.

205
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,860
Tell Irene her guest has a collar.

206
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,200
Yes, sir.

207
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,240
There's really only one
way to take them off.

208
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,800
I have a machine that does it.

209
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,270
So don't worry, they're secure.

210
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,080
Great.

211
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,580
Thank you so much for all your help.

212
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,430
- Today is not my day.
- I get that you're mad, okay?

213
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,210
- But just hear me out.
- You turned me in, Sylvia.

214
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,790
Look, when magic went out,

215
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,720
shit got really bad up
there for my family, okay?

216
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,100
My... my brothers, my...
my uncles, my dad,

217
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,430
- they all got whacked.
- And went where?

218
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,540
To the Underworld? Where you are?

219
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,980
All my people are up there, Sylvia.

220
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,370
I can't travel, I can't astral project,

221
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,599
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

222
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,610
My family isn't in the
Underworld, Penny.

223
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,270
They moved on.

224
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,510
To where?

225
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,290
I mean, I'm not sure.

226
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,290
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

227
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,890
You hang around for a bit, and then

228
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,360
the bureaucracies that be move you on.

229
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,420
But I don't know what or where that is.

230
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,400
So your family just left you?

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,170
Yeah, Dad's always sucked at waiting,

232
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,840
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

233
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,470
But these contracts that
we sign with the Library

234
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,370
are fucking ironclad,

235
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,850
so I can't go anywhere

236
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,980
until I finish my billion years.

237
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,480
When the Library put a bounty on you,

238
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,169
it brought me a million years

239
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,040
closer to my family, Penny.

240
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,360
And I'm sorry. I know that
that doesn't fix anything...

241
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,030
Yeah, you're right.

242
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,310
It fixes shit.

243
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,330
I spoke to a few of the others.

244
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,870
They don't believe me.

245
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,240
If I hadn't done the magic,

246
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,340
if I hadn't felt what happened,

247
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
I don't think I would believe me either.

248
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,680
Okay, Skye.

249
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,109
You've got to keep trying.

250
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,250
How? What should I say?

251
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,140
Look, I don't know,

252
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,780
but I found a way to
take off the collars.

253
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,589
Edwin's got a machine in the Lab.

254
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,090
It won't matter. They're scared.

255
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,360
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

256
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,819
But...

257
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,990
There is one more thing.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Several of Ms. Irene's
family have arrived.

259
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,629
Many of them brought their fairies.

260
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,350
To Brakebills?

261
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,040
Why?

262
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
I don't know.

263
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,410
Skye.

264
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,710
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,710
It's okay.

266
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,050
If Skye can't convince them

267
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,730
to run, what are we gonna do?

268
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,260
We introduce them to someone scarier.

269
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm on a flying boat!

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,230
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

271
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,230
Where Tick's waiting
with a serrated spoon

272
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,070
to just saw off our heads?

273
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,780
Tick isn't at Whitespire, though.

274
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,310
He's up north, near Loria.

275
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,980
The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

276
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,610
So the book says that the Sixth Key

277
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,250
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half moons,

278
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,950
which is a thing that
happens in Fillory.

279
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,580
Like two black and white
cookies split apart

280
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,130
to form one giant white cookie.

281
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,490
A cookie moon.

282
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,000
Mm-hmm.

283
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,030
Uh, anyway,

284
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,869
so it... it's gonna be super bright,

285
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,330
um, and it happens tonight, so...

286
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,630
Wait, why is Tick up near Loria?

287
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,270
- Fillory's at war.
- What?

288
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,470
The fuck?

289
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,170
I know, we are literally Questing

290
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,040
through a war-torn country.

291
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,370
So epic.

292
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,640
And who exactly are we at war with?

293
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,380
The Lorians and the Floaters.

294
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,449
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

295
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,479
That cock's High King for three seconds

296
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,280
- and it all goes to shit.
- I need to send a Bunny to Idri.

297
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,290
Yeah, I'll send one to that Stone bitch.

298
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,939
Wait, what about the key?

299
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,560
Q, you just told us,

300
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,560
Fillory is being spit-roasted
by invading forces.

301
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,030
Without us.

302
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,800
Okay, can I say something obvious,

303
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,670
yet potentially controversial?

304
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,240
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

305
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,470
Says who?

306
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,570
Fillory, when they overthrew you.

307
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,540
- Mm...
- Well, they were misguided,

308
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,640
and scared, and they needed scapegoats.

309
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,440
At some point, you either have

310
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,830
to choose to follow through

311
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,680
on something, or just,

312
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,170
well,

313
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,670
die.

314
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,020
Look, we chose this.

315
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,320
You captain the Key Quest, Coldwater,

316
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,220
and we'll stop war.

317
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,190
Ooh, ooh, can you drop
us off at Whitespire

318
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,340
after it gets dark?

319
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,729
They have that balcony.

320
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,500
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

321
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,430
It would be dope.

322
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,500
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,

323
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,800
'cause this boat don't
do complete stops.

324
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,539
Yes, once fairies lived on Earth.

325
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,940
But not in hundreds of years.

326
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,899
Not since we fled to Fillory

327
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,200
because human Magicians

328
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,180
nearly hunted us into extinction.

329
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,750
I had no idea.

330
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,690
Of course not.

331
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,890
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

332
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,690
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,030
So you'll understand my disbelief then

334
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,930
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

335
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,499
with tales of a lost
tribe that can't exist.

336
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
- But they're not...
- I've heard enough.

337
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,550
Wait.

338
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,490
You're not listening.

339
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,720
I'd rather remove your tongue.

340
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,830
Maybe your teeth.

341
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,360
- You choose.
- Go ahead.

342
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,670
You have already taken so much from me.

343
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,370
What's a few teeth?

344
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,910
You've got two sentences.

345
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,870
Choose wisely.

346
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,010
I hate fairies.

347
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,130
So why would I come here,

348
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,690
to a place where you stole my toes

349
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,230
and I lost my child, if it wasn't true?

350
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,690
Then why would you do this for me?

351
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,860
It's not for you.

352
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,660
- It's for them.
- They're still fairies.

353
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,400
But they're nothing like you.

354
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,830
They're more like traumatized children.

355
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,670
And as a mother, despite
what you did to me,

356
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,690
they deserve a chance to live.

357
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,950
So get off your...

358
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,640
Whatever it is fairies
have for rear butts,

359
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,580
and do something.

360
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,830
They need their Queen.

361
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,570
What part of the Library

362
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,750
is "Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

363
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,570
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

364
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,940
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

365
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,500
Uh, it's some weird

366
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,760
research division

367
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,120
that the Library made in
partnership with the people

368
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,240
who run the Underworld.

369
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,360
Librarians like us aren't
even allowed to go in there.

370
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,890
What the hell do they
do to these people?

371
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,460
Oh, it's like primal therapy

372
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,000
for people who are about to move on.

373
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,800
You go and unload your bullshit

374
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,100
and it lightens your conscience.

375
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm sure my dad's was a nightmare.

376
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,970
This is all part of that

377
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,640
"Underworld is a way station" shit?

378
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,470
Yeah, they, like, jot
down everything of note,

379
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
and then at the end you get
a metro card out of here.

380
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,300
You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

381
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,860
Well, it's more like this giant, long,

382
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,780
pig-type creature that
you, like, climb into,

383
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,790
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

384
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,620
Why the hell are we still here?

385
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,180
Why haven't we hijacked that long pig?

386
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,859
Because it only shows
up when somebody has

387
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,830
a metro card and is ready to move on.

388
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,630
Our contracts will never let us move on.

389
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,940
Nobody's ever gonna give
us metro cards, Penny.

390
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,140
Not like them.

391
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,780
Okay, so in this chapter

392
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,780
the Daughter, she finally
becomes the Knight

393
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,780
that she set out to be, and
right after she's knighted,

394
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,890
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back.

395
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,990
- What're you doing?
- Guys, guys.

396
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,690
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

397
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,540
The book says the moonlight has to hit

398
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,330
three keystones to reveal the key.

399
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,070
There's three doors, three keystones,

400
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,000
and none of them are near a window.

401
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,970
Okay, so we set up some mirrors,

402
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,670
and bounce around some moonlight,

403
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,910
and then we're back on track?
Enjoying the Quest?

404
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,360
- Yeah, if that's what the book says.
- Ou know it does.

405
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,339
Hey.

406
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,680
Look, it's a perfect metaphor
for your relationship.

407
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,480
Not ready to laugh...

408
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,750
Yet, that's fine.

409
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,270
You want me to put on a slave collar?

410
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,750
It's the only way we can get you

411
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,349
in direct contact with Irene's fairies.

412
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,960
Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

413
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,360
For all we know, the McAllistairs

414
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
can trigger the collars remotely.

415
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,730
And just like that...

416
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,940
Every collared fairy will be dead.

417
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,570
We need to be stealth. Smart.

418
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,980
Tell me,

419
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,639
what's smart about rendering
myself defenseless

420
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,730
and then entrusting my life

421
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,750
to a powerless Magician?

422
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,130
You're god-touched.

423
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,540
That's one way to put it.

424
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,610
But it also means I can protect you.

425
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,780
It doesn't mean that I trust you.

426
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,810
I get it. For good reason.

427
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,080
Why would you trust any human on Earth?

428
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,990
But Fen and I are risking our lives.

429
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,650
So we need you to trust us.

430
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,220
Or don't.

431
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,690
And we can just do this on our own.

432
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,490
Without you.

433
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,840
She's right.

434
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm not sure how, but
we will find a way.

435
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,930
What is it that you want from us?

436
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,840
Not sure I understand.

437
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,830
She's healing a mother's
wound, but you...

438
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,409
Why go so far, Julia?

439
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,960
Let's just say being
god-touched is a mixed bag.

440
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,820
But I choose to do something with that.

441
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,780
It means something.

442
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,429
Helping those fairies,

443
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,020
saving them, with you.

444
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,660
And this collar.

445
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,540
This had better work.

446
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:07,025
She really is stunning.

447
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,955
How many more of them are there?

448
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:10,425
Hard to say, really.

449
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,175
They're not all that friendly.

450
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,735
And where did you say your
friend is from again?

451
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,925
- The Midwest.
- No, I mean what town is she...

452
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,385
Huh, excuse me.

453
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,945
Fairly well-behaved, actually,

454
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,775
considering she's feral.

455
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,715
Guess I got lucky, huh?

456
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,715
Uh, that's a much faster

457
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:40,255
turnaround than we agreed on.

458
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,475
You know what, it'll be a push,

459
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:45,995
but I think I can get
it to you all by then.

460
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,925
The others will take some convincing...

461
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,435
Looks like we're working through dinner.

462
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,385
You know what to do with her.

463
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,225
... especially if time is against us.

464
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:59,135
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

465
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,935
But we'll talk later?

466
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:02,805
About the other fairies?

467
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,205
Of course.

468
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,725
Shit.

469
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,685
It's true.

470
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:01,355
What Julia said.

471
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:02,685
You're real.

472
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:07,285
You're a queen.

473
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,435
She's a queen.

474
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:11,875
Of the free fairies.

475
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,045
Never bow your head.

476
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:20,695
For anyone.

477
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:32,395
Collar breaker, collar breaker,

478
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:35,395
where are you?

479
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:50,845
- Ready the chair.
- I need to check the equipment.

480
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,345
Yes, sir.

481
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,395
They're saying they want everything.

482
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:13,665
Our entire supply.

483
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:15,465
Look, I know that it sounds risky,

484
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:17,935
but there is a limited
time to this offer.

485
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,045
- If we don't...
- Risky? No.

486
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:22,345
Reckless. Leave us.

487
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,605
Though we've been separated

488
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,215
by time and great distance,

489
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,385
we are the same.

490
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:33,155
We are spun from divine inspiration.

491
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:34,885
Blessed.

492
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:38,825
We are the living embodiment of magic.

493
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:41,495
I may have secured a new source.

494
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:43,325
Of fairies? How?

495
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,295
Ask Edwin. He's seen her.

496
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:49,065
So I've come to restore your strength.

497
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:51,745
To help you understand

498
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:54,855
the glory of who you are.

499
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:58,255
Your suffering is my suffering.

500
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:01,985
Your injustice, mine.

501
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:04,805
- Where is Edwin?
- Edwin?

502
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:06,815
Edwin is working.

503
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:16,365
And when we are finally free,

504
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:20,935
we are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

505
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,005
gouge out their eyes,

506
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:24,505
cut out their tongues,

507
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:28,295
and hang them by their own entrails.

508
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:40,985
You may feel a pinch, but if you relax,

509
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:42,685
it'll be brief.

510
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:59,055
You want us to pull back our
advancements on Fillory?

511
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:00,464
This is ridiculous.

512
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,325
All we're really asking is
that we pause the invasion.

513
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,895
You both know that the only
reason Eliot and I are

514
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,965
in this mess is because of
fairy meddling bullshit.

515
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:11,065
And as soon as we clear this up
with the people of Fillory...

516
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:13,835
Deposed rulers don't get
their thrones back.

517
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,365
They exile themselves.

518
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:17,065
Or die at the hands of the mob.

519
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:19,175
Is this how you talk to all your allies?

520
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:20,905
Allies?

521
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:23,175
My dear, I have yet to see
any proof that your marriage

522
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:24,975
to my son was ever even consummated.

523
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:27,755
I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

524
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,895
Are you sure that wasn't
from the toad bite?

525
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,255
You saw it?

526
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:35,185
Of course I did. I'm his mother.

527
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:38,725
Wow, that's a lot to process.

528
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:41,695
In any case, I have no
faith in either of you

529
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,365
reclaiming your thrones.

530
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:45,565
We will continue our
advancement on Fillory.

531
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:47,565
I'm afraid Loria declines as well.

532
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,535
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

533
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:52,205
It makes no sense to withdraw

534
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,245
when I know we'll succeed.

535
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:56,555
I have to do what's best for my people.

536
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:59,545
And what about our engagement?

537
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:01,865
You're no longer king, Eliot.

538
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,875
So it's no longer valid.

539
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,755
King Idri,

540
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:08,725
are you saying you have
yet to take a husband?

541
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,355
My son's marble has yet to be polished.

542
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,805
You mossy, pimping bitch.

543
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:17,235
Will you excuse us for two seconds?

544
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:19,615
As much as I would love

545
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,265
to roll your smother-in-law

546
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:22,974
off our boat, it won't prevent either

547
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,335
one of them from invading Fillory.

548
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:26,285
We need to split those
two up before your

549
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:29,155
man's arranged to marry my child bride.

550
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:31,605
And our best plan is...

551
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:37,385
We offer them magic.

552
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:44,955
What the...

553
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,025
Fen!

554
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,155
I just watched him help kill a fairy.

555
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,995
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

556
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:55,905
just a machine that removes their heads.

557
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,285
What?

558
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,305
All right, we just need
to figure something out.

559
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,335
There's nothing.

560
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,275
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

561
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:08,175
Wait, the magic that
controls the collars,

562
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,715
they're fairy deals?

563
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:15,295
Edwin said you're the
oldest of the fairies.

564
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:18,115
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

565
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:20,025
Yes.

566
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,505
How could you do that

567
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,135
to your own people?

568
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:28,095
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

569
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,135
out of existence nearly.

570
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:32,635
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

571
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:34,485
Several of us volunteered

572
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:36,505
to bind ourselves to the collars

573
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:38,205
and the McAllistairs.

574
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,315
A deal that would keep
them from following.

575
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:44,505
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

576
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,645
But as my generation died,

577
00:27:47,685 --> 00:27:52,055
and younger generations
were born into this life,

578
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:54,825
I lost faith in that sacrifice.

579
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:57,905
Or in the belief that my Queen

580
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:00,535
had made it to the other side.

581
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:02,145
She did.

582
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,695
My mother, your Queen,

583
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,885
led us to Fillory, where I was born.

584
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:12,185
And we were able to create a home there.

585
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:14,795
All because of your sacrifice.

586
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,515
You never should have come.

587
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:25,815
Because now you can never go back.

588
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:33,855
There is a way to break a
fairy deal, isn't there?

589
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:37,325
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

590
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:38,695
Of course it does.

591
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,905
I will not do it.

592
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:44,435
Our deals are the
foundation of our culture

593
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:47,405
and key to our survival.

594
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:49,815
You are their Queen.

595
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:52,664
You came here to save them.

596
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:55,085
If you don't, what's the point?

597
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:59,215
Fairies are known for
honoring their deals.

598
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:00,805
When we break them,

599
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:03,195
we lose the people's trust

600
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,004
and our limited leverage,

601
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:07,445
which we need for survival.

602
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:12,095
Without that, we are
weak and vulnerable.

603
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:14,365
It would be better for all of us

604
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:15,925
for me to take it to the grave.

605
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,765
Which will be soon enough!

606
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:19,435
Against the wall.

607
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:22,205
Dust, we're on a schedule.

608
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:34,315
Do not go with him.

609
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,255
What did I just say?

610
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:38,225
I won't let you do this.

611
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:43,685
I do not have time for this.

612
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:51,565
Stop! No!

613
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:13,255
What the fuck?

614
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:31,605
Ah!

615
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:37,775
You guarantee that this
is the best decision

616
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,515
- for our family?
- I guarantee it.

617
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,655
Do not make me regret
my decision, Irene.

618
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:44,195
Oh, Vincent, when have I ever

619
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:45,655
steered this family wrong?

620
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:47,725
Cheers.

621
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,455
- To us. To a new future.
- Cheers.

622
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:52,015
Oh.

623
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,365
Ahh!

624
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:43,345
Shit.

625
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:45,285
It seems like those Secrets

626
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,555
dicks really made you earn it.

627
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,435
Any idea where you're going

628
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:51,355
now that you're moving on?

629
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:53,555
No, they, uh... They didn't really say.

630
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:55,495
Well, who'd you talk to?

631
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:57,495
Was it Fran? Oh, she's...

632
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,865
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and...

633
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:01,775
Never really know which one to focus on

634
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,495
'cause they're both moving.

635
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:04,865
I... I had, uh...

636
00:32:04,905 --> 00:32:06,835
I couldn't really see his
face under his hood,

637
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:10,505
but he had... He had glowing red eyes.

638
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,205
- Oh.
- What... what does that mean?

639
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:16,755
Oh, you must have done some

640
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:19,895
horrible shit in your time.

641
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,794
Wait, wait, uh, whe... where am I going?

642
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:24,585
Is it hell?

643
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,715
If only.

644
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:32,885
At least hell is warm.

645
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,225
There's a place worse than hell?

646
00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:38,435
Oh, and way more creative
with what they plug

647
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:40,365
all of your openings up with.

648
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,194
I'm not ready.

649
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,275
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

650
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:52,845
Hello, Penny.

651
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:54,385
Let's chat.

652
00:32:57,085 --> 00:33:00,025
I've missed this.

653
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:02,885
But it doesn't change anything.

654
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:07,395
You know what Margo's doing right now?

655
00:33:07,425 --> 00:33:09,025
She's convincing the Stone Queen

656
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,395
that we'll get magic back.

657
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:12,895
Because we will.

658
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:15,294
And she's threatening her with it.

659
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:18,805
If I'm lying, invade later and kill me.

660
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:21,945
But if I'm not, do you
really wanna fight

661
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:25,434
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

662
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:29,315
your entire army into fucking compost?

663
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:33,344
And is that your strategy as well?

664
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,005
To threaten me?

665
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,735
I'd be well within my rights,

666
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:39,265
given that your army
is about to attack us.

667
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:45,425
But no, I'm not threatening you.

668
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:49,405
- I am promising you...
- What exactly?

669
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:51,885
On the off chance this is true,

670
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:54,585
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

671
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,925
Once we give back magic to the people,

672
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,515
we won't have to take anything.

673
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,564
Hell, they'll be begging us

674
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:03,965
to take back our thrones.

675
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:06,325
Our Magicians can identify

676
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,605
anyone with magical talent.

677
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,475
And it's likely that many
of your people have it

678
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:15,805
without the education to know it.

679
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:20,615
So we'll educate them.

680
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:23,025
Soon you could have magic

681
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:25,125
as powerful as ours.

682
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,555
I usually like to keep
a certain amount of

683
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:41,535
distance between myself
and the residents,

684
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:45,235
but you are just so fucking fascinating.

685
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:47,014
What?

686
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:49,775
I've never seen anyone fight
their destiny so hard

687
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:52,975
while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

688
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,415
I mean, you narrowly escaped death.

689
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:56,785
Twice.

690
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,685
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

691
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:01,115
Who does that?

692
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:04,155
Yeah, I still have no idea who you are.

693
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:05,945
Hades.

694
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:08,895
Hades.

695
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:11,525
- Like the god?
- Shh.

696
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:14,835
I told you, low profile.

697
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,005
Okay, so what the hell are
you doing talking to me?

698
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,215
- Look, is this about the metro...
- No, it's not about that.

699
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:26,705
It's much more big picture.

700
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:30,015
Let's talk about your
future as a Librarian.

701
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,545
Or not.

702
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:34,215
This is about that Quest, isn't it?

703
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:36,685
Let me tell you something about that.

704
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:39,275
It doesn't matter.

705
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:40,985
Easy for a god to say.

706
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:42,464
Spoiler alert...

707
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:45,165
Magic always comes back.

708
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:47,865
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

709
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,835
verging on the brink of
extinction, but it will.

710
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:53,035
Because ultimately,

711
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,044
magic's a carrot gods use

712
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:57,445
to keep humans in check.

713
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,945
It's a lot to take in, I know.

714
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:03,475
My point is, your life as a human,

715
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:06,885
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

716
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,755
This Quest, your friends,

717
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,715
in a thousand years,

718
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,985
hazy at best.

719
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:18,395
Your life starts now,

720
00:36:18,645 --> 00:36:20,485
after death.

721
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:22,795
And yes, I realize the
phrasing is confusing.

722
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,035
Okay, what... what is this?

723
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:26,625
Is this some kind of fucked up

724
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:28,164
punishment for stealing a metro card?

725
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:30,735
Hardly. There are a lot of
places you could've ended up

726
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:33,405
that aren't nearly as
nice as the Underworld.

727
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:35,865
Shackled to a trolley re-shelving books?

728
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,745
We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

729
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:40,915
with almost an eternity to explore it.

730
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:44,415
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

731
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,905
So I have to join a book
club to free myself?

732
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:50,935
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

733
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,105
and be part of something.

734
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,475
You've got that whole loner thing,

735
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:58,445
but it's obviously a front.

736
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:01,285
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

737
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:03,255
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

738
00:37:03,285 --> 00:37:05,755
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

739
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,785
that's read my book... what,
you just think you know me?

740
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:09,964
But it's why you're always sacrificing

741
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,465
yourself for people, right?

742
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:14,465
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

743
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,245
If you're that desperate to

744
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:18,005
move on and maybe somehow

745
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,924
fumble your way back to your old life,

746
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:23,225
I won't stop you.

747
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:26,005
But I'm telling you, Penny,

748
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:28,425
if you stay down here,

749
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:31,885
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

750
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:35,525
You've just gotta choose it first.

751
00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:53,405
And that should be the
last keystone, right?

752
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:59,105
I don't understand.

753
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:04,595
Would you stop...

754
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:06,154
You keep acting like this is your book.

755
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:07,325
Maybe 'cause I've been on the Quest

756
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:08,725
for more than two minutes...

757
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:11,655
Guys, snoop-and-poop voices. Please.

758
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:14,065
You're hiding something from me.

759
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,835
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

760
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,995
Guys, seriously, I just got
out of a fantasy prison,

761
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:19,805
and I don't wanna end up in a real one.

762
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:21,885
Are you working for the Library?

763
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,395
Yes.

764
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:25,365
Surprisingly honest. That's...

765
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,345
Are you trying to stop us?

766
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,845
No.

767
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:31,965
They wanna help us. They want
magic back as badly as you do.

768
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,405
Well, I find that a
little hard to believe,

769
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,955
given what they did to Harriett
and Victoria and Penny.

770
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:38,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about Victoria?

771
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:46,665
You're welcome.

772
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:50,875
Yeah, you boned me, but

773
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,155
you also saved my life.

774
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,305
And I left you

775
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:58,515
alone when I shouldn't have.

776
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,745
Christ, okay, just go see
your family alread...

777
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:13,745
No, I... I don't... I don't understand.

778
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,205
What's to understand? They helped me.

779
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:18,045
They wanna help us. How
is any of that bad?

780
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,085
Sorry, are you smoking right now?

781
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:25,384
I was stoked to go on this

782
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,835
Quest and hang with you guys, but...

783
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:31,765
My ex is dead, and you two are
setting my ball hairs on end.

784
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:33,514
I need this.

785
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:35,305
I'm just glad I was a genius

786
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:37,105
who stashed high-end
party treats all over

787
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:39,635
while I was Substitute High King.

788
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,614
If the Library wanted to help,

789
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,255
why hide it from me?
Why not just tell me?

790
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,825
Because I know you.

791
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,175
And I know how you'd react. And you did.

792
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:53,515
Guys.

793
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:55,195
Guys.

794
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:56,565
Guys!

795
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:58,975
I know where the Sixth Key is.

796
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:01,075
Where?

797
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:07,255
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

798
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:10,415
Had it not been for you,
they'd all be dead.

799
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:13,015
I choose to be grateful.

800
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:17,305
I won't tell anyone about
what you did tonight.

801
00:40:18,145 --> 00:40:20,285
It's too late.

802
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:23,355
There are consequences to broken deals.

803
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,725
Our word will mean nothing.

804
00:40:25,735 --> 00:40:27,695
I'm sorry.

805
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,195
Of all the humans that
have ever sough me out,

806
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:34,775
you're the only one

807
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,875
who didn't do it for personal gain.

808
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,755
If more were like you,

809
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:42,225
we might have been able to coexist.

810
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:43,995
We still can.

811
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:47,955
We could at least try.

812
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:52,115
You and your companions
are on a Quest, correct?

813
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:54,655
For seven keys?

814
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,335
Yes.

815
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,035
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

816
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:04,195
But it's what created

817
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:07,065
and sustains the Fairy Realm.

818
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:10,165
Without the key, everything collapses,

819
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:14,335
which is why we can
never give it to you.

820
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,405
Howard.

821
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:31,415
What's your stupid book club reading?

822
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:53,275
Gill and Stacey...

823
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:56,245
Greatest love story ever written.

824
00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:59,715
He's handsome and tough
and misunderstood,

825
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:01,545
but... but with a heart of gold.

826
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,955
And she is a driven woman

827
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:06,755
just trying to make it in
a man's world. So good.

828
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:09,465
I'm su... I'm sure it is.

829
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,824
Penny, meet Kathy.

830
00:42:11,825 --> 00:42:13,255
Kathy, Penny.

831
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:14,515
Sup?

832
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,395
He supped me.

833
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,595
It's just like I always imagined.

834
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:22,735
Penny, try one of Kathy's cupcakes.

835
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:25,905
I promise you won't regret it.
