- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,363
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,869
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

7
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:23,587
I'm stuck in the Fairy Realm.
How can I see you?

8

Honey, you don't have

12
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:32,544
You can just do your own thing.

Turn around,

14
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:41,754
It's the excretion of a

This magic.

16

I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

17
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:46,870
Oh, God,
they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,531
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,742
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,451

24
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,745

25

26
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,312

- But when I ask you

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,547

you freak out.

28
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:11,890

Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,895
Look, she probably took it because...

32
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:23,636
Because you trust a heroin addict
more than you trust me.

33
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:26,363
At least I know what Kady wants.

34
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,110
What does that mean?

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,220
She wants to talk to Penny.

36
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,081
But you, I don't...

37
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,349
First, you don't wanna
help us with the Quest.

38
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:37,310
Then, suddenly,
you want magic so badly

39
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,951
- that you nearly kill yourself.
- That's not fair.

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,084
None of that is fair.

41
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,439
Okay, well, then what is it?

42

43

Are you with us? Do you want magic back?

44
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:51,541
Of course I want magic.

45

Okay, well, then what changed?

46
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:56,747

on a fucking adventure?

51
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,956
- Alice, I'm just...
- You know, and are you

52
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:11,260
the only one
who's allowed to be

53
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:13,448

181
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:56,975
What I meant was...

182
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,193
- I read your book.
- The hell?

183
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,491
I had unresolved feelings
about my death

184
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:02,930
and your hand in it.

185
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,922
You killed yourself.

186
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,071
Am I misremembering the
part where you handed me

187
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,999
the cursed book that
directly led to that?

188
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:14,479
So the least you can do
is join my book club.

the transition, Penny.

Give it a think.

193
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:30,794
Fasten it around the
neck to activate it.

194
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:33,964
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

195
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:36,445
Should deter them from even trying.

196
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:39,420
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

197

Oh, I'm sure I'll figure something out.

204

Dust.

205

It doesn't matter.

756
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,731
Easy for a God to say.

Spoiler alert...

758
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,519
Magic always comes back.

759

It may take a millennia

verging on the brink of
extinction, but it will.

761
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,441
Because ultimately,

762
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,527
magic's a carrot Gods use

763
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,980
to keep humans in check.

764
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,561
It's a lot to take in, I know.

765
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:12,199
My point is,
your life as a human,

766
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,402
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

767
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:19,128
This Quest, your friends,

768
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,527
in a thousand years,

769
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:23,542
hazy at best.

770

Your life starts now,

after death.

772
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,497
And yes, I realize the
phrasing is confusing.

773
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,699
Okay, what... what is this?

774
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:35,364
Is this some kind of fucked up

775
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:36,752
punishment for stealing a metro card?

776
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,723
Hardly. There are a lot of
places you could've ended up

777
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,999
that aren't nearly as
nice as the Underworld.

778
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,433
Shackled to
a trolley re-shelving books?

779
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,300
We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

780
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:49,511
with almost
an eternity to explore it.

781
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,324
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

782
00:36:53,464 --> 00:36:56,362
So I have to join a book
club to free myself?

783
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:59,550
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

784
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:01,300
and be part of something.

785
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,042
You've got that whole loner thing,

786
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:06,581
but it's obviously a front.

787
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:09,981
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

788
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:11,870
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

789
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:14,403
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

790
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:16,521
that's read my book...
what, you just think you know me?

791
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:18,551
But it's why
you're always sacrificing

792
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,058
yourself for people, right?

793
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:23,050
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

794
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,777
If you're that desperate to

795
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,616
move on and maybe somehow

796
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:29,394
fumble your way back to
your old life,

797
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:31,355
I won't stop you.

if you stay down here,

800

you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

801
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:44,019
You've just gotta choose it first.

802
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:02,747

keystone, right?
