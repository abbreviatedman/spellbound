1
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:07,475
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,444
- I'm a librarian.

3
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,046
Currently on the lam from
a billion year contract.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,149
Sylvia, what'd you do?
- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,684
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

6
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,253
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

7
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,423
- I'm stuck in the Fairy Realm.
How can I see you?

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,692
- Let's you see into
other worlds, it's rad.

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,460
- You're the absolute
worst rulers

10
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,296
Fillory has ever had.

11
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,164
- Honey, you don't
have to listen to Tick.

12
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,299
You can just do your own thing.

13
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:34,602
Turn around, head home,
relax, whatevs.

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,441
- It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

15
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,243
- This magic.

16
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,312
I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

17
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:45,613
- Oh, God,
they cut off her leg.

18
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,316
- You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

19
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,451
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

20
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,320
to snort so they can do
magic tricks.

21
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,388
I wanna help you
get out of here.

22
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:55,589
[necklaces flutters]

23
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,258
The necklace.

24
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,660
It kills them
when they use magic.

25
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,463
[phone line ringing]

26
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,098
- So you're just okay
with letting Kady

27
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,333
take the Fifth Key, huh?

28
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,201
- I'm not letting her
do anything.

29
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,469
- But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

30
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,204
- Hey, Kady, I...

31
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,573
- Please leave a message
at the tone.

32
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,275
[line beeps]

33
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,346
- Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

34
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,214
Look, she probably
took it because...

35
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:23,317
- Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

36
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,486
- At least I know
what Kady wants.

37
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,221
- What does that mean?

38
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,457
- She wants to talk to Penny.

39
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,359
But you, I don't...

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,127
First, you don't wanna help us
with the Quest.

41
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,130
Then, suddenly,
you want magic so badly

42
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,231
that you nearly
kill yourself.

43
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,233
- That's not fair.

44
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,335
None of that is fair.

45
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,404
- Okay, well, then what is it?

46
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,672
Do you...

47
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,409
Are you with us?
Do you want magic back?

48
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,413
- Of course I want magic.

49
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,248
- Okay, well,
then what changed?

50
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,783
Why now?

51
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,651
- As opposed to when, huh?

52
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,254
When you asked me
if I wanted to go on a Quest

53
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,656
five minutes
after my dad died?

54
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,260
Would you be ready
to go on a fucking adventure?

55
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,695
- Alice, I'm just...

56
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,198
- You know, and are you the
only one who's allowed to be

57
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,266
ambivalent and depressive and...

58
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,801
And scared
and hate themselves?

59
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,405
But I just have
to be sure of everything, huh?

60
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:21,409
Fuck you, Quentin.

61
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,278
- Uh, s... sorry.

62
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,314
I was just trying
to get through.

63
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,450
Sorry.

64
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,252
- We can fight about this
after the Quest.

65
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,322
Just let me see
the stupid book.

66
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,205
- Whoa.

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,706
- There's something
she's not telling me.

68
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,310
- You really think it was a
good idea to give her the book?

69
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,711
- I don't know.

70
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,613
She helped us
with the last key.

71
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,317
And we're probably gonna need
her for the next one, so...

72
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:06,287
[solemn music]

73
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,490
The book says that
the Sixth Key is

74
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,459
in the Throne Room
at Whitespire.

75
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,261
- Oh, shit.

76
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,662
Wait, that's where
Margo and Eliot...

77
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,431
- Just got overthrown
violently?

78
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,568
Yeah.

79
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,303
Oh.
[sighs]

80
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,340
I need an aspirin.

81
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:38,252
Whoa.
Thank you.

82
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,620
- [chuckles]

83
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,256
- I'll never take magic
for granted again.

84
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,624
- [chuckles] Yeah.

85
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,760
Me neither.

86
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,629
Uh, look,

87
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,366
there's something I have to
finish here before I can leave.

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,302
I can't go knowing
that the fairies are...

89
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,538
- Jules, do what you gotta do.

90
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,541
Just be careful,
okay?

91
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,776
- You too.

92
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,346
Okay, so Skye's telling the
others what happened to her.

93
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,780
And that we wanna
help them escape.

94
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,517
But that can't happen until
we get their necklaces off.

95
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,651
- Oh.
[laughs]

96
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,354
There's an emoji of a dagger.

97
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,590
Todd was right, this truly is
the universal language.

98
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,825
- I need you to focus.

99
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,793
I can't find anything
on these necklaces,

100
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,462
and I need to know
how they work.

101
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,531
- Can't you see I'm busy?

102
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,932
- Fen.

103
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,335
Look, I know what the fairies
did to you in Fillory

104
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:28,469
was fucked up.

105
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,404
And I'm sorry about that, but...

106
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,739
- Yeah...
[cell phone beeps]

107
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,309
That's my response.
[cell phone dings]

108
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:41,415
- Is that a gif of a crab
with a knife?

109
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,416
- It's how I feel.

110
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,519
Is it "gif" or "jif?"

111
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,622
- Please.
I need your help.

112
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,363
- Fairies just
make my skin crawl.

113
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,966
- Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

114
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,670
- So what you're saying is
that you want a fairy necklace

115
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,672
to examine?
- Yes.

116
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,442
One that isn't already attached
to a fairy's neck.

117
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,711
- Fine, but don't
expect me to pretend

118
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,381
like I don't
hate fairies.

119
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,716
- You don't have to.

120
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,452
We know about your fairies.

121
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,820
There's one
standing right there.

122
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,856
[whimsical music]

123
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,560
Fen's family had
a problem with them,

124
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,362
so I'm trying to help fix it.

125
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,464
- I hate them.
Their black eyes.

126
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,000
Their long fingers.
Their mushrooms.

127
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,502
- Mushrooms?

128
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,869
- They make the air thick
and musty,

129
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,739
like a bear's undercarriage.

130
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,709
- And what was the deal that
you made with these fairies?

131
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,477
- Oh, I didn't make a deal.

132
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,012
One was made for me by...
- By her family.

133
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,448
[clears throat]
See, uh, they were tricked.

134
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,383
- Interesting.

135
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,752
And here I thought that
the fairies under my protection

136
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,387
were the last of their kind.

137
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,722
- [sighs]
I wish.

138
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,457
They're everywhere in Fil...
- Fillmore.

139
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,791
Fillmore.

140
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,495
It's, um... it's a small farming
town in the Midwest.

141
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,730
- And what about you, Julia?

142
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,031
How is it that you
can see them?

143
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,499
- I made a deal
with a younger fairy.

144
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,702
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

145
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,671
- And just how young was
this fairy?

146
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,641
- I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

147
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,044
Which... which is
why we wanted to ask you,

148
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:22,416
how are the ones here,
you know, so docile?

149
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,652
- Well, I assume that you've
noticed that, uh,

150
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,655
all of my fairies have
this silver collar.

151
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,790
- You mean, their necklace?

152
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,492
- [chuckles]
Necklaces, yeah.

153
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,661
They are cute, aren't they?

154
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,465
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

155
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,699
You'll need one.

156
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,569
You can get it
from my Uncle Edwin.

157
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,871
But I'm gonna need
something in return.

158
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,839
- Of course.
If your rash is back...

159
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,710
- I'll need you
to bring me a fairy.

160
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,981
[whimsical music]

161
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,063
- [exhales deeply]

162
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,709
- Penny, during orientation,

163
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,111
weren't you trained on
how to properly re-shelve?

164
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,946
- We got a billion years,
Howard.

165
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,981
Just keeping shit interesting.

166
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,050
- So, uh, Penny.

167
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,489
My book club is looking
for new members.

168
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,892
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

169
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,029
- Why?
'Cause I'm brown?

170
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,998
And shackled?

171
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,867
You know this looks bad
for the Library, right?

172
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,503
- Oh, no.
We are not...

173
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,673
We shackle people of
all races and colors here.

174
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,542
- Not better, Howard.

175
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,143
- What I meant was...

176
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,978
I read your book.
- The hell?

177
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,614
- I had unresolved feelings
about my death

178
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,715
and your hand in it.

179
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,951
- You killed yourself.

180
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,919
- Am I misremembering
the part where you handed me

181
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:10,023
the cursed book
that directly led to that?

182
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,627
So the least you can do is
join my book club.

183
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,629
Kathy always brings cupcakes.
They're amazing.

184
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,599
- Fuck off, Howard.

185
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,635
- Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

186
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,838
Give it a think.

187
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,643
- Fasten it around the neck
to activate it.

188
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,846
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

189
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,716
Should deter them
from even trying.

190
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,652
Of course, you have to actually
catch a fairy first.

191
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,854
- Oh, I'm sure I'll figure
something out.

192
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,990
So, how does it work?

193
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,793
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's...

194
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,628
- That would be
a family secret.

195
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,798
- Okay.
Uh, but...

196
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,901
once it's on,
how will I know it's secure?

197
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,669
Has a fairy ever
broken out of one?

198
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:59,740
- [snickers]
Dust.

199
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,942
This is Dust.

200
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,077
I've had him since
I was 16.

201
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,647
But he's been in
the family much longer.

202
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,682
How long?

203
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,584
- Over 400 years, sir.

204
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:14,688
- He may not look it,
but he's our oldest Fairy.

205
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:18,091
Tell Irene her guest
has a collar.

206
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,730
- Yes, sir.

207
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,965
- There's really only one way
to take them off.

208
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,634
I have a machine that does it.

209
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,002
So don't worry, they're secure.

210
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,841
- Great.
[snaps case shut]

211
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,243
Thank you so much
for all your help.

212
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,613
[ominous music]

213
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,851
- Today is not my day.

214
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,819
- I get that you're mad, okay?
But just hear me out.

215
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,756
- You turned me in, Sylvia.

216
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,624
- Look, when magic went out,

217
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,125
shit got really bad up there
for my family, okay?

218
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,863
My... my brothers,
my... my uncles, my dad,

219
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,732
they all got whacked.
- And went where?

220
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,735
To the Underworld?
Where you are?

221
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,004
All my people are up there,
Sylvia.

222
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,106
I can't travel,
I can't astral project,

223
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,742
I can't do shit
'cause of you.

224
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:12,646
- My family isn't
in the Underworld, Penny.

225
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,015
They moved on.

226
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,185
- To where?

227
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,020
- I mean,
I'm not sure.

228
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,022
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

229
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,725
You hang around for a bit,
and then

230
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,094
the bureaucracies that be
move you on.

231
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,031
But I don't know what
or where that is.

232
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,133
- So your family just left you?

233
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,936
- Yeah, Dad's always
sucked at waiting,

234
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,672
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

235
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,174
But these contracts that we
sign with the Library

236
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,678
are fucking ironclad,
so I can't go anywhere

237
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,780
until I finish
my billion years.

238
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,182
When the Library
put a bounty on you,

239
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:53,020
it brought me a million years
closer to my family, Penny.

240
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,688
And I'm sorry.

241
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,089
I know that
that doesn't fix anything...

242
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,191
- Yeah, you're right.

243
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,794
It fixes shit.

244
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,067
- I spoke to a few
of the others.

245
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,703
They don't believe me.

246
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,005
If I hadn't done the magic,

247
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,843
if I hadn't felt what happened,

248
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,878
I don't think I would
believe me either.

249
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,346
- Okay, Skye.

250
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,981
You've got to keep trying.

251
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,117
- How?
What should I say?

252
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,986
- Look, I don't know,

253
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,722
but I found a way
to take off the collars.

254
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,257
Edwin's got a machine
in the Lab.

255
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,894
- It won't matter.
They're scared.

256
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,097
The thought of escape is
like a death wish.

257
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,832
But...

258
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,001
there is one more thing.

259
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,838
Several of Ms. Irene's family
have arrived.

260
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,173
Many of them brought
their fairies.

261
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,842
- To Brakebills?

262
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,843
Why?

263
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,011
- I don't know.

264
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,145
- Skye.

265
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,380
- I'm sorry.

266
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,049
- It's okay.

267
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,852
- [exhales deeply]

268
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,755
- If Skye can't convince them
to run, what are we gonna do?

269
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,025
- We introduce them
to someone scarier.

270
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,828
[whimsical music]

271
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,798
- I'm on a flying boat!

272
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:15,002
- Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

273
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,004
Where Tick's waiting
with a serrated spoon

274
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,872
to just saw off our heads?

275
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,240
- Tick isn't at Whitespire,
though.

276
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,075
He's up north, near Loria.

277
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,812
- The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

278
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,313
So the book says
that the Sixth Key

279
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,016
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half moons,

280
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,784
which is a thing
that happens in Fillory.

281
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:34,287
- Like two black and white
cookies split apart

282
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:38,258
to form one giant white cookie.

283
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,227
A cookie moon.

284
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,295
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,864
Uh, anyway,

286
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,900
so it... it's gonna be
super bright,

287
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,101
um, and it happens tonight,
so...

288
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,337
- Wait, why is Tick up near
Loria?

289
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,039
- Fillory's at war.
- What?

290
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,206
- The fuck?

291
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,975
- I know, we are
literally Questing

292
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,877
through a war-torn country.

293
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,145
So epic.

294
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,180
- And who exactly
are we at war with?

295
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,149
- The Lorians and the Floaters.

296
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,084
- Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

297
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,186
- That cock's High King
for three seconds

298
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,320
and it all goes
to shit.

299
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,056
- I need to send
a Bunny to Idri.

300
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,058
- Yeah, I'll send one
to that Stone bitch.

301
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,926
- Wait, what about the key?

302
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,294
- Q, you just told us,

303
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,297
Fillory is being spit-roasted
by invading forces.

304
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,866
Without us.

305
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,467
- Okay, can I say
something obvious,

306
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,370
yet potentially controversial?

307
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,039
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

308
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,207
- Says who?

309
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,309
- Fillory,
when they overthrew you.

310
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,279
- Mm...
- Well, they were misguided,

311
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,347
and scared,
and they needed scapegoats.

312
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,350
At some point, you either have
to choose to follow through

313
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,386
on something, or just,

314
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,221
well,

315
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,255
die.

316
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,859
- Look, we chose this.

317
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,095
You captain the Key Quest,
Coldwater,

318
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,030
and we'll stop war.

319
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,000
- Ooh, ooh, can you drop us off
at Whitespire

320
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,034
after it gets dark?

321
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,402
They have that balcony.

322
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,238
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

323
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,207
It would be dope.

324
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,242
- Get ready to tuck and roll,
bitches,

325
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,283
.

326
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,084
- Yes, once fairies
lived on Earth.

327
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,088
But not in hundreds of years.

328
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,625
Not since we fled to Fillory
because human Magicians

329
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,628
nearly hunted us
into extinction.

330
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,030
- I had no idea.

331
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,965
- Of course not.

332
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,135
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

333
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,569
[ominous music]

334
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,971
- I'm sorry.

335
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,240
- So you'll understand
my disbelief then

336
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,176
when a human tries
to lure me to Earth

337
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,980
with tales of a lost tribe
that can't exist.

338
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,381
- But they're not...
- I've heard enough.

339
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,951
- Wait.

340
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,652
You're not listening.

341
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,055
- I'd rather remove
your tongue.

342
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,123
Maybe your teeth.

343
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,124
You choose.

344
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,559
- Go ahead.

345
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,996
You have already taken
so much from me.

346
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,564
What's a few teeth?

347
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,203
- You've got two sentences.

348
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,173
Choose wisely.

349
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,276
- I hate fairies.

350
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:14,014
So why would I come here, to
a place where you stole my toes

351
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,651
and I lost my child,
if it wasn't true?

352
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,021
- Then why would you
do this for me?

353
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,156
- It's not for you.

354
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,125
It's for them.
- They're still fairies.

355
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,593
- But they're nothing like you.

356
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,129
They're more like
traumatized children.

357
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,999
And as a mother,
despite what you did to me,

358
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,701
they deserve a chance to live.

359
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,703
So get off your...

360
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,107
whatever it is fairies
have for rear butts,

361
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,741
and do something.

362
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,212
They need their Queen.

363
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,251
[chain rattling]

364
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,154
[ominous music]

365
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,290
- [sighs]

366
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,263
- [sobbing]

367
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,734
- What part of the Library

368
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,703
is "Secrets Taken
to the Grave"?

369
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,140
- Oh, so now you're
talking to me?

370
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,242
I'm... I'm kidding.
Chill.

371
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:20,180
Uh, it's some weird
research division

372
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,382
that the Library made
in partnership with the people

373
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,751
who run the Underworld.

374
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,754
Librarians like us aren't even
allowed to go in there.

375
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,124
- [sobbing]

376
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,193
- What the hell do they do
to these people?

377
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,761
- Oh, it's like primal therapy

378
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,296
for people who are
about to move on.

379
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,131
You go and unload your bullshit

380
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,366
and it lightens your
conscience.

381
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,134
I'm sure my dad's
was a nightmare.

382
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,269
- This is all part of that

383
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,803
"Underworld is
a way station" shit?

384
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,672
- Yeah, they, like, jot down
everything of note,

385
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,041
and then at the end you get
a metro card out of here.

386
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,777
- You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

387
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,247
- Well, it's more like
this giant, long,

388
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,117
pig-type creature that you,
like, climb into,

389
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,119
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

390
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,787
- Why the hell
are we still here?

391
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,021
Why haven't we hijacked
that long pig?

392
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,424
- Because it only shows up when
somebody has a metro card

393
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,159
and is ready to move on.

394
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,760
[woman continues sobbing]

395
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,797
- Our contracts will
never let us move on.

396
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,802
- Nobody's ever gonna give us
metro cards, Penny.

397
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,405
Not like them.

398
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,112
- Okay, so in this chapter

399
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,115
the Daughter,
she finally becomes the Knight

400
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,118
that she set out to be,
and right after she's knighted,

401
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:35,222
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back.

402
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,456
[glass shatters]

403
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,291
- What're you doing?
- Guys, guys.

404
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,861
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

405
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,331
- The book says the moonlight
has to hit three keystones

406
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,832
to reveal the key.

407
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,367
There's three doors,
three keystones,

408
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,302
and none of them
are near a window.

409
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,271
- Okay, so we set up
some mirrors,

410
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,839
and bounce around
some moonlight,

411
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,806
and then we're back
on track?

412
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,242
Enjoying the Quest?

413
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,476
- Yeah, if that's
what the book says.

414
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,844
- You know it does.

415
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,846
- Hey.

416
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,848
Look, it's a perfect metaphor
for your relationship.

417
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,251
[chuckles]

418
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,353
Not ready to laugh...

419
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,121
yet, that's fine.

420
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,857
- You want me to put on
a slave collar?

421
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,891
- It's the only way we can get
you in direct contact

422
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,860
with Irene's fairies.

423
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,329
- Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

424
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,597
- For all we know,
the McAllistairs

425
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,466
can trigger
the collars remotely.

426
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,134
And just like that...
[snaps fingers]...

427
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,303
Every collared fairy
will be dead.

428
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,772
We need to be stealth.
Smart.

429
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,340
- Tell me,

430
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,877
what's smart about rendering
myself defenseless

431
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,182
and then entrusting my life
to a powerless Magician?

432
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,185
[foreboding music]

433
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,637
You're god-touched.

434
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,207
- That's one way to put it.

435
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,908
But it also means
I can protect you.

436
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,244
- It doesn't mean
that I trust you.

437
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,279
- I get it.
For good reason.

438
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,481
Why would you trust
any human on Earth?

439
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,418
But Fen and I
are risking our lives.

440
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,952
So we need you to trust us.

441
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,222
- Or don't.

442
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,190
And we can just do this
on our own.

443
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,825
Without you.

444
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,860
- She's right.

445
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,563
I'm not sure how,
but we will find a way.

446
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,366
- What is it that you want
from us?

447
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,301
- Not sure I understand.

448
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,538
- She's healing
a mother's wound, but you...

449
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,873
Why go so far, Julia?

450
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,546
- Let's just say being
god-touched is a mixed bag.

451
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,282
But I choose
to do something with that.

452
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,251
It means something.

453
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,552
Helping those fairies,

454
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,455
saving them, with you.

455
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,329
And this collar.

456
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,932
- [sighs]

457
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:06,773
.

458
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:07,340
- She really is stunning.

459
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,843
How many more of them
are there?

460
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,412
- Hard to say, really.

461
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,614
They're not all that friendly.

462
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,949
- And where did you say
your friend is from again?

463
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,652
- The Midwest.
- No, I mean what town is she...

464
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:24,324
[cell phone rings]

465
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:28,295
Huh, excuse me.

466
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,833
- Fairly well-behaved,
actually,

467
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,702
considering she's feral.

468
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,637
- Guess I got lucky, huh?

469
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,275
- Uh, that's a much faster
turnaround than we agreed on.

470
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,810
[snaps fingers]

471
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,312
You know what,
it'll be a push,

472
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,880
but I think I can get it
to you all by then.

473
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,816
The others will take some
convincing...

474
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,318
- Looks like we're working
through dinner.

475
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,886
You know what to do with her.

476
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,857
- ...especially if
time is against us.

477
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,993
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

478
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,829
But we'll talk later?

479
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,731
About the other fairies?

480
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,032
- Of course.

481
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,738
[cell phone vibrating]

482
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,474
- [whispering]
Shit.

483
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,854
- It's true.

484
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,857
What Julia said.
You're real.

485
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,696
You're a queen.

486
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,764
She's a queen.

487
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,133
Of the free fairies.

488
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,403
[breathing heavily]

489
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,940
- Never bow your head.

490
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:25,412
For anyone.

491
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,421
- Collar breaker,
collar breaker,

492
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,424
where are you?

493
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,430
[footsteps rustling]

494
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,436
[light bulbs buzzing]

495
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,772
- Ready the chair.
I need to check the equipment.

496
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,174
- Yes, sir.

497
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,987
- [speaking Hebrew]

498
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,859
[magic chimes]

499
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,427
- They're saying they want
everything.

500
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,862
Our entire supply.

501
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,497
- Look, I know that it
sounds risky,

502
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,866
but there is a limited time
to this offer.

503
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,934
If we don't...
- Risky? No.

504
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:25,171
Reckless.
Leave us.

505
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:29,075
- Though we've been separated
by time and great distance,

506
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,210
we are the same.

507
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,047
We are spun
from divine inspiration.

508
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,816
Blessed.

509
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,787
We are the living
embodiment of magic.

510
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,523
- I may have secured
a new source.

511
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,191
- Of fairies?
How?

512
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,159
- Ask Edwin.
He's seen her.

513
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:51,531
- So I've come to restore
your strength.

514
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:57,003
To help you understand
the glory of who you are.

515
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,507
Your suffering is my suffering.

516
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,877
Your injustice, mine.

517
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,979
- Where is Edwin?
- Edwin?

518
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:10,550
Edwin is working.

519
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,224
- And when we
are finally free,

520
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:22,862
we are gonna hunt down every
last living slaver,

521
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,931
gouge out their eyes,

522
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,533
cut out their tongues,

523
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:31,170
and hang them
by their own entrails.

524
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,915
- You may feel a pinch,
but if you relax,

525
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:47,219
it'll be brief.

526
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:56,763
.

527
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:57,830
- You want us to pull back
our advancements on Fillory?

528
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,100
- This is ridiculous.

529
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,603
- All we're really asking is
that we pause the invasion.

530
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:06,072
- You both know that
the only reason Eliot and I

531
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,108
are in this mess is because
of fairy meddling bullshit.

532
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,277
- And as soon as we clear this
up with the people of Fillory...

533
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,146
- Deposed rulers don't get
their thrones back.

534
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,648
They exile themselves.

535
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,216
Or die at the hands
of the mob.

536
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,285
- Is this how you talk
to all your allies?

537
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,087
- Allies?

538
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,289
My dear, I have yet to see any
proof that your marriage

539
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,124
to my son was ever
even consummated.

540
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,094
- I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

541
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,131
- Are you sure that wasn't
from the toad bite?

542
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,566
- You saw it?

543
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,301
- Of course I did.
I'm his mother.

544
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:39,305
- Wow, that's a lot to process.

545
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,908
- In any case, I have no faith
in either of you

546
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,643
reclaiming your thrones.

547
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,812
We will continue
our advancement on Fillory.

548
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,814
- I'm afraid Loria declines
as well.

549
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,783
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

550
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:54,353
It makes no sense to withdraw
when I know we'll succeed.

551
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,290
I have to do what's best
for my people.

552
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,792
- And what about
our engagement?

553
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,294
- You're no longer king, Eliot.

554
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,330
So it's no longer valid.

555
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:09,736
- King Idri, are you saying you
have yet to take a husband?

556
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,639
My son's marble has
yet to be polished.

557
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,841
- You mossy, pimping bitch.

558
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:18,110
- Will you excuse us
for two seconds?

559
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:21,380
As much as I would love to roll
your smother-in-law

560
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,949
off our boat, it won't prevent
either one of them

561
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,851
from invading Fillory.

562
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,953
- We need to split those two up
before your man's arranged

563
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,722
to marry my child bride.

564
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,858
- And our best plan is...

565
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,664
- We offer them magic.

566
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,700
[ominous music]

567
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,137
- What the...

568
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,206
[door clanks open]

569
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,174
- [breathing heavily]

570
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,676
- Fen!

571
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,310
- I just watched him
help kill a fairy.

572
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,180
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

573
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,248
just a machine that
removes their heads.

574
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,284
- What?

575
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,419
- All right, we just need to
figure something out.

576
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,655
- There's nothing.

577
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,390
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

578
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,861
- Wait, the magic that
controls the collars,

579
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:12,732
they're fairy deals?

580
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,768
Edwin said you're
the oldest of the fairies.

581
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,270
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

582
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,206
- Yes.
- [gasps]

583
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:25,411
How could you do that
to your own people?

584
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,247
- Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

585
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,282
out of existence nearly.

586
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,885
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

587
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,789
Several of us volunteered to
bind ourselves to the collars

588
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,357
and the McAllistairs.

589
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,928
A deal that would keep them
from following.

590
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,264
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

591
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,900
But as my generation died,

592
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:52,238
and younger generations
were born into this life,

593
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,041
I lost faith
in that sacrifice.

594
00:27:55,074 --> 00:28:00,813
Or in the belief that my Queen
had made it to the other side.

595
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,783
- She did.

596
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,952
My mother, your Queen,

597
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,756
led us to Fillory,
where I was born.

598
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,491
And we were able
to create a home there.

599
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,329
All because of your sacrifice.

600
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:23,235
- You never should have come.

601
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,038
Because now you can
never go back.

602
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,080
- There is a way to break
a fairy deal, isn't there?

603
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:37,449
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

604
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,951
Of course it does.

605
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,353
- I will not do it.

606
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,991
Our deals are the foundation
of our culture

607
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,526
and key to our survival.

608
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,963
- You are their Queen.

609
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:55,267
You came here to save them.
If you don't, what's the point?

610
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:59,371
- Fairies are known
for honoring their deals.

611
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:03,342
When we break them,
we lose the people's trust

612
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:08,014
and our limited leverage,
which we need for survival.

613
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:12,284
Without that,
we are weak and vulnerable.

614
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:14,486
It would be better
for all of us

615
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,388
for me to take it
to the grave.

616
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,024
- Which will be soon enough!

617
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,558
Against the wall.

618
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,361
Dust, we're on a schedule.

619
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:25,397
[solemn music]

620
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,473
- Do not go with him.

621
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,408
- What did I just say?

622
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,377
- I won't let you do this.

623
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,546
[magic thunders]

624
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,316
- I do not have time for this.

625
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,921
- [whimpering]
[screams]

626
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,858
Stop!
No!

627
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:54,026
[tense music]

628
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,427
[screaming]

629
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,563
[gash gurgles]

630
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,071
[spell sizzles]

631
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,412
- What the fuck?

632
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,481
[groaning]

633
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,185
[heavy thuds]

634
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,898
Ah!

635
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,037
- You guarantee that this is
the best decision

636
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,638
for our family?
- I guarantee it.

637
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,942
- Do not make me
regret my decision, Irene.

638
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,945
- Oh, Vincent, when have I ever
steered this family wrong?

639
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,014
[laughter]
- Cheers.

640
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,581
- To us. To a new future.
- Cheers.

641
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,618
- Oh.
[chuckles]

642
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,121
[screaming,
frightened chatter]

643
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,526
Ahh!

644
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,030
[screaming]

645
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,500
[screams]

646
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,536
[whimpering]

647
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:15,574
[grunts]

648
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,019
.

649
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:27,519
- [breathing heavily]

650
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,990
[ominous music]

651
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:34,226
[sobbing]

652
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,167
[gasps]

653
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,102
- Shit.

654
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:47,273
It seems like those Secrets
dicks really made you earn it.

655
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:51,110
Any idea where you're going now
that you're moving on?

656
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,279
- No, they, uh...
They didn't really say.

657
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,214
- Well, who'd you talk to?

658
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,216
Was it Fran?
Oh, she's...

659
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,518
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and...

660
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,353
Never really know
which one to focus on

661
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,222
'cause they're both moving.
[laughs]

662
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,523
- I... I had, uh...

663
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,492
I couldn't really see
his face under his hood,

664
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:11,097
but he had...
He had glowing red eyes.

665
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,000
- Oh.
- What... what does that mean?

666
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:20,072
- Oh, you must have done some
horrible shit in your time.

667
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,241
- Wait, wait, uh,
whe... where am I going?

668
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,310
Is it hell?

669
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,381
- If only.

670
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:33,252
At least hell is warm.

671
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,021
- There's a place
worse than hell?

672
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,190
- Oh, and way more creative
with what they plug

673
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,126
all of your
openings up with.

674
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,527
- [stammers]
I'm not ready.

675
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,430
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

676
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:48,300
- [chuckles]

677
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,536
[magic whooshes]

678
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,504
- Hello, Penny.

679
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,140
Let's chat.

680
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,675
[tense piano music]

681
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,279
- I've missed this.

682
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,548
But it doesn't change anything.

683
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,153
- You know what Margo's
doing right now?

684
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,487
She's convincing
the Stone Queen

685
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,157
that we'll get
magic back.

686
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,558
Because we will.

687
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,460
And she's threatening her
with it.

688
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,497
- If I'm lying,
invade later and kill me.

689
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,600
But if I'm not,
do you really wanna fight

690
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,703
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

691
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,108
your entire army
into fucking compost?

692
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,544
- And is that your
strategy as well?

693
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,181
To threaten me?

694
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,115
- I'd be well within my rights,

695
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:40,552
given that your army is
about to attack us.

696
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:45,191
But no,
I'm not threatening you.

697
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:49,161
I am promising you...
- What exactly?

698
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,430
- On the off chance
this is true,

699
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,200
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

700
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,468
- Once we give back
magic to the people,

701
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,538
we won't have to take anything.

702
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:03,509
Hell, they'll be begging us
to take back our thrones.

703
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:08,214
- Our Magicians can identify
anyone with magical talent.

704
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,119
And it's likely that many of
your people have it

705
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,387
without the education
to know it.

706
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,226
So we'll educate them.

707
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:24,630
Soon you could have magic
as powerful as ours.

708
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,246
- I usually like to keep
a certain amount of distance

709
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,380
between myself
and the residents,

710
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,251
but you are just
so fucking fascinating.

711
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,385
- What?

712
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,355
- I've never seen anyone fight
their destiny so hard

713
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:52,524
while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

714
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,626
I mean, you narrowly
escaped death.

715
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,362
Twice.

716
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,298
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

717

Who does that?

718
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,669
- Yeah, I still have
no idea who you are.

719
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,272
- Hades.

720

Hades.

721
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:11,177
Like the god?
- Shh.

722
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,413
I told you, low profile.

723
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,552
- Okay, so what the hell are
you doing talking to me?

724
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,522
Look, is this about the metro...
- No, it's not about that.

725
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,625
It's much more big picture.

726
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,561
Let's talk about your future
as a Librarian.

727
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,197
- Or not.

728
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,732
- This is about that Quest,
isn't it?

729
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,302
Let me tell you something
about that.

730
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:39,305
It doesn't matter.

731
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,539
- Easy for a god to say.

732
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:44,676
- Spoiler alert...
Magic always comes back.

733
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,446
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

734
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,416
verging on the brink
of extinction, but it will.

735
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,584
Because ultimately,

736
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:57,389
magic's a carrot gods use
to keep humans in check.

737
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:59,525
It's a lot to take in,
I know.

738
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:03,595
My point is,
your life as a human,

739
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:06,465
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

740
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,369
This Quest, your friends,

741
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,338
in a thousand years,

742
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:15,274
hazy at best.

743
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,509
Your life starts now,

744
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:20,346
after death.

745
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,414
And yes, I realize
the phrasing is confusing.

746
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:24,583
- Okay, what... what is this?

747
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,352
Is this some kind of
fucked up punishment

748
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,386
for stealing
a metro card?

749
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,355
- Hardly.

750
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,589
There are a lot of places
you could've ended up

751
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,391
that aren't nearly
as nice as the Underworld.

752
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,261
- Shackled to a trolley
re-shelving books?

753
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,364
- We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

754
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:40,499
with almost an eternity
to explore it.

755
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,902
And if you want the shackles
off, go to Howard.

756
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:47,339
- So I have to join a book club
to free myself?

757
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:50,376
- All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

758
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,511
and be part of something.

759
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,813
You've got that
whole loner thing,

760
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,783
but it's obviously a front.

761
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,652
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

762
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,621
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

763
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,391
- Yeah, okay, you and everyone
else down here

764
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,393
that's read my book... what,
you just think you know me?

765
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,495
- But it's why you're always
sacrificing yourself

766
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,397
for people, right?

767
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,799
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

768
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:17,436
If you're that desperate to
move on and maybe somehow

769
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,572

to your old life,

770
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,841
I won't stop you.

771
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,444
But I'm telling you, Penny,

772
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,314
if you stay down here,

773
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:32,551
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

774
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:47,933
.

775
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,803
- And that should be
the last keystone, right?

776
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,343
- I don't understand.

777
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,814
- Would you stop...

778
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,015
- You keep acting like
this is your book.

779
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,384
- Maybe 'cause I've been
on the Quest

780

for more than
two minutes...

781

Please.

from me.

- Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

784
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,927
- Guys, seriously, I just got
out of a fantasy prison,

785
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,529
and I don't wanna end up
in a real one.

They want magic back
as badly as you do.

hard to believe,

and Victoria and Penny.

Yeah, you boned me,
but you also saved my life.

Substitute High King.

wanted to help,

why hide it from me?
Why not just tell me?

814

And you did.
