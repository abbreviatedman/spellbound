1
00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:02,007
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,278
We found a key, too.

3
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:05,066
The ghost said it has the power

4
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:08,012
to reveal things that are hidden.
I'm a hidden thing.

5
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:09,074
I'm Hyman.

6
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:12,686
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

7
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:15,103
I spent months trying to push things.

8
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:19,025
I never got anywhere.
Until I tried being the thing.

9
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:20,992
Holy zerts! You did it!

10
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:24,696
The farmers are hesitant because
you're asking them to throw out food

11
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:27,599
- and replace it with, uh...
- Inedible mushrooms.

12
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,435
I got it. I just need it done.

13
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,338
On Earth we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first.

14
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:37,276
<i>Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.</i>

15
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:40,813
It is my duty and honor

16
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,881
to take the place of my late brother.

17
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,284
<i>- Why do you have magic?
- I don't know.</i>

18
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:46,785
I'd do anything to get it back.

19
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,121
If I could give it to you, I would.

20
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,097
What if you could?

21
00:00:58,177 --> 00:01:00,666
Whoo. Sorry.

22
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:02,242
Okay.

23
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,307
Last I checked,
we're looking for a spell,

24
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,533
not starting an eBay store.

25
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:12,810
There's this old hedge story
I once heard

26
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,955
about some sort of electrical transfer.

27
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:18,306
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

28
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:20,548
People still talk about it.

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,439
Just look.

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,767
So, you want us to reverse engineer

31
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:30,062
a hedge witch urban legend
using kids' toys?

32
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,565
I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

33
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,534
so unless you have a better idea.

34
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,691
Do you feel anything?

35
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,800
No.

36
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,236
Go again?

37
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:08,735
♪ Oh, as long as I know ♪

38
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,403
♪ How to love, I know I'll stay alive ♪

39
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,538
Why did that just turn on by itself?

40
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:13,873
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,241
♪ I've got all my love to give ♪

42
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:16,976
♪ And I'll survive ♪

43
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:19,545
Give me your hand.

44
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,414
Wait. Stop.

45
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,082
Do not do this.

46
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,762
Did you just use
that fish as a doorbell?

47
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,556
I've been trying to warn you
guys for, like, an hour.

48
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,087
"Being the fish button"
is the first thing

49
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:29,722
in this entire room that's worked.

50
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,091
- What are you trying to warn us about?
- This spell.

51
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,493
I've seen it in person.

52
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,094
Are you serious?

53
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah.

54
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,165
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

55
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:41,434
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

56
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:44,203
do the transfer, and by the end of it,

57
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,180
everyone was on fire.

58
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,008
Trust me. Fogg was right.

59
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,986
It's a bad idea.

60
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,281
Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

61
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,250
- Aw, f...
- Fuck me.

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,918
You have magic.

63
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,353
And you're just now telling me?

64
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,822
Don't take this the wrong way,

65
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,191
but you've been a little drunk.

66
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,460
- And unreliable.
- Yes.

67
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,931
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely... reliable.

68
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,336
Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

69
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,505
It wasn't Marina's spell. It's mine.

70
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,608
She stole it from my private collection.

71
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:25,111
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

72
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,480
on prohibited magic, you would know

73
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,116
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

74
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,185
It is incredibly delicate.

75
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,120
- We... we know that, but...
- But what?

76
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,688
But you want to rid yourself

77
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:38,324
of the one thing we all
so desperately want?

78
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,160
- If you understood what...
- You understand.

79
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,329
I'm a Magician with no magic.

80
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,832
A dean without a school.

81
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,467
Just a blind, unemployed

82
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:51,270
black man in America.

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,576
Which, shockingly, was actually
being kept 38% more tolerant

84
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,477
through a series of enchantments

85
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,677
which have now died.

86
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:02,915
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

87
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,958
- in a position to need to.
- Okay, you're really drunk.

88
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,060
So what?

89
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,256
What does it matter?

90
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,225
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

91
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,826
than to attempt this.

92
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,546
You want to blow yourselves up?
Is that it?

93
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,509
Um. Just give me one second.

94
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,173
Okay.

95
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,234
Uh, they'll hold for a day or two,

96
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,044
but then Alice can recharge them.

97
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,940
After we finish the transfer.

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,110
I know. Everything is fucked.

99
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,579
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

100
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,273
Julia.

101
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,949
Yeah, well, it's not
<i>not</i> my fault, either so.

102
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,986
What you two utter idiots need,

103
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:15,755
if you don't want to die,

104
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,757
is the flesh of a magical creature

105
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,960
to act as a sort of semiconductor.

106
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,638
A potent energy-drainer. An incubus.

107
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:30,770
<i>If this is about the whole</i>

108
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,204
marriage not being consummated yet,

109
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:33,906
don't worry, it'll happen.

110
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,642
Oh, no, no, no.
You misunderstand me, my dear.

111
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,245
You see, I've heard a rumor
about your advisor,

112
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,914
the Pickwick?
Sighted in a certain corridor.

113
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,616
Taking scrapings from the wall.

114
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,484
He's just a compulsive redecorator.

115
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:48,154
You might be interested to
know that we both have been

116
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,756
plotting against our mutual friend.

117
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,261
No idea what you're talking about.

118
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,630
Margo.

119
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,165
You can trust me.

120
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,133
The misguided actions of my son

121
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:04,837
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

122
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:08,883
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

123
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,609
When the time is right,

124
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,021
we could use it to kill the Fairy Queen.

125
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,854
- Hi.
- Oh, hell no.

126
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,589
Move.

127
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,992
Hang your sheets out
the window afterwards, dear.

128
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,060
Guards! Guards!

129
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,196
Don't even think about closing it. No!

130
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:33,366
Guards!

131
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:36,477
Let me out!

133
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,016
<i>I don't give a shit
if you have to find someone</i>

134
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,584
to sell those shares short.

135
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,227
I need them today.

136
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:56,259
So the Incubus
is a hedge fund manager?

137
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,458
Plus 5%. And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

138
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,527
Just remember what Fogg said.

139
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,863
Be respectful, no matter what.

140
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,398
You got two minutes.

141
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,767
Henry Fogg said that you might be able

142
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,502
to help us power our spell.

143
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,339
Uh, we just... we need
to use your thing.

144
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,875
- My what?
- Uh, your... your thing.

145
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,511
Your... your business.

146
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,179
- Sorry?
- Uh.

147
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,816
Your little friend.
Uh, I mean... your big friend.

148
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,918
Well, I'm... I'm sure your friend

149
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,054
is perfectly proportioned to your body.

150
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:32,124
- I was just saying...
- Your penis.

151
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:35,861
Yep, we need to use your penis
to power our spell.

152
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,730
And we know that you need it too.

153
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,932
So that's why we'll build
the spell around it.

154
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,434
It'll be completely painless

155
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,010
and should only take a couple minutes.

156
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:57,983
I can't believe that actually worked!

157
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,985
Wha... what actually worked?

158
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,822
I planted this joke on Fogg
25 years ago.

159
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:05,157
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

160
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,326
Wait, so you...
you don't have a magic...

161
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,564
Of course not.

162
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,096
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

163
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,897
I mean you're an incubus.

164
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,400
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

165
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,435
Gods no.

166
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,803
I don't even like sex.

167
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:22,174
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

168
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,476
May I?

169
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,551
Oh, and you.

170
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:35,020
You got a lot of it, I can tell.

171
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,960
Delish.

172
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,863
You give me
a few more hits of this,

173
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,297
and I'll give you something

174
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,574
that'll actually power your spell.

175
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,143
- Is that your tail?
- Yeah.

176
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,886
Yeah, I grow a new one every spring.

177
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,549
Welcome back.

178
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,318
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

179
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,788
You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

180
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,958
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

181
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:16,136
and unforeseen seafaring... confusion.

182
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:20,412
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

183
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:22,001
- of course...
- No, you won't.

184
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,670
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

185
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,507
The Stone Queen has locked
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

186
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,709
Wait. What? Why?

187
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:34,313
She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

188
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,249
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

189
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,018
just as much as the Floaters do.

190
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,853
Listen, pro tip.

191
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,988
Let Margo out of there immediately.

192
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:45,191
You know her. Force isn't going to work.

193
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:48,527
True. Force may not work.

194
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,530
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

195
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,998
I am not going to coerce Margo

196
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,934
into having sex with a 15-year-old.

197
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,495
Have you never heard of statutory rape?

198
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:59,772
- Fomar isn't a statue.
- That is not what...

199
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,240
Forget it.

200
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,943
You will solve this problem for me.

201
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,452
And if I refuse?

202
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:12,618
I've been searching for a new keepsake.

203
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,553
Several bits will do.

204
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,256
Fine, but I have a feeling Queen Margo

205
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,758
is going to be a little bit difficult.

206
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,561
I know!

207
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,663
You hate me for killing Micah.

208
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:26,532
Jesus Christ.

209
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,800
It's just in our culture,

210
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,370
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

211
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,239
Most of us wind up

212
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,141
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

213
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,244
Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

214
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,179
No.

215
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,580
So, do you want to take a break?

216
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,182
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

217
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,251
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

218
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:46,819
into a decorative, whimsical planter?

219
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,421
How are we supposed to become one flesh

220
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:51,423
if you won't let me touch you?

221
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,292
- We're not.
- But you're my wife.

222
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,893
Oh, please.

223
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,729
You don't need a wife.

224
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,031
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

225
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,434
What's a sex class? Who... who's Ed?

226
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,069
It's something they make you
do on Earth.

227
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,412
It makes you never wanna.

228
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,216
How about I show you?

229
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,483
Vaginas.

230
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,286
The leading cause of death in men.

231
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,421
They spread disease.

232
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,623
They explode during childbirth.

233
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,662
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

234
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,498
In fact, mine's doing it right now.

235
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,375
Well, that's okay. I like blood.

236
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,614
But do you like teeth?

237
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,811
Sorry I'm late.

238
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,179
You okay?

239
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,548
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

240
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,650
This uniform is, like, really sweaty.

241
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,786
Yeah, I know, but it beats

242
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,570
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

243
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,190
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

244
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,559
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

245
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:03,462
Uh, okay, so I'm pretty sure that

246
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,164
the fourth key is somewhere

247
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,132
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

248
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,468
Um, it's an uncharted region of Fillory

249
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,138
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

250
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,975
Um, but, you know, we get to go

251
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:21,280
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

252
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,383
Uh, yeah. I wish I could.

253
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:27,252
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

254
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:29,688
- And I can't leave Margo.
- Right, of course.

255
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,824
- Sorry.
- No.

256
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,226
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

257
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,902
Who wouldn't?

258
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,099
Uh, think about it.
You can take Benedict.

259
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,735
Go be life-partners with
someone else for a little bit.

260
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:46,038
But you'll be able to do the...
thing on the prow of a ship

261
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:47,706
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

262
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,784
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

263
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,367
Whoo!

264
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,176
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

265
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,387
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

266
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:46,064
Being on a mission is a hell
of an antidepressant.

267
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,399
You notice that, Benedict?

268
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,142
Well, now that you mention it.

269
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,805
Whoa.

270
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,514
We're entering The Abyss, Sire.

271
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:00,520
It'll be darkness from here on.

272
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,559
Thank you.

273
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,164
So how long until we can keep going?

274
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,667
As soon as we find safe
passage, your Majesty.

275
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,836
Is someone out there?

276
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,445
Help!

277
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,450
Is someone out there? Help!

278
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,524
God, I think there's someone
out there on a raft.

279
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,958
You okay?

280
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,259
Wow, wow, wow.

281
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,595
You just saved the shit out of me.

282
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,363
Poppy Kline.

283
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,399
Draconologist, postgraduate
fellow, and field researcher

284
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,468
at your service.

285
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,813
Holy shit. You're from Brakebills?

286
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,148
Yeah.

287
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:08,646
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

288
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,680
Yeah. So hu-Shit.now.

289
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,016
I've stuck in The Abyss way too long.

290
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,483
How did you end up out here anyway?

291
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:15,124
Oh, I came with some other students.

292
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:17,821
Oh. Hey, sorry. I can, um... uh.

293
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:20,257
Spring Break, Class of 2016?

294
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,659
Didn't turn out so well for us,

295
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:23,727
but that is a whole nother story.

296
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:25,451
Wait, sorry.

297
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,682
Do you know, um...

298
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,561
If the next two words out
of your mouth are "Josh"

299
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:30,420
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

300
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,236
No way. He's still alive?

301
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:34,505
I mean, as far as I know.

302
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,106
Oh, that's amazing.

303
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:38,008
So how does a Brakebills student

304
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:40,511
wind up alone on a raft?

305
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,414
Get a girl a drink.
I'll tell you the whole story.

306
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:44,690
All right.

307
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:00,197
Your Majesty.

308
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,466
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

309
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:04,168
Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

310
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,536
High Queen Margo let him go

311
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:06,971
as he was innocent of all charges.

312
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:10,407
Oh, right. Yeah.

313
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,783
Sorry about that.

314
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,285
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

315
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:24,121
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

316
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,423
An hour's ride North, there is a forest

317
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,592
with naturally-occurring aphrodisiacs

318
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:31,328
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

319
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,564
Fine.

320
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:35,265
- But if you fail...
- I know, I know.

321
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,635
New keepsakes. Fingers, ears.

322
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,737
Try your spleen.

323
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:41,647
- Okay.
- Go.

324
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,776
Fieldwork was my thing at
Brakebills, and well, dragons.

325
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,244
Love them.

326
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:49,313
Wait, so what happened to your ship?

327
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,914
Oh, wrecked.

328
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:52,483
Off the coast of the Truthwaters.

329
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:55,285
I spent two years on that little Picket.

330
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,956
And, bam.
Over in an instant.

331
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,191
That was three weeks ago.

332
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:05,029
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

333
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,931
Yeah, it was rough.

334
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,066
Especially without magic.

335
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,701
Do you know anything about why the hell

336
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:13,070
- it just went out?
- I mean, um...

337
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,506
I just hope someone's fixing it.

338
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,776
That someone is, um, sort of me.

339
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:23,881
Um, I'm on a... a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

340
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,382
Right, so there's seven of them.

341
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,619
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Golden keys?

342
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,028
Like...

343
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,826
- Holy shit. How did you...
- Short version?

344
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,461
Stole it.

345
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:39,730
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

346
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,199
just, like, covered in treasure.

347
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,002
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

348
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:45,853
Spontaneous orgasm.

349
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,671
I mean, places like this are so rare.

350
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,339
There are only two species of dragon

351
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,024
that even build treasure-nests.

352
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,242
Anyway, this was in one of them

353
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,836
with a bunch of cool stuff.

354
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:57,663
But the thing that got me was

355
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,633
I could feel something coming off it.

356
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,757
- Yeah.
- Even now.

357
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,117
It's somehow not dead, right?

358
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,341
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

359
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,343
so I just took it.

360
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,780
Just like that?

361
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,213
I'm a person of questionable ethics.

362
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,891
Here.

363
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:20,127
It's yours, from one quester to another.

364
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,055
- Wow. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,914
So do you know what it does?
I mean, each one

366
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,894
sort of has a unique thing.

367
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,508
I don't know.

368
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,553
- Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,303
Uh, here's to that.

370
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,877
- You wanna? Yeah.
- Oh.

371
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,760
Okay. Well, here goes nothing.

372
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,662
Ugh, man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

373
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,497
You're gonna kill yourselves!

374
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:07,000
- Oh, my God. I can't...
- Golly Moses.

375
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,936
You're right. They're
gonna kill themselves.

376
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,371
Don't you have some shower to go haunt?

377
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,540
Oh, no one's showering right now.

378
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,676
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

379
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,845
Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

380
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:20,414
Ah, just a bit zozzled, I think.

381
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:23,617
He was quite naked.

382
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:26,495
Remarkably... well-preserved.

383
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:30,524
Guess it's possible to age gracefully.

384
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:31,782
Oh, my God.

385
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,774
Fuck, man. I can't watch this.

386
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,864
See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

387
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,592
You act like you don't care,

388
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,467
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

389
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,570
Yeah, then... then why
is everyone acting

390
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,486
like I'm not a part of it anymore?

391
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:49,533
Maybe it's time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

392
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:51,712
- You mean, leave?
- Why not?

393
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:53,547
Go... go find a story to watch

394
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:55,349
that doesn't make you so depressed.

395
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,418
Oh, I think they did it.

396
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm having a good time.

397
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:13,642
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close...

398
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:39,885
Rise and shine, princess.

399
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:43,080
Who?

400
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,149
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

401
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,846
to black out after, what, five drinks?

402
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:48,666
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

403
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:49,825
I don't...

404
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:53,391
Okay. Uh...

405
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:55,986
Um...

406
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,763
Seriously.

407
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:01,507
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

408
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:07,813
Sorry, um, can you... are
you... are you seeing this?

409
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:11,309
Nobody cares, dude.

410
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,145
They all have actual jobs, unlike you.

411
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:15,946
Right, okay.

412
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:17,489
No problem.

413
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:25,489
- What the fuck did you do?
- Okay, I can explain.

414
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,491
- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

415
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,694
- It's all right.
- There's another me.

416
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,996
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

417
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:33,698
Nothing about this is all right.

418
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,715
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

419
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:37,871
- The key does have a power.
- No shit.

420
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,803
It takes the darkest parts of you

421
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:42,973
and makes a... kind of...
well, you met it.

422
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:46,344
It's kind of like a depression monster?

423
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:50,081
Looks like you, talks like you.

424
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,284
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

425
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:55,319
- Unless...
- Unless?

426
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:56,420
Unless it gets in your head

427
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,022
and convinces you to hurt yourself.

428
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,627
- Well...
- But you'll be fine.

429
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,791
It only affects the last person
who touched the key.

430
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:03,861
So just pass it along to someone else.

431
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,997
- That's what we did.
- Who's we?

432
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,332
My former shipmates.

433
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:09,428
After I stole the key,

434
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,901
we passed it from person to person

435
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:14,138
until we, you know, ran out of options.

436
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:16,407
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

437
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,412
Um. Hit an iceberg?

438
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,211
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

439
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,514
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

440
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:25,182
You have to be, like, a badass about it,

441
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:27,084
and what can I say?

442
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:28,886
- They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

443
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:32,056
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

444
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:34,425
Eh. Maybe, like, half?

445
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,527
This key made half of your shipmates

446
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:38,863
kill themselves, and you gave it to me?

447
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,731
Yeah. But don't worry.

448
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:43,768
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

449
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:45,936
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

450
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:49,039
Mmmm, no. No, no.

451
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:51,275
I'm not. This is like...

452
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,710
It's like we're on a boat, okay?

453
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,412
This is not how I usually am.

454
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:56,213
You're usually
a wet blanket, self-pitying,

455
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:57,248
party pooping dickwad.

456
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:59,517
Shut up!

457
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,719
You better pass that along fast.

458
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:04,321
What? No! Not if there is a 50%

459
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:05,823
chance of it killing the next person.

460
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:10,261
Okay.

461
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:12,897
Right, yep. I'll just hold on to it.

462
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,965
Until we get back to Whitespire.

463
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:17,001
- I can do that.
- Your choice.

464
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:18,702
I mean, we're stuck in The Abyss

465
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:19,837
till we found our way out.

466
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:22,706
It could be days. It could be weeks.

467
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:24,742
Oh, but hey. Don't stress.

468
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,411
- You might be fine.
- You won't be.

469
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:29,280
You know what?

470
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,283
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

471
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,718
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

472
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:36,253
that I've got a black belt.

473
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:37,696
So come at me.

474
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:43,692
The problem is your hair.

475
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:45,470
I know you're just trying
to hide your face,

476
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,498
but it really only makes it worse.

477
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,099
Seriously, have you ever noticed

478
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,734
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

479
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:52,303
If feet had frown lines?

480
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,405
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

481
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:57,308
which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

482
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,977
Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

483
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:02,913
And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

484
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:04,615
a senile frowny foot-face.

485
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,925
Jesus. Fuck.

486
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:12,064
This is pointless. You can't run me off.

487
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,334
You can't eat me off.

488
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:18,537
You can't drink me off.

489
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:22,466
You can't jerk me off.

490
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:23,834
God, you're so vulgar.

491
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:26,637
We had a thing going,
and you... you made it

492
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,472
unnecessarily gross.

493
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:32,176
You sick of the shallow, petty stuff?

494
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:34,545
I get it.

495
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,413
The thing is, I start on the outside,

496
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:38,716
and I work my way into the core.

497
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:42,319
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

498
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,721
when you could have helped her,

499
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,588
that is what set her on that path.

500
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,958
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

501
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,521
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

502
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:54,614
You ruined her.

503
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,513
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

504
00:24:57,524 --> 00:25:00,080
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

505
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:04,208
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

506
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:05,778
Just stop!

507
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:08,513
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

508
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,724
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

509
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,982
But you are never gonna feel okay.

510
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:15,753
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

511
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,229
Quentin.

512
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,511
I am your head.

513
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,602
You know I'm right because I am you.

514
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:33,337
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

515
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:35,606
Fomar.

516
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,182
Bottoms up.

517
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,580
Uh, in my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

518
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,783
- Drink the wine, Margo.
- I don't wanna drink the wine.

519
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:47,934
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

520
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:49,744
You'll feel better if you just

521
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:52,864
drink the wine, Margo.

522
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:07,004
So, um...

523
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,443
Do we have sex in the carriage?

524
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:12,275
Or do we have sex outside?

525
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:16,413
- Or do...
- I'm not having sex with you.

526
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:19,883
You psychotic fetus.

527
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:21,460
Ever.

528
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,829
Either I just killed him with my rage

529
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,263
or you drugged his wine.

530
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,099
And to think...

531
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,908
- You doubted me.
- To think.

532
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:42,973
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

533
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:45,209
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

534
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,745
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

535
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:49,419
than sleeping beauty over here.

536
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,815
The fairies are up to something
in the Northern Orchards.

537
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:53,784
They evacuated the villagers weeks ago

538
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:55,953
and haven't let another human in since.

539
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:59,323
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

540
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,392
and he saw some crazy shit.

541
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,927
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

542
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:06,864
mutant plant life, Chernobyl-level shit.

543
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:09,867
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

544
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:13,437
Great, well, now I can't be mad at you.

545
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:14,880
Thanks.

546
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:16,755
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

547
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:19,043
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

548
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:21,712
- we could just...
- Be us again?

549
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:23,714
Who are we now, El?

550
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,149
We used to be glamorous,

551
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,885
amazing mega-bitches.

552
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,453
And now?

553
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:33,824
We have depth and character.

554
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:36,860
Let's decide... we'll find us again

555
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,163
once we're done saving Fillory.

556
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,472
Okay?

557
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:44,234
Duty calls.

558
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,144
Let's go see about these orchards.

559
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,453
Which are...

560
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:00,292
No longer here.

561
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,592
Nothing is going to save you.

562
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,960
Not Brakebills.

563
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,930
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

564
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,666
Just do it.

565
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,668
Kill yourself.

566
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:19,571
Make it stop.

567
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,481
You know the way out.

568
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,919
King Quentin, no!

569
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,054
Oh, no, I wasn't. I was just...

570
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:37,789
- I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

571
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,492
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

572
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,761
I thought about it too.

573
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:46,364
Though I've never spoken
about it, of course.

574
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:48,133
Why not?

575
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,170
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

576
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,209
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

577
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:00,946
and turn them into, um,
maps, for example.

578
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,215
Jesus, Benedict.

579
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,016
Okay, we should talk about this.

580
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,018
If it please you, Sire, but first,

581
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,128
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

582
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,627
Yeah. I don't really trust
myself right now.

583
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:20,365
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

584
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,867
the crew would tie them to the mast.

585
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,435
Isn't that funny?

586
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,604
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

587
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,043
- No... no, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

588
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,679
Okay, swear to me, no matter what I say,

589
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,750
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

590
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,254
Very well. I won't.

591
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:43,863
Thank you.

592
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,426
It worked.

593
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,856
Thank you.

594
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,109
Oh. I see the transfer worked.

595
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,312
It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

596
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,681
I hope you'll be careful.

597
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,517
I will be.

598
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:23,521
You know that fixing my glasses

599
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,757
won't fix me.

600
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,659
Yeah, but they make all of this

601
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:30,003
one speck less shitty.

602
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:39,278
It smells like the fairy realm.

603
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,607
We're so far North.

604
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:45,443
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

605
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:47,979
Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

606
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,549
All that spritzing and bathing.

607
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,885
You know, it's... it's like
they're afraid

608
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:56,763
to dry out in Fillory or something.

609
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,933
Oh, my God.

610
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:05,330
The fuckers are terraforming.

611
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,966
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

612
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,801
- That is not okay.
- No.

613
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,277
Definitely not.

614
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,007
That mushroom just moved.

615
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,217
- Really?
- Should I pluck it?

616
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,147
I'm... I'm gonna do it.

617
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:23,823
Mm. Margo, don't.

618
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:39,272
It's a fairy embryo.

619
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,701
- Really?
- These are eggs, El.

620
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,102
I mean, really?

621
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:45,937
The fairies aren't just terraforming.

622
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:48,173
They're growing an army.

623
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,515
Oh, fuck.

624
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,391
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

625
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:56,259
I mean, think about all the crazy shit

626
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,594
they've kept us busy with.

627
00:32:57,604 --> 00:33:01,598
Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

628
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:04,534
This is all just
a thin frosting of whimsy

629
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:07,704
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

630
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:11,074
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

631
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,610
We need a plan bigger than just
assassinating the Queen.

632
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,280
We need... we need... we
need... we need... we need...

633
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,258
We need... Margo?

634
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:24,388
Margo?

635
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,223
Kidnapping. Hostages. Leverage.

636
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,925
- Don't ask questions, go! Go!
- What the fuck?

637
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:31,102
Go, go!

638
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,040
It's a bitch, right?

639
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,075
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

640
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:46,410
Have you tried distracting it?

641
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,646
For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

642
00:33:49,656 --> 00:33:51,415
Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

643
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,150
Please, fuck off.

644
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,585
Look, I'm sorry I passed you the key.

645
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,087
I really thought you could handle it.

646
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,922
This is me handling it.

647
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:01,925
No, no, you're right.

648
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:04,227
I wish we'd thought of tying
ourselves up.

649
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,596
That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

650
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:08,565
That killed three of us off quick.

651
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:10,300
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

652
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,402
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

653
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:14,245
Others, it takes time to wear down.

654
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:20,477
You want me to take the key for a while?
Give you some relief?

655
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:22,846
No.

656
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:25,415
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

657
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:27,751
And I need it.

658
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,820
- For the quest.
- Fine.

659
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,022
Be a suffer-martyr.

660
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:33,757
Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

661
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,826
They help sometimes, too.

662
00:34:35,836 --> 00:34:39,096
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

663
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:40,597
Keyholes, like...

664
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:44,201
Like in the walls or clocks.

665
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,369
Don't ask me how it works.

666
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,705
So... so where do the keyholes go?

667
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:52,476
To Earth or the Neitherlands
or wherever.

668
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,686
Wait, wait. Are you serious?

669
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,528
Stop it. What are you doing?

670
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,267
I've been stuck here in
Fillory this whole time

671
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:04,588
when I could have gone home?

672
00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:07,190
Hey. No, Poppy, stop it.

673
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,793
Poppy, no. Stop.

674
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:12,229
Poppy!

675
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,431
I told you
you should've killed yourself.

676
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,077
Okay.

677
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:24,802
Okay, we just have one
outstanding problem.

678
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:26,543
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

679
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:28,753
Don't worry. I got this.

680
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:37,854
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

681
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:41,091
- They've got three eyes?
- No, baby.

682
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,934
They've got fangs.

683
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:52,369
Oh! Oh, something bit my manhood.

684
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:54,437
Congratulations, son. You just had sex.

685
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:56,339
The first time's always painful.

686
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:58,608
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

687
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:02,245
But, hey, you were amazing.

688
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,447
What?

689
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,157
I like to watch.

690
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:10,086
Wanna go again?

691
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:14,324
Benedict!

692
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,796
Benedict, help!

693
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,544
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my God, Benedict.

694
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,818
- Okay, untie me.
- Sire, you said not to untie you.

695
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,303
No. No, no, no, no, no. Please, come on.
Okay, look.

696
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:27,871
I'm not trying to kill myself.

697
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,773
Poppy took the key, and she is trying

698
00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:31,308
to use it to get back to Earth.

699
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:33,176
Just... okay, go find her yourself.

700
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:35,779
Just whatever you do, do not
let her leave with that key.

701
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:37,021
Yes, Your Majesty.

702
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:40,225
God.

703
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:45,255
No! Stop!

704
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:59,544
- Hey, did you get it?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

705
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,607
I'm a terrible failure.

706
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:05,850
Okay. It's okay.

707
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,720
We'll get the key back somehow.

708
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:18,162
Benedict.

709
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,860
Hey, hey. Benedict.

710
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,762
Whoa, Benedict, no. Hey, listen.

711
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:29,466
Whatever it's telling you
to do, do not do it.

712
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:31,835
I'm sorry.

713
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:33,177
Benedict, no!

714
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:46,791
Mm. Yummy.

720
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:13,780
Penny, what's wrong?

721
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,780
- Just saying goodbye.
- What?

722
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,116
Goodbye? Where are you going?

723
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,519
Just away.

724
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,622
Away... wait.

725
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,176
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um. I don't understand.

726
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:26,971
Is this because
of what happened with Kady?

727
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:28,340
- No.
- Okay.

728
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,708
Is it because we did the transfer?

729
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:31,860
No. Look, I gotta go.

730
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,612
Wait, will you just
talk to me for a second?

731
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:36,147
You know what,
we barely know each other.

732
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:39,017
Don't suddenly act like
you care just 'cause I'm going.

733
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,221
I'm not acting.

734
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:43,299
I do care. I don't want to see you go.
I don't want to see you give up.

735
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,636
- Give up?
- Yeah.

736
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:49,841
You're the one who had magic,
and you gave it away.

737
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:52,712
What's your plan? Go back to law school?

738
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,598
Live off your trust fund?

739
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:57,202
Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

740
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:59,532
and try to remember what life was like

741
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:01,902
without a god or a quest.

742
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:03,775
Or some dead asshole bothering me.

743
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:05,410
And, I don't know, frankly beyond that,

744
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,811
it's none of your business.

745
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:09,581
'Cause you have nothing beyond that.

746
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:17,830
Penny wants to say goodbye.

747
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:23,795
- You're leaving?
- I can't do this anymore.

748
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:27,573
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

749
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:34,773
Why don't I just make you a new body?

750
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:36,516
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

751
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:56,461
A-plus job

752
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:59,230
getting rid of me, gorgeous.

753
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,145
Is this just a dream?

754
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:04,116
That time you fell out
of a tree when you were 12.

755
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:08,840
The bone in your arm healed
in six little weeks.

756
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,351
How come your fear of heights never did?

757
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,358
I'm not the bone.

758
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:21,728
I'm the terror.

759
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:26,291
I do love how you keep trying.

760
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:32,831
And trying. And trying.

761
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,006
I have not been punched

762
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:42,340
that hard since Burning Man.

763
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,351
Where is he? Where did he go?

764
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:48,621
Why does it smell like barbeque?

765
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:55,011
Benedict is dead,
and best-case-scenario,

766
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,549
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

767
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,623
- Um, Quentin.
- Don't talk to me.

768
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:00,658
- Please, I mean it.
- Okay.

769
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,425
Just... Just one thing

770
00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:04,329
and I swear I will never
talk to you again.

771
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:05,463
What?

772
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:07,532
Dragons don't shit.

773
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,501
Okay, great, fun fact. Thanks.

774
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:11,236
No one knows exactly how it works,

775
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:13,905
but what they ingest goes elsewhere.

776
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:15,540
They're gatekeepers, you know?

777
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,308
They don't just make portals.

778
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,310
They are portals.

779
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,714
So, actual best-case-scenario...

780
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:25,483
The key went to the Underworld.

781
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:27,994
- Mm.
- Oh, my God.

782
00:41:35,003 --> 00:41:36,561
If you're here, I'm practicing

783
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:38,963
an Osseus Confervium. Bone-knitting.

784
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:40,765
First step to building a new body.

785
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:45,537
I know you can't see me, but I'm here.

786
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,113
Thanks for giving a shit about me.

787
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,812
Alice?

788
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,348
Alice, you okay? Alice?

789
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,251
God, Alice. Alice!

790
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:03,455
God, this is... where's...

791
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,223
Alice!

792
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,564
Okay, okay, God. Come on.

793
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:15,975
Come on, someone's got
