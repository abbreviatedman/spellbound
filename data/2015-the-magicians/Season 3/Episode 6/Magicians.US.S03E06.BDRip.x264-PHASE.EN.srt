it has the power

to reveal things
that are hidden.

00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,725
I spent months
trying to push things.

10
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:16,988
I never got anywhere.

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,394
Until I tried
being the thing.

Holy zerts! You did it!

to throw out food

and replace it with, uh...
MARGO: inedible mushrooms.

16

There's this old hedge story
I once heard

00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,544
about some sort
of electrical transfer

32
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,056
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,218
Just look.

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,295
So, you want us
to reverse engineer

using kids' toys?

37
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,201

I've been trying to warn you

Being the fish button is the first thing
in this entire room that's worked.

Couple months back

I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,699
do the transfer,
and by the end of it,

64
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,778
everyone was on fire.

00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,538
Trust me.
Fogg was right.

66
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,616
It's a bad idea.

67
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,385
Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

68
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,543
Oh...

telling me?

Don't take this
the wrong way,

a little drunk.

74

Yes.

75
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely reliable.

76
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,973
Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

77
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,168
It wasn't Marina's spell.
It's mine.

78
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,474
She stole it from
my private collection.

79
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,646
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

80
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,152
on prohibited magic,
you would know

81
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,654
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

82
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,713
It is incredibly delicate.

83

But what?

84
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,319

we all so desperately want?

You understand.

being kept 38% more tolerant

of enchantments

94
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,417

or perhaps maybe you weren't

you need it too.

It'll be completely painless

00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,864
Gods no.

180
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,770
I don't even like sex.

181
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,803
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

182
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,041
May I?

183
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,109
(SNIFFS)

184
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,984
(EXHALES LOUDLY)

185
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,382
(CHUCKLES)

186
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,151
oh, and you.

187
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,693
You got a lot of it,
I can tell.

188
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,225
(SNIFFS)

189
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,626
(EXHALES)

190
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,290
Delish.

191
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,559
(SNIFFLES) You give me
a few more hits of this,

192
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,897
and I'll give you something

193
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,199
that'll actually
power your spell.

194
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,815
Is that your tail?
Yeah.

195
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,646
Yeah, I grow
a new one every spring.

196
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,153
Welcome back.

197
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,918
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

198
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,324
You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

199
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,660
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

200
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,860
and unforeseen
seafaring confusion.

201
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,865
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

202
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,667
of course...
No, you won't

203
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,175
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

204
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,169
The Stone Queen has locked

205
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,076
Margo and Fomar
in the dungeon.

206
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,238
Wait. What? Why?

207
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,079
She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

208
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,883
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

209
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,685
just as much
as the Floaters do.

210
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,448
Listen, pro tip.

211
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,685
Let Margo
out of there immediately.

212
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,855
You know her.
Force isn't going to work.

213
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,900
True. Force may not work.

214
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,102
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

215
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,694
I am not going
to coerce Margo

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,637
into having sex
with a 15-year-old.

217
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,366
Have you never heard
of statutory rape?

218
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,309
Fomar isn't a statue.
That is not what...

219
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,208
Forget it. You will solve
this problem for me.

220
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,108
And if I refuse?

221
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,316
I've been searching
for a new keepsake.

222
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,116
Several bits will do.

223
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,319
Fine, but I have
a feeling Queen Margo

224
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,328
is going to be
a little bit difficult.

225
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,327
FOMAR: I know!

226
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,232
You hate me
for killing Micah.

227
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, Jesus Christ.

228
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,768
It's just, in our culture,

229
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,968
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

230
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,908
Most of us wind up

231
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,811
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

232
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,905
Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

233
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,106
No.

234
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,146
So, do you want
to take a break?

235
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,986
Let me touch
your maiden peaks?

236
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,919
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

237
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,356
into a decorative,
whimsical planter?

238
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,018
How are we supposed
to become one flesh

239
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,027
if you won't let me
touch you?

240
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,922
We're not.
But you're my wife.

241
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,497
Oh, please.

242
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,128
You don't need a wife.

243
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,104
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

244
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,300
What's a sex class?
Who's Ed?

245
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,774
It's something they make you
do on Earth.

246
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,105
It makes you never wanna.

247
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,972
How about I show you?

248
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,117
Vaginas.

249
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,624
The leading cause
of death in men.

250
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,683
They spread disease.

251
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,886
They explode
during childbirth.

252
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,229
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

253
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,469
In fact, mine's doing it
right now.

254
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,037
Well, that's okay.
I like blood.

255
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,042
But do you like teeth?

256
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,177
(EXHALES) Sorry I'm late.

257
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,574
You okay?

258
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,154
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

259
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,212
This uniform is, like,
really sweaty.

260
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,314
Yeah, I know, but it beats

261
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,223
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

262
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,353
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

263
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,087
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

264
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,026
Uh, okay, so
I'm pretty sure that

265
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,830
the fourth key is somewhere

266
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,395
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

267
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,405
Um, it's an uncharted
region of Fillory

268
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,841
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

269
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,037
Um...

270
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,513
But, you know,
we get to go

271
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,916
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

272
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,784
Yeah. l wish I could.

273
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,922
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

274
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,290
And I can't leave Margo.
Right, of course.

275
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,363
Sorry.
No.

276
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,898
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

277
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,524
Who wouldn't?

278
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,860
Think about it.
You can take Benedict.

279
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,366
Go be life partners with
someone else for a little bit.

your whole life to do.

00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,439

You know, the thing.

283
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,920

00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,936
Well, now that
you mention it.

290
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,439
Whoa.

294
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,901
So how long
until we can keep going?

295
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,336
As soon as we find
safe passage, Your Majesty.

Holy shit.
You're from Brakebills?

308
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,944
Yeah.

309
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,746
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

310
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,879
Yeah.
Shit.

311
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,925
I've been stuck in The Abyss
way too long.

312
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,186
How did you end up
out here anyway?

313
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,557

with some other students.

so well for us,

00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,265
but that is a whole
'nother story.

318
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,794
Wait, sorry.

319
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,235
Do you know, um...

320
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,740
If the next two words
out of your mouth are "Josh"

321
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,038
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,101
No way. He's still alive?

323

I mean, as far as I know.

324
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,045
Oh, that's amazing.

325
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,743
So how does
a Brakebills student

326
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,083
wind up alone on a raft?

Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,339
High Queen Margo let him go

334
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,742
as he was innocent
of all charges.

335
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,946
Oh, right. Yeah.

336
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,613
Sorry about that.

337
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:24,152
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

338
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,026
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

An hour's ride north,
there is a forest

00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,426
with naturally-occurring
aphrodisiacs

341
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,199
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,202

That was three weeks ago.

355
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,797
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

356
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,834
Yeah, it was rough.

357
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,237
Especially without magic.

358
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,537
Do you know anything
about why the hell

359
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,136
it just went out?
I mean...

360
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,341
I just hope
someone's fixing it.

361
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,146
That someone is, um,
sort of me.

362
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,820
I'm on a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

363
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,256
Right, so there's
seven of them.

364
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,226
Wait, wait, wait' wait.
Golden keys?

365
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,825
Like...

366
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,529
Holy shit. How did you...

367
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,591
Short version?

368
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,063
Stole it.

369
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,532
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

370
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,098
just, like,
covered in treasure.

371
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,369
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

372
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,211
Ah. Spontaneous orgasm.

373
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,514
I mean, places like this
are so rare.

374
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,208
There are only
two species of dragon

375
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,511
that even build
treasure-nests.

376
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,712
Anyway, this was
in one of them

377
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,550
with a bunch of cool stuff.

378
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,250
But the thing
that got me was

379
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,848
I could feel something
coming off it.

380
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,224
Yeah.
Even now.

381
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,422
It's somehow
not dead, right?

382
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,564
And, you know, the dragons
were all horny and distracted,

383
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,226
so I just took it.

384
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,063
Just like that?

385
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,271
I'm a person of questionable ethics.
(CHUCKLES)

386
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,231
Here.

387
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,608
It's yours,
from one quester to another.

388
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,745
Wow. Thank you.

389
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,640
So do you know what it does?

390
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,220
I mean, each one sort of
has a unique thing.

391
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,448
I don't know.

392
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,451
Maybe you can figure it out.
Yeah.

393
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,490
Uh... Here's to that.

394
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,225

You wanna? Yeah.
Oh.

397
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,134
Okay.
Well, here goes nothing.

Ugh. Man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,652
You're gonna
kill yourselves!

402

Oh, my God. I can't...
Golly Moses.

403
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,259
You're right.
They're gonna kill themselves.

404
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,593
Don't you have some shower
to go haunt?

405
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,428
Oh, no one's
showering right now.

406
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,699
Except Fogg'
and he's asleep.

407
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,599
Jesus' that man needs help.
Is he all right?

408
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,640
Just a bit zozzled, I think.

409
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,434
He was quite naked.
(CHUCKLES)

410
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,702
Remarkably well-preserved.

411
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,346
Guess it's possible
to age gracefully.

412
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:33,978
PENNY: Oh, my God.

413
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,020
Fuck, man.
I can't watch this.

414
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,388
See'? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

415
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,855
You act
like you don't care,

416
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,654
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

417
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,726
Yeah, then... Then why
is everyone acting

418
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,695
like I’m not a part
of it anymore?

419
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:52,167
Maybe ifs time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

420
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,826
You mean, leave?
Why not?

421
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,702
Go find a story to watch

422
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,536

so depressed.

(STUTTERS) Who?

431
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,726
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

432

to black out after,
what, five drinks?

433
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,524
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

434

00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,036
Seriously.

00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,067
You hold your liquor

Sorry, um, can you... Are you...
Are you seeing this?

Nobody cares, dude.

441
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,887
They all have actual jobs,
unlike you.

442
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,385
Right, okay.

443
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,986
No problem.

444
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,065
What the fuck did you do?
Okay, I can explain.

445
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,067
What is this key?
Just calm down.

446
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,433
It's all right.
There's another me.

447
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,631
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

448
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,435
Nothing about this
is all right.

449
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,271
Okay, listen.
Here's the deal.

450
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,804
The key does have a power.
No shit.

451
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,471
It takes the darkest parts
of you

452
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,482
and makes a kind of...
Well, you met it.

453
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,946
It's kind of like
a depression monster?

454
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,649
Looks like you,
talks like you.

455
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,258
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

456
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,929
Unless...
Unless?

457
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,463
Unless it gets in your head

458
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,657
and convinces you
to hurt yourself.

459
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,495
Well...
But you'll be fine.

460
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,500
It only affects the last
person who touched the key.

461
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,537
So just <i>pass</i> it along
to someone else.

462
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,664
That's what we did.
Who's we?

463
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,935
My former shipmates.

464
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,442
After I stole the key,

465
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,842
we passed it
from person to person

466
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,778
until we, you know,
ran out of options.

467
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,010
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

468
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,273
Um...

469
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,819
Hit an iceberg?

470
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,848
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

471
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,946
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

472
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,819
You have to be, like,
a badass about it,

473
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,724
and what can I say?

474
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,557
They were weak.
Okay, I'm sorry.

475
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,689
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

476
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,026
Hmm. Maybe, like, half?

477
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,065
This key made half
of your shipmates

478
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,537
kill themselves,
and you gave it to me?

479
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,471
Yeah. But don't worry.

480
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,340
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

481
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,638
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

482
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,647
No. No, no.

483
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,876
I'm not. This is like...

484
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,419
It's like
we're on a boat, okay?

485
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,010
This is not how I usually am.

Shut up!

489
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,424
You better pass that
along fast.

490
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,895
What? No!
Not if there is a 50%

491
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,523
chance of it killing
the next person.

to Whitespire.

I can do that.

00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,603

You know what?

504
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,686
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

505
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,256
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

that I've got a black belt.

507
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,260
So come at me.

508

Know you're just trying
to hide your face,

510

but it really only
makes it worse.

511

have you ever noticed

512
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,276
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

aging prematurely,

which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

516

Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

517

And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

I start on the outside,

530
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,125
and I work my way
into the core.

531
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,955
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

532
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,292
when you could have
helped her,

533
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,698
that is what set her
on that path.

534
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,293
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

535
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,199
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

536
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,639
You ruined her.

537
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,210
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

538
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,871
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

539
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,940
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

540
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,678
Just stop!

541
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,982
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

542
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,650
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

543
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,693
But you are never
gonna feel okay.

544
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,319
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

545
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,961
Quentin.

546
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,233
lam your head.

547
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:27,304
You know I'm right
because I am you.

548
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,836
To Mr. and Mrs...
Fomar.

549
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,709
Fomar.

550
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,544
Bottoms up.

551
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,186
In my culture, the woman
always drinks first.

552
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,717
Drink the wine, Margo.

553
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,349
L don’t wanna
drink the wine.

554
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,759
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

555
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,591
You'll feel better
if you just

556
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,666
drink the wine, Margo.

557
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,675
(COUGHS)

558
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,841
So, um...

559
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,112
Do we have sex
in the carriage?

560
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,913
Or do we have sex outside?

561
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:20,047
Or do...
I'm not having sex with you.

562
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,355
You psychotic fetus.

563
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,126
Ever.

564
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,402
Either I just killed him
with my rage

565
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,940
or you drugged his wine.

566
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,770
And to think.“

567
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:39,968
You doubted me.

568
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,066
To think.

569
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,579
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

570
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,877
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

571
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,285
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

572
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,219
than sleeping beauty
over here.

573
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,279
The fairies
are up to something

574
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,380
in the Northern Orchards.

575
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,324
They evacuated the villagers
weeks ago

576
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,657
and haven't lei another
human in since.

577
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,960
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

578
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,057
and he saw some crazy shit.

579
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,468
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

580
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,438
mutant plant life,
Chernobyl-level shit.

581
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,443
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

582
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,605
Great, well,
now I can't be mad at you.

583
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,274
Thanks.

584
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,681
I know,
I wanted to fight, too,

585
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,809
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

586
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,081
we could just...
Be us again?

587
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,314
Who are we now, El?

588
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,823
We used to be glamorous,

589
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,825
amazing mega-bitches.

590
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,928
And now?

591
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,759
We have depth and character.

592
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,437
Let's decide...
We'll find us again

593
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,836
once we're done
saving Fillory.

594
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,168
Okay?

595
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,336
(HORSE NEIGHING)

596
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,933
Duty calls.

597
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,946
Let's go see
about these orchards.

598
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,714
Which are...

599
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,620
No longer here.

600
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,027
Nothing is going to save you.
Not Brakebills.

601
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,470
Not Fillory.
Not a quest.

602
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,335
Just do it.

603
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,343
Kill yourself.

604
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,675
Make it stop.

605
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,377
You know the way out.

606
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,984
BENEDICT: King Quentin, no!

607
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,187
No, l wasn’t. l was just...

608
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,897
I thought I saw something.
Your Majesty,

609
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,332
if I may' I understand
what you're contemplating.

610
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,203
I thought about it too.

611
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,906
Though I have never spoken
about it, of course.

612
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,000
Why not?

613
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,508
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

614
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:01,716
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

615
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:06,016
and turn them into maps,
for example.

616
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,590
Jesus, Benedict.

617
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,088
Okay, we should
talk about this.

618
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,093
If it please you, Sire,
but first,

619
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,255
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

620
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,796
Yeah. I don't really
trust myself right now.

621
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,206
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

622
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,535
the crew would tie them
to the mast. (CHUCKLES)

623
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,972
Isn't that funny?

624
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,569
Oh, my God.
Tie me to the mast.

625
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:31,972
(CHUCKLES)

626
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,652
No... No, Your Majesty.
No, do it.

627
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,815
Okay, swear to me,
no matter what I say,

628
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,482
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

629
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,895
Very well. I won't.

630
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,763
Thank you.

631
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,920
It worked.

632
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,830
Thank you.

Oh, I see
the transfer worked.

636
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,413
It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

637
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,013
L hope you'll be careful.

638
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,814
I will be.

639
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:28,324
You know that
fixing my glasses

640
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,893
won't fix me.

641
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,699
Yeah, but they make
all of this

642
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,328
one speck less shitty.

00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,345
MARGO: It smells like
the fairy realm.

645
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,448
We're so far north.

646
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,516
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

647
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,953
Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

648
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,386
All that spritzing
and bathing.

649
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,093
You know, it's...
It's like they're afraid

650
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,790
to dry out
in Fillory or something.

651
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,932
Oh, my God.

652
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,233
The fuckers are terraforming.

653
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,203
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

654
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,801
That is not okay.
No.

655
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,410
Definitely not.

656
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,583
That mushroom just moved.

00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,150

Should I pluck it?

on.

aren't just terraforming.

Oh, fuck.

668
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,522
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

all the crazy shit

Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

a thin frosting of whimsy

just assassinating the Queen.

We need... We need...

Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

Have you tried
distracting it?

For some reason, mine was
really into seagulls.

Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

you could handle it.

No, no, you're right.

692
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,720
I wish we'd thought
of tying ourselves up.

693
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,159
That first day'
we passed it around randomly.

694
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,891
That killed three of us
off quick.

695
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,727
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

696
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,767
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

697
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,394
Others, it takes time
to wear down.

698
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,605
You want me to take the key
for a while?

699
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,869
Give you some relief?

No.

701
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,607
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

702
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,439
And I need it.

703
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,010
For the quest. (EXHALES)
Fine.

00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,284
Look, the keys don't
