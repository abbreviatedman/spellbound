00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:55,285
I spent two years on that little Picket.

357
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,956
And, bam. [SNAPS FINGERS]
Over in an instant.

358
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,191
That was three weeks ago.

359
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:05,029
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

360
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,931
Yeah, it was rough.

361
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,066
Especially without magic.

362
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,701
Do you know anything about why the hell

363
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:13,070
- it just went out?
- I mean, um...

364
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,506
I just hope someone's fixing it.

365
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,776
That someone is, um, sort of me.

366
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:23,881
Um, I'm on a... a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

367
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,382
Right, so there's seven of them.

368
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,619
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Golden keys?

369
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,028
Like...

370
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,826
- Holy shit. How did you...
- Short version?

371
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,461
Stole it.

372
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:39,730
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

373
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,199
just, like, covered in treasure.

374
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,002
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

375
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:45,853
Spontaneous orgasm.

376
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,671
I mean, places like this are so rare.

377
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,339
There are only two species of dragon

378
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,024
that even build treasure-nests.

379
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,242
Anyway, this was in one of them

380
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,836
with a bunch of cool stuff.

381
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:57,663
But the thing that got me was

382
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,633
I could feel something coming off it.

383
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,757
- Yeah.
- Even now.

384
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,117
It's somehow not dead, right?

385
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,341
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

386
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,343
so I just took it.

387
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,780
Just like that?

388
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,213
I'm a person of questionable ethics.

389
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,891
[CHUCKLES] Here.

390
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:20,127
It's yours, from one quester to another.

391
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,055
- Wow. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,914
So do you know what it does?
I mean, each one

393
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,894
sort of has a unique thing.

394
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,508
I don't know.

395
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,553
- Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

396
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,303
Uh, here's to that.

Okay. Well, here goes nothing.

- Oh, my God. I can't...
- Golly Moses.

You're right. They're
gonna kill themselves.

Don't you have some shower to go haunt?

407
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,540
Oh, no one's showering right now.

408
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,676
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:20,414
Ah, just a bit zozzled, I think.

He was quite naked. [CHUCKLES]

Remarkably... well-preserved.

Oh, my God.

See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

You act like you don't care,

but really, you care most
in this whole story.

419
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,570
Yeah, then... then why
is everyone acting

420
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,486
like I'm not a part of it anymore?

421
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:49,533
Maybe it's time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

- Why not?

to black out after, what, five drinks?

to embarrass yourself?

- Okay, I can explain.

- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

- The key does have a power.
- No shit.

- Well...
- But you'll be fine.

It only affects the last person
who touched the key.

So just pass it along to someone else.

- They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

I have come up against you
before, asshole.

So come at me.

to hide your face,

00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,413
The thing is, I start on the outside,

532
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:38,716
and I work my way into the core.

533
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:42,319
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

534
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,721
when you could have helped her,

535
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,588
that is what set her on that path.

536
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,958
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

537
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,521
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

538
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:54,614
You ruined her.

539
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,513
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

540
00:24:57,524 --> 00:25:00,080
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

541
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:04,208
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

542
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:05,778
Just stop!

543
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:08,513
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

544
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,724
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

545
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,982
But you are never gonna feel okay.

546
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:15,753
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

547
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,229
Quentin.

548
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,511
I am your head.

549
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,602
You know I'm right because I am you.

550
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:33,337
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

551
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:35,606
Fomar.

552
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,182
Bottoms up.

553
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,580
Uh, in my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

554
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,783
- Drink the wine, Margo.
- I don't wanna drink the wine.

555
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:47,934
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

556
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:49,744
You'll feel better if you just

557
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:52,864
drink the wine, Margo.

558
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:03,642
[COUGHING]

559
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:07,004
So, um...

560
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,443
Do we have sex in the carriage?

561
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:12,275
Or do we have sex outside?

562
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:16,413
- Or do...
- I'm not having sex with you.

563
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:19,883
You psychotic fetus.

564
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:21,460
Ever.

565
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,829
Either I just killed him with my rage

566
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,263
or you drugged his wine.

567
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,099
And to think... [SIGHS]

568
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,908
- You doubted me.
- To think.

569
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:42,973
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

570
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:45,209
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

571
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,745
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

572
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:49,419
than sleeping beauty over here.

573
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,815
The fairies are up to something
in the Northern Orchards.

574
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:53,784
They evacuated the villagers weeks ago

575
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:55,953
and haven't let another human in since.

576
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:59,323
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

577
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,392
and he saw some crazy shit.

578
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,927
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

579
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:06,864
mutant plant life, Chernobyl-level shit.

580
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:09,867
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

581
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:13,437
Great, well, now I can't be mad at you.

582
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:14,880
Thanks.

583
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:16,755
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

584
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:19,043
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

585
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:21,712
- we could just...
- Be us again?

586
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:23,714
Who are we now, El?

587
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,149
We used to be glamorous,

588
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,885
amazing mega-bitches.

589
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,453
And now?

590
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:33,824
We have depth and character.

591
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:36,860
Let's decide... we'll find us again

592
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,163
once we're done saving Fillory.

593
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,472
Okay?

594
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:44,234
Duty calls.

595
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,144
Let's go see about these orchards.

596
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,453
Which are...

597
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:00,292
No longer here.

598
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,592
Nothing is going to save you.

599
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,960
Not Brakebills.

600
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,930
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

601
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,666
Just do it.

602
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,668
Kill yourself.

603
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:19,571
Make it stop.

604
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,481
You know the way out.

605
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,919
King Quentin, no!

606
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,054
Oh, no, I wasn't. I was just...

607
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:37,789
- I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

608
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,492
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

609
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,761
I thought about it too.

610
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:46,364
Though I've never spoken
about it, of course.

611
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:48,133
Why not?

612
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,170
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

613
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,209
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

614
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:00,946
and turn them into, um,
maps, for example.

615
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,215
Jesus, Benedict.

616
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,016
Okay, we should talk about this.

617
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,018
If it please you, Sire, but first,

618
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,128
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

619
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,627
Yeah. I don't really trust
myself right now.

620
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:20,365
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

621
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,867
the crew would tie them to the mast.

622
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,435
[LAUGHS] Isn't that funny?

623
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,604
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

624
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:26,980
[LAUGHS]

625
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,043
- No... no, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

626
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,679
Okay, swear to me, no matter what I say,

627
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,750
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

628
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,254
Very well. I won't.

629
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:43,863
Thank you.

630
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,426
It worked.

631
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,856
Thank you.

Oh. I see the transfer worked.

634

It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

635
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,681
I hope you'll be careful.

636
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,517
I will be.

637
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:23,521
You know that fixing my glasses

638
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,757
won't fix me.

639
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,659
Yeah, but they make all of this

We're so far North.

00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:45,443
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

646
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,549
All that spritzing and bathing.

they're afraid

648
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:56,763

into a mushroom steam bath.

- That is not okay.
- No.

actually qualify as Big Bads.

assassinating the Queen.

need... we need... we need...

on a raft with that thing.

Have you tried distracting it?

For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

I really thought you could handle it.

No, no, you're right.

I wish we'd thought of tying
ourselves up.

That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

692

to pass it on to someone else.
