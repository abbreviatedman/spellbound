1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:03,007
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:04,278
We found a key, too.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,066
The ghost said it has the power

4
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:09,012
to reveal things that are hidden.
I'm a hidden thing.

5
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:10,074
I'm Hyman.

6
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:13,686
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

7
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:16,103
I spent months trying to push things.

8
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:20,025
I never got anywhere.
Until I tried being the thing.

9
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,992
Holy zerts! You did it!

10
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:25,696
The farmers are hesitant because
you're asking them to throw out food

11
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,599
- and replace it with, uh...
- Inedible mushrooms.

12
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,435
I got it. I just need it done.

13
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,338
On Earth we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first.

14
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:38,276
<i>Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.</i>

15
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:41,813
It is my duty and honor

16
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:43,881
to take the place of my late brother.

17
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,284
<i>- Why do you have magic?
- I don't know.</i>

18
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:47,785
I'd do anything to get it back.

19
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,121
If I could give it to you, I would.

20
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,097
What if you could?

21
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:01,666
Whoo. Sorry.

22
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,242
Okay.

23
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,307
Last I checked,
we're looking for a spell,

24
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,533
not starting an eBay store.

25
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:13,810
There's this old hedge story
I once heard

26
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,955
about some sort of electrical transfer.

27
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:19,306
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

28
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,548
People still talk about it.

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,439
Just look.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,767
So, you want us to reverse engineer

31
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:31,062
a hedge witch urban legend
using kids' toys?

32
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:33,565
I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

33
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:35,534
so unless you have a better idea.

34
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,691
Do you feel anything?

35
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,800
No.

36
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,236
Go again?

37
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:09,735
♪ Oh, as long as I know ♪

38
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:11,403
♪ How to love, I know I'll stay alive ♪

39
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,538
Why did that just turn on by itself?

40
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:14,873
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:16,241
♪ I've got all my love to give ♪

42
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,976
♪ And I'll survive ♪

43
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:20,545
Give me your hand.

44
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,414
Wait. Stop.

45
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,082
Do not do this.

46
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:25,762
Did you just use
that fish as a doorbell?

47
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:27,556
I've been trying to warn you
guys for, like, an hour.

48
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,087
"Being the fish button"
is the first thing

49
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:30,722
in this entire room that's worked.

50
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:33,091
- What are you trying to warn us about?
- This spell.

51
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,493
I've seen it in person.

52
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,094
Are you serious?

53
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah.

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,165
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

55
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,434
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

56
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:45,203
do the transfer, and by the end of it,

57
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,180
everyone was on fire.

58
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,008
Trust me. Fogg was right.

59
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,986
It's a bad idea.

60
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:56,281
Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

61
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,250
- Aw, f...
- Fuck me.

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,918
You have magic.

63
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:01,353
And you're just now telling me?

64
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,822
Don't take this the wrong way,

65
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:06,191
but you've been a little drunk.

66
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,460
- And unreliable.
- Yes.

67
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,931
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely... reliable.

68
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,336
Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

69
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:20,505
It wasn't Marina's spell. It's mine.

70
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,608
She stole it from my private collection.

71
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:26,111
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

72
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,480
on prohibited magic, you would know

73
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,116
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

74
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,185
It is incredibly delicate.

75
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:35,120
- We... we know that, but...
- But what?

76
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,688
But you want to rid yourself

77
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:39,324
of the one thing we all
so desperately want?

78
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:42,160
- If you understood what...
- You understand.

79
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,329
I'm a Magician with no magic.

80
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,832
A dean without a school.

81
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:49,467
Just a blind, unemployed

82
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:52,270
black man in America.

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,576
Which, shockingly, was actually
being kept 38% more tolerant

84
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,477
through a series of enchantments

85
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:01,677
which have now died.

86
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,915
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

87
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:05,958
- in a position to need to.
- Okay, you're really drunk.

88
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,060
So what?

89
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,256
What does it matter?

90
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,225
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

91
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,826
than to attempt this.

92
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,546
You want to blow yourselves up?
Is that it?

93
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:23,509
Um. Just give me one second.

94
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,173
Okay.

95
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,234
Uh, they'll hold for a day or two,

96
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,044
but then Alice can recharge them.

97
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,940
After we finish the transfer.

98
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,110
I know. Everything is fucked.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,579
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

100
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,273
Julia.

101
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:11,949
Yeah, well, it's not
<i>not</i> my fault, either so.

102
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,986
What you two utter idiots need,

103
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,755
if you don't want to die,

104
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,757
is the flesh of a magical creature

105
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,960
to act as a sort of semiconductor.

106
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,638
A potent energy-drainer. An incubus.

107
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,770
<i>If this is about the whole</i>

108
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,204
marriage not being consummated yet,

109
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:34,906
don't worry, it'll happen.

110
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,642
Oh, no, no, no.
You misunderstand me, my dear.

111
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:40,245
You see, I've heard a rumor
about your advisor,

112
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:42,914
the Pickwick?
Sighted in a certain corridor.

113
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:44,616
Taking scrapings from the wall.

114
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:46,484
He's just a compulsive redecorator.

115
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:49,154
You might be interested to
know that we both have been

116
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,756
plotting against our mutual friend.

117
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,261
No idea what you're talking about.

118
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,630
Margo.

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,165
You can trust me.

120
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,133
The misguided actions of my son

121
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:05,837
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

122
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,883
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

123
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:12,609
When the time is right,

124
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,021
we could use it to kill the Fairy Queen.

125
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,854
- Hi.
- Oh, hell no.

126
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:24,589
Move.

127
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,992
Hang your sheets out
the window afterwards, dear.

128
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,060
Guards! Guards!

129
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,196
Don't even think about closing it. No!

130
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:34,366
Guards!

131
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,477
Let me out!

132
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,016
<i>I don't give a shit
if you have to find someone</i>

133
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,584
to sell those shares short.

134
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,227
I need them today.

135
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,259
So the Incubus
is a hedge fund manager?

136
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,458
Plus 5%. And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

137
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:02,527
Just remember what Fogg said.

138
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:04,863
Be respectful, no matter what.

139
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,398
You got two minutes.

140
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,767
Henry Fogg said that you might be able

141
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,502
to help us power our spell.

142
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:14,339
Uh, we just... we need
to use your thing.

143
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,875
- My what?
- Uh, your... your thing.

144
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,511
Your... your business.

145
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,179
- Sorry?
- Uh.

146
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:24,816
Your little friend.
Uh, I mean... your big friend.

147
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,918
Well, I'm... I'm sure your friend

148
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:29,054
is perfectly proportioned to your body.

149
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:33,124
- I was just saying...
- Your penis.

150
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:36,861
Yep, we need to use your penis
to power our spell.

151
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,730
And we know that you need it too.

152
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,932
So that's why we'll build
the spell around it.

153
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,434
It'll be completely painless

154
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:44,010
and should only take a couple minutes.

155
00:07:56,658 --> 00:07:58,983
I can't believe that actually worked!

156
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:00,985
Wha... what actually worked?

157
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,822
I planted this joke on Fogg
25 years ago.

158
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,157
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

159
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,326
Wait, so you...
you don't have a magic...

160
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,564
Of course not.

161
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:11,096
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

162
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,897
I mean you're an incubus.

163
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:15,400
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

164
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,435
Gods no.

165
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,803
I don't even like sex.

166
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:23,174
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

167
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:24,476
May I?

168
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,551
Oh, and you.

169
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,020
You got a lot of it, I can tell.

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,960
Delish.

171
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,863
You give me
a few more hits of this,

172
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,297
and I'll give you something

173
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,574
that'll actually power your spell.

174
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:58,143
- Is that your tail?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:58,153 --> 00:08:59,886
Yeah, I grow a new one every spring.

176
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,549
Welcome back.

177
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,318
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

178
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:10,788
You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

179
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:13,958
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

180
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:17,136
and unforeseen seafaring... confusion.

181
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,412
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

182
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:23,001
- of course...
- No, you won't.

183
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,670
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,507
The Stone Queen has locked
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

185
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,709
Wait. What? Why?

186
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:35,313
She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

187
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:38,249
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

188
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,018
just as much as the Floaters do.

189
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,853
Listen, pro tip.

190
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,988
Let Margo out of there immediately.

191
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,191
You know her. Force isn't going to work.

192
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,527
True. Force may not work.

193
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:52,530
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

194
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,998
I am not going to coerce Margo

195
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,934
into having sex with a 15-year-old.

196
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,495
Have you never heard of statutory rape?

197
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:00,772
- Fomar isn't a statue.
- That is not what...

198
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,240
Forget it.

199
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,943
You will solve this problem for me.

200
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,452
And if I refuse?

201
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:13,618
I've been searching for a new keepsake.

202
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:15,553
Several bits will do.

203
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:18,256
Fine, but I have a feeling Queen Margo

204
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,758
is going to be a little bit difficult.

205
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:23,561
I know!

206
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,663
You hate me for killing Micah.

207
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:27,532
Jesus Christ.

208
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,800
It's just in our culture,

209
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,370
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

210
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,239
Most of us wind up

211
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,141
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

212
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,244
Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

213
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,179
No.

214
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:42,580
So, do you want to take a break?

215
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,182
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

216
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:46,251
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

217
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,819
into a decorative, whimsical planter?

218
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,421
How are we supposed to become one flesh

219
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,423
if you won't let me touch you?

220
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,292
- We're not.
- But you're my wife.

221
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:55,893
Oh, please.

222
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,729
You don't need a wife.

223
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,031
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

224
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,434
What's a sex class? Who... who's Ed?

225
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:05,069
It's something they make you
do on Earth.

226
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,412
It makes you never wanna.

227
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,216
How about I show you?

228
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,483
Vaginas.

229
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:21,286
The leading cause of death in men.

230
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:23,421
They spread disease.

231
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,623
They explode during childbirth.

232
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:30,662
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

233
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:33,498
In fact, mine's doing it right now.

234
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:36,375
Well, that's okay. I like blood.

235
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,614
But do you like teeth?

236
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:46,811
Sorry I'm late.

237
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,179
You okay?

238
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,548
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

239
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:52,650
This uniform is, like, really sweaty.

240
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,786
Yeah, I know, but it beats

241
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,570
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

242
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:59,190
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

243
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,559
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

244
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,462
Uh, okay, so I'm pretty sure that

245
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,164
the fourth key is somewhere

246
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,132
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

247
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:10,468
Um, it's an uncharted region of Fillory

248
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:14,138
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

249
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:17,975
Um, but, you know, we get to go

250
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:22,280
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

251
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,383
Uh, yeah. I wish I could.

252
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,252
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

253
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:30,688
- And I can't leave Margo.
- Right, of course.

254
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:32,824
- Sorry.
- No.

255
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,226
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

256
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,902
Who wouldn't?

257
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,099
Uh, think about it.
You can take Benedict.

258
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:43,735
Go be life-partners with
someone else for a little bit.

259
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:47,038
But you'll be able to do the...
thing on the prow of a ship

260
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,706
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

261
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,784
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

262
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,367
Whoo!

263
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,176
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

264
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,387
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

265
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:47,064
Being on a mission is a hell
of an antidepressant.

266
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:48,399
You notice that, Benedict?

267
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,142
Well, now that you mention it.

268
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,805
Whoa.

269
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:55,514
We're entering The Abyss, Sire.

270
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:01,520
It'll be darkness from here on.

271
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,559
Thank you.

272
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,164
So how long until we can keep going?

273
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,667
As soon as we find safe
passage, your Majesty.

274
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:24,836
Is someone out there?

275
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,445
Help!

276
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,450
Is someone out there? Help!

277
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,524
God, I think there's someone
out there on a raft.

278
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,958
You okay?

279
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:48,259
Wow, wow, wow.

280
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,595
You just saved the shit out of me.

281
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,363
Poppy Kline.

282
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,399
Draconologist, postgraduate
fellow, and field researcher

283
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,468
at your service.

284
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,813
Holy shit. You're from Brakebills?

285
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,148
Yeah.

286
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:11,850
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

287
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:12,480
Yeah.

288
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,816
I've been stuck in
The Abyss way too long.

289
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,283
How did you end up out here anyway?

290
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:17,924
Oh, I came with some other students.

291
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,621
Oh. Hey, sorry. I can, um... uh.

292
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:23,057
Spring Break, Class of 2016?

293
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,459
Didn't turn out so well for us,

294
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,527
but that is a whole nother story.

295
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,251
Wait, sorry.

296
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:29,482
Do you know, um...

297
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,361
If the next two words out
of your mouth are "Josh"

298
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,220
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

299
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,036
No way. He's still alive?

300
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:37,305
I mean, as far as I know.

301
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,906
Oh, that's amazing.

302
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,808
So how does a Brakebills student

303
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:43,311
wind up alone on a raft?

304
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:46,214
Get a girl a drink.
I'll tell you the whole story.

305
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,490
All right.

306
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,997
Your Majesty.

307
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,266
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

308
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,968
Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

309
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:08,336
High Queen Margo let him go

310
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:09,771
as he was innocent of all charges.

311
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:13,207
Oh, right. Yeah.

312
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:14,583
Sorry about that.

313
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,085
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

314
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,921
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

315
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,223
An hour's ride North, there is a forest

316
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,392
with naturally-occurring aphrodisiacs

317
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:34,128
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

318
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,364
Fine.

319
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:38,065
- But if you fail...
- I know, I know.

320
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,435
New keepsakes. Fingers, ears.

321
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:42,537
Try your spleen.

322
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,447
- Okay.
- Go.

323
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,576
Fieldwork was my thing at
Brakebills, and well, dragons.

324
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,044
Love them.

325
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:52,113
Wait, so what happened to your ship?

326
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:53,714
Oh, wrecked.

327
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,283
Off the coast of the Truthwaters.

328
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:58,085
I spent two years on that little Picket.

329
00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:01,756
And, bam.
Over in an instant.

330
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,991
That was three weeks ago.

331
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:07,829
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

332
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,731
Yeah, it was rough.

333
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:11,866
Especially without magic.

334
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,501
Do you know anything about why the hell

335
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,870
- it just went out?
- I mean, um...

336
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,306
I just hope someone's fixing it.

337
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:21,576
That someone is, um, sort of me.

338
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:26,681
Um, I'm on a... a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

339
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,182
Right, so there's seven of them.

340
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:31,419
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Golden keys?

341
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,828
Like...

342
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,626
- Holy shit. How did you...
- Short version?

343
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:40,261
Stole it.

344
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:42,530
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

345
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,999
just, like, covered in treasure.

346
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,802
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

347
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,653
Spontaneous orgasm.

348
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,471
I mean, places like this are so rare.

349
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,139
There are only two species of dragon

350
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,824
that even build treasure-nests.

351
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,042
Anyway, this was in one of them

352
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,636
with a bunch of cool stuff.

353
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,463
But the thing that got me was

354
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,433
I could feel something coming off it.

355
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:04,557
- Yeah.
- Even now.

356
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,917
It's somehow not dead, right?

357
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,141
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

358
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,143
so I just took it.

359
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,580
Just like that?

360
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,013
I'm a person of questionable ethics.

361
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:18,691
Here.

362
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:22,927
It's yours, from one quester to another.

363
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:26,855
- Wow. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,714
So do you know what it does?
I mean, each one

365
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,694
sort of has a unique thing.

366
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:32,308
I don't know.

367
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:35,353
- Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

368
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:39,103
Uh, here's to that.

369
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,677
- You wanna? Yeah.
- Oh.

370
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,560
Okay. Well, here goes nothing.

371
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:04,462
Ugh, man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

372
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:06,297
You're gonna kill yourselves!

373
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,800
- Oh, my God. I can't...
- Golly Moses.

374
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,736
You're right. They're
gonna kill themselves.

375
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:14,171
Don't you have some shower to go haunt?

376
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:16,340
Oh, no one's showering right now.

377
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,476
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

378
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,645
Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

379
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:23,214
Ah, just a bit zozzled, I think.

380
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:26,417
He was quite naked.

381
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:29,295
Remarkably... well-preserved.

382
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:33,324
Guess it's possible to age gracefully.

383
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,582
Oh, my God.

384
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:36,574
Fuck, man. I can't watch this.

385
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:39,664
See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

386
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:41,392
You act like you don't care,

387
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:44,267
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

388
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:46,370
Yeah, then... then why
is everyone acting

389
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,286
like I'm not a part of it anymore?

390
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,333
Maybe it's time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

391
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:54,512
- You mean, leave?
- Why not?

392
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,347
Go... go find a story to watch

393
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:58,149
that doesn't make you so depressed.

394
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,218
Oh, I think they did it.

395
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:09,860
I'm having a good time.

396
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,442
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close...

397
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,685
Rise and shine, princess.

398
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:46,880
Who?

399
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,949
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

400
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,646
to black out after, what, five drinks?

401
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,466
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

402
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:53,625
I don't...

403
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:57,191
Okay. Uh...

404
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,786
Um...

405
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,563
Seriously.

406
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,307
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

407
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:11,613
Sorry, um, can you... are
you... are you seeing this?

408
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:15,109
Nobody cares, dude.

409
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,945
They all have actual jobs, unlike you.

410
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:19,746
Right, okay.

411
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:21,289
No problem.

412
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,289
- What the fuck did you do?
- Okay, I can explain.

413
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:31,291
- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

414
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:33,494
- It's all right.
- There's another me.

415
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,796
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

416
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:37,498
Nothing about this is all right.

417
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:39,515
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

418
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:41,671
- The key does have a power.
- No shit.

419
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:43,603
It takes the darkest parts of you

420
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:46,773
and makes a... kind of...
well, you met it.

421
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:50,144
It's kind of like a depression monster?

422
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:53,881
Looks like you, talks like you.

423
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:57,084
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

424
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:59,119
- Unless...
- Unless?

425
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:00,220
Unless it gets in your head

426
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,822
and convinces you to hurt yourself.

427
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,427
- Well...
- But you'll be fine.

428
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,591
It only affects the last person
who touched the key.

429
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:07,661
So just pass it along to someone else.

430
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:10,797
- That's what we did.
- Who's we?

431
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,132
My former shipmates.

432
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:13,228
After I stole the key,

433
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,701
we passed it from person to person

434
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,938
until we, you know, ran out of options.

435
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:20,207
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

436
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,212
Um. Hit an iceberg?

437
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:25,011
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

438
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:27,314
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

439
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:28,982
You have to be, like, a badass about it,

440
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,884
and what can I say?

441
00:22:30,894 --> 00:22:32,686
- They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

442
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:35,856
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

443
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:38,225
Eh. Maybe, like, half?

444
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:40,327
This key made half of your shipmates

445
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:42,663
kill themselves, and you gave it to me?

446
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,531
Yeah. But don't worry.

447
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,568
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

448
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,736
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

449
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:52,839
Mmmm, no. No, no.

450
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,075
I'm not. This is like...

451
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:56,510
It's like we're on a boat, okay?

452
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,212
This is not how I usually am.

453
00:22:58,222 --> 00:23:00,013
You're usually
a wet blanket, self-pitying,

454
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:01,048
party pooping dickwad.

455
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:03,317
Shut up!

456
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,519
You better pass that along fast.

457
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:08,121
What? No! Not if there is a 50%

458
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:09,623
chance of it killing the next person.

459
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:14,061
Okay.

460
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,697
Right, yep. I'll just hold on to it.

461
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:18,765
Until we get back to Whitespire.

462
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:20,801
- I can do that.
- Your choice.

463
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:22,502
I mean, we're stuck in The Abyss

464
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:23,637
till we found our way out.

465
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,506
It could be days. It could be weeks.

466
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:28,542
Oh, but hey. Don't stress.

467
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:31,211
- You might be fine.
- You won't be.

468
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:33,080
You know what?

469
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,083
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

470
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,518
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

471
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,053
that I've got a black belt.

472
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:41,496
So come at me.

473
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:47,492
The problem is your hair.

474
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,270
I know you're just trying
to hide your face,

475
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,298
but it really only makes it worse.

476
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:52,899
Seriously, have you ever noticed

477
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,534
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

478
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:56,103
If feet had frown lines?

479
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:58,205
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

480
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:01,108
which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

481
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:03,777
Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

482
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:06,713
And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

483
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,415
a senile frowny foot-face.

484
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:10,725
Jesus. Fuck.

485
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:15,864
This is pointless. You can't run me off.

486
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,134
You can't eat me off.

487
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,337
You can't drink me off.

488
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:26,266
You can't jerk me off.

489
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:27,634
God, you're so vulgar.

490
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:30,437
We had a thing going,
and you... you made it

491
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:32,272
unnecessarily gross.

492
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:35,976
You sick of the shallow, petty stuff?

493
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:38,345
I get it.

494
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:40,213
The thing is, I start on the outside,

495
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,516
and I work my way into the core.

496
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:46,119
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

497
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:47,521
when you could have helped her,

498
00:24:47,531 --> 00:24:50,388
that is what set her on that path.

499
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,758
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

500
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,321
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

501
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:58,414
You ruined her.

502
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:01,313
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

503
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:03,880
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

504
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:08,008
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

505
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,578
Just stop!

506
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:12,313
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

507
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,524
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

508
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:16,782
But you are never gonna feel okay.

509
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,553
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

510
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:21,029
Quentin.

511
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:24,311
I am your head.

512
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,402
You know I'm right because I am you.

513
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:37,137
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

514
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:39,406
Fomar.

515
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,982
Bottoms up.

516
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,380
Uh, in my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

517
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,583
- Drink the wine, Margo.
- I don't wanna drink the wine.

518
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,734
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

519
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,544
You'll feel better if you just

520
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,664
drink the wine, Margo.

521
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,804
So, um...

522
00:26:10,814 --> 00:26:13,243
Do we have sex in the carriage?

523
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:16,075
Or do we have sex outside?

524
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:20,213
- Or do...
- I'm not having sex with you.

525
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:23,683
You psychotic fetus.

526
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:25,260
Ever.

527
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,629
Either I just killed him with my rage

528
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:37,063
or you drugged his wine.

529
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,899
And to think...

530
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,708
- You doubted me.
- To think.

531
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:46,773
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

532
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:49,009
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

533
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:51,545
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

534
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:53,219
than sleeping beauty over here.

535
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,615
The fairies are up to something
in the Northern Orchards.

536
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,584
They evacuated the villagers weeks ago

537
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,753
and haven't let another human in since.

538
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:03,123
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

539
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,192
and he saw some crazy shit.

540
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:07,727
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

541
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:10,664
mutant plant life, Chernobyl-level shit.

542
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:13,667
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

543
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:17,237
Great, well, now I can't be mad at you.

544
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,680
Thanks.

545
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,555
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

546
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,843
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

547
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:25,512
- we could just...
- Be us again?

548
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:27,514
Who are we now, El?

549
00:27:27,524 --> 00:27:28,949
We used to be glamorous,

550
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:31,685
amazing mega-bitches.

551
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:33,253
And now?

552
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:37,624
We have depth and character.

553
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:40,660
Let's decide... we'll find us again

554
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,963
once we're done saving Fillory.

555
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,272
Okay?

556
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:48,034
Duty calls.

557
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:49,944
Let's go see about these orchards.

558
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:58,253
Which are...

559
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,092
No longer here.

560
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,892
Nothing is going to save you.

561
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:14,260
Not Brakebills.

562
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,230
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

563
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,966
Just do it.

564
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:21,968
Kill yourself.

565
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:24,871
Make it stop.

566
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:26,781
You know the way out.

567
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,219
King Quentin, no!

568
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:41,354
Oh, no, I wasn't. I was just...

569
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:43,089
- I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

570
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:45,792
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

571
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:48,061
I thought about it too.

572
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:51,664
Though I've never spoken
about it, of course.

573
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:53,433
Why not?

574
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:57,470
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

575
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,509
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

576
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,246
and turn them into, um,
maps, for example.

577
00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:08,515
Jesus, Benedict.

578
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:10,316
Okay, we should talk about this.

579
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:12,318
If it please you, Sire, but first,

580
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:14,428
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

581
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,927
Yeah. I don't really trust
myself right now.

582
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:25,665
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

583
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,167
the crew would tie them to the mast.

584
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,735
Isn't that funny?

585
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:30,904
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

586
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,343
- No... no, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

587
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:39,979
Okay, swear to me, no matter what I say,

588
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:44,050
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

589
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,554
Very well. I won't.

590
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:49,163
Thank you.

591
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,726
It worked.

592
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:23,156
Thank you.

593
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:16,409
Oh. I see the transfer worked.

594
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,612
It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

595
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:21,981
I hope you'll be careful.

596
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:24,817
I will be.

597
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:28,821
You know that fixing my glasses

598
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:31,057
won't fix me.

599
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,959
Yeah, but they make all of this

600
00:31:32,969 --> 00:31:35,303
one speck less shitty.

601
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:44,578
It smells like the fairy realm.

602
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:47,907
We're so far North.

603
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,743
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

604
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:53,279
Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

605
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,849
All that spritzing and bathing.

606
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:59,185
You know, it's... it's like
they're afraid

607
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:02,063
to dry out in Fillory or something.

608
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:06,233
Oh, my God.

609
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:10,630
The fuckers are terraforming.

610
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,266
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

611
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:15,101
- That is not okay.
- No.

612
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:16,577
Definitely not.

613
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:21,307
That mushroom just moved.

614
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,517
- Really?
- Should I pluck it?

615
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:27,447
I'm... I'm gonna do it.

616
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:29,123
Mm. Margo, don't.

617
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:44,572
It's a fairy embryo.

618
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:48,001
- Really?
- These are eggs, El.

619
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:49,402
I mean, really?

620
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:51,237
The fairies aren't just terraforming.

621
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:53,473
They're growing an army.

622
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:54,815
Oh, fuck.

623
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,691
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

624
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,559
I mean, think about all the crazy shit

625
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:03,894
they've kept us busy with.

626
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:07,898
Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

627
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:10,834
This is all just
a thin frosting of whimsy

628
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:14,004
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

629
00:33:14,014 --> 00:33:17,374
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

630
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:19,910
We need a plan bigger than just
assassinating the Queen.

631
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,580
We need... we need... we
need... we need... we need...

632
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,558
We need... Margo?

633
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,688
Margo?

634
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:32,523
Kidnapping. Hostages. Leverage.

635
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:35,225
- Don't ask questions, go! Go!
- What the fuck?

636
00:33:35,235 --> 00:33:37,402
Go, go!

637
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:49,340
It's a bitch, right?

638
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,375
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

639
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:52,710
Have you tried distracting it?

640
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,946
For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

641
00:33:55,956 --> 00:33:57,715
Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

642
00:33:57,725 --> 00:33:59,450
Please, fuck off.

643
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,885
Look, I'm sorry I passed you the key.

644
00:34:01,895 --> 00:34:03,387
I really thought you could handle it.

645
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:05,222
This is me handling it.

646
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:08,225
No, no, you're right.

647
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:10,527
I wish we'd thought of tying
ourselves up.

648
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:12,896
That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

649
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:14,865
That killed three of us off quick.

650
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,600
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

651
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,702
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

652
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:20,545
Others, it takes time to wear down.

653
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:26,777
You want me to take the key for a while?
Give you some relief?

654
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:29,146
No.

655
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,715
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

656
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:34,051
And I need it.

657
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:36,120
- For the quest.
- Fine.

658
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,322
Be a suffer-martyr.

659
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:40,057
Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

660
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,126
They help sometimes, too.

661
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:45,396
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

662
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:46,897
Keyholes, like...

663
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:50,501
Like in the walls or clocks.

664
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:52,669
Don't ask me how it works.

665
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,005
So... so where do the keyholes go?

666
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:58,776
To Earth or the Neitherlands
or wherever.

667
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,986
Wait, wait. Are you serious?

668
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,828
Stop it. What are you doing?

669
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,567
I've been stuck here in
Fillory this whole time

670
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:10,888
when I could have gone home?

671
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:13,490
Hey. No, Poppy, stop it.

672
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,093
Poppy, no. Stop.

673
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,529
Poppy!

674
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:20,731
I told you
you should've killed yourself.

675
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,377
Okay.

676
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,102
Okay, we just have one
outstanding problem.

677
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,843
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

678
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:35,053
Don't worry. I got this.

679
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:44,154
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

680
00:35:44,164 --> 00:35:47,391
- They've got three eyes?
- No, baby.

681
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:49,234
They've got fangs.

682
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:58,669
Oh! Oh, something bit my manhood.

683
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,737
Congratulations, son. You just had sex.

684
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:02,639
The first time's always painful.

685
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:04,908
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

686
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:08,545
But, hey, you were amazing.

687
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:10,747
What?

688
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,457
I like to watch.

689
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:16,386
Wanna go again?

690
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,624
Benedict!

691
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,096
Benedict, help!

692
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:27,844
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my God, Benedict.

693
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,118
- Okay, untie me.
- Sire, you said not to untie you.

694
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:32,603
No. No, no, no, no, no. Please, come on.
Okay, look.

695
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:34,171
I'm not trying to kill myself.

696
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:36,073
Poppy took the key, and she is trying

697
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,608
to use it to get back to Earth.

698
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,476
Just... okay, go find her yourself.

699
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:42,079
Just whatever you do, do not
let her leave with that key.

700
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:43,321
Yes, Your Majesty.

701
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,525
God.

702
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:51,555
No! Stop!

703
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:05,844
- Hey, did you get it?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

704
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:09,907
I'm a terrible failure.

705
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,150
Okay. It's okay.

706
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,020
We'll get the key back somehow.

707
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:24,462
Benedict.

708
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:30,160
Hey, hey. Benedict.

709
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,062
Whoa, Benedict, no. Hey, listen.

710
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:35,766
Whatever it's telling you
to do, do not do it.

711
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:38,135
I'm sorry.

712
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:39,477
Benedict, no!

713
00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:53,091
Mm. Yummy.

719
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,780
Penny, what's wrong?

720
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,780
- Just saying goodbye.
- What?

721
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,116
Goodbye? Where are you going?

722
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,519
Just away.

723
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,622
Away... wait.

724
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,176
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um. I don't understand.

725
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,971
Is this because
of what happened with Kady?

726
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,340
- No.
- Okay.

727
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,708
Is it because we did the transfer?

728
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,860
No. Look, I gotta go.

729
00:38:39,871 --> 00:38:41,612
Wait, will you just
talk to me for a second?

730
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:44,147
You know what,
we barely know each other.

731
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:47,017
Don't suddenly act like
you care just 'cause I'm going.

732
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:48,221
I'm not acting.

733
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:51,299
I do care. I don't want to see you go.
I don't want to see you give up.

734
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,636
- Give up?
- Yeah.

735
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:57,841
You're the one who had magic,
and you gave it away.

736
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,712
What's your plan? Go back to law school?

737
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:02,598
Live off your trust fund?

738
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:05,202
Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

739
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:07,532
and try to remember what life was like

740
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,902
without a god or a quest.

741
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,775
Or some dead asshole bothering me.

742
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:13,410
And, I don't know, frankly beyond that,

743
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,811
it's none of your business.

744
00:39:14,821 --> 00:39:17,581
'Cause you have nothing beyond that.

745
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:25,830
Penny wants to say goodbye.

746
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:31,795
- You're leaving?
- I can't do this anymore.

747
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:35,573
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

748
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,773
Why don't I just make you a new body?

749
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,516
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

750
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,461
A-plus job

751
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:07,230
getting rid of me, gorgeous.

752
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,145
Is this just a dream?

753
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,116
That time you fell out
of a tree when you were 12.

754
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:16,840
The bone in your arm healed
in six little weeks.

755
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,351
How come your fear of heights never did?

756
00:40:24,624 --> 00:40:26,358
I'm not the bone.

757
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,728
I'm the terror.

758
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:34,291
I do love how you keep trying.

759
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:40,831
And trying. And trying.

760
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,006
I have not been punched

761
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:50,340
that hard since Burning Man.

762
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,351
Where is he? Where did he go?

763
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,621
Why does it smell like barbeque?

764
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:03,011
Benedict is dead,
and best-case-scenario,

765
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,549
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

766
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,623
- Um, Quentin.
- Don't talk to me.

767
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,658
- Please, I mean it.
- Okay.

768
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:10,425
Just... Just one thing

769
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:12,329
and I swear I will never
talk to you again.

770
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,463
What?

771
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,532
Dragons don't shit.

772
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,501
Okay, great, fun fact. Thanks.

773
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,236
No one knows exactly how it works,

774
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:21,905
but what they ingest goes elsewhere.

775
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:23,540
They're gatekeepers, you know?

776
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,308
They don't just make portals.

777
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,310
They are portals.

778
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,714
So, actual best-case-scenario...

779
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:33,483
The key went to the Underworld.

780
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,994
- Mm.
- Oh, my God.

781
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,561
If you're here, I'm practicing

782
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,963
an Osseus Confervium. Bone-knitting.

783
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:48,765
First step to building a new body.

784
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:53,537
I know you can't see me, but I'm here.

785
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,113
Thanks for giving a shit about me.

786
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,812
Alice?

787
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,348
Alice, you okay? Alice?

788
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,251
God, Alice. Alice!

789
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:11,455
God, this is... where's...

790
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:13,223
Alice!

791
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,564
Okay, okay, God. Come on.

792
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:23,975
