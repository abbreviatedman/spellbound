1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,475
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,244
We found a key, too.

3
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,345
The ghost said it has the power

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,614
to reveal things that are hidden.
I'm a hidden thing.

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,083
I'm Hyman.

6
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:18,319
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,688
I spent months trying to push things.

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,592
I never got anywhere.
Until I tried being the thing.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,427
Holy zerts! You did it!

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,231
The farmers are hesitant because
you're asking them to throw out food

11
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,167
- and replace it with, uh...
- Inedible mushrooms.

12
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,703
I got it. I just need it done.

13
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,639
On Earth we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first.

14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,576
<i>Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.</i>

15
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,314
It is my duty and honor

16
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,349
to take the place of my late brother.

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,584
<i>- Why do you have magic?
- I don't know.</i>

18
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,286
I'd do anything to get it back.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,488
If I could give it to you, I would.

20
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:56,464
What if you could?

21
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,200
Whoo. Sorry.

22
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,607
Last I checked,
we're looking for a spell,

23
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,309
not starting an eBay store.

24
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,446
There's this old hedge story
I once heard

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,548
about some sort of electrical transfer

26
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,152
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

27
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,587
People still talk about it.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,256
Just look.

29
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,361
So, you want us to reverse engineer

30
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,596
a hedge witch urban legend
using kids' toys?

31
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,266
I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

32
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,234
so unless you have a better idea.

33
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,358
Do you feel anything?

34
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,426
No.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,728
Go again?

36
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,402
♪ Oh, as long as I know ♪

37
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,170
♪ How to love, I know I'll stay alive ♪

38
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:18,272
Why did that just turn on by itself?

39
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,473
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,708
♪ I've got all my love to give ♪

41
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,543
♪ And I'll survive ♪

42
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,279
Give me your hand.

43
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,181
Wait. Stop.

44
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,616
Do not do this.

45
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,518
Did you just use
that fish as a doorbell?

46
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,253
I've been trying to warn you
guys for, like, an hour.

47
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,621
"Being the fish button"
is the first thing

48
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,389
in this entire room that's worked.

49
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,625
- What are you trying to warn us about?
- This spell.

50
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,260
I've seen it in person.

51
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,861
Are you serious?

52
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,663
Yeah.

53
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,698
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

54
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,201
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

55
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,703
do the transfer, and by the end of it,

56
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,705
everyone was on fire.

57
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,575
Trust me. Fogg was right.

58
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,577
It's a bad idea.

59
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,748
Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

60
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,750
- Aw, f...
- Fuck me.

61
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,552
You have magic.

62
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,819
And you're just now telling me?

63
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,456
Don't take this the wrong way,

64
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,724
but you've been a little drunk.

65
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,227
- And unreliable.
- Yes.

66
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:17,531
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely... reliable.

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,803
Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

68
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,273
It wasn't Marina's spell. It's mine.

69
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,342
She stole it from my private collection.

70
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,644
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

71
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,247
on prohibited magic, you would know

72
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,649
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

73
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,718
It is incredibly delicate.

74
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,653
- We... we know that, but...
- But what?

75
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,389
But you want to rid yourself

76
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,791
of the one thing we all
so desperately want?

77
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,694
- If you understood what...
- You understand.

78
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,796
I'm a Magician with no magic.

79
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,499
A dean without a school.

80
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,901
Just a blind, unemployed

81
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,770
black man in America.

82
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:02,343
Which, shockingly, was actually
being kept 38% more tolerant

83
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,911
through a series of enchantments

84
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,480
which have now died.

85
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,616
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

86
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,551
- in a position to need to.
- Okay, you're really drunk.

87
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,652
So what?

88
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,789
What does it matter?

89
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,758
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,493
than to attempt this.

91
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,295
You want to blow yourselves up?
Is that it?

92
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,302
Um. Just give me one second.

93
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,768
Uh, they'll hold for a day or two,

94
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,670
but then Alice can recharge them.

95
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,574
After we finish the transfer.

96
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,710
I know. Everything is fucked.

97
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,346
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

98
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,881
Julia.

99
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,584
Yeah, well, it's not
<i>not</i> my fault, either so.

100
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,620
What you two utter idiots need,

101
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,455
if you don't want to die,

102
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,457
is the flesh of a magical creature

103
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,594
to act as a sort of semiconductor.

104
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:30,398
A potent energy-drainer. An incubus.

105
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,470
<i>If this is about the whole</i>

106
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,771
marriage not being consummated yet,

107
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,573
don't worry, it'll happen.

108
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,410
Oh, no, no, no.
You misunderstand me, my dear.

109
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,778
You see, I've heard a rumor
about your advisor,

110
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,581
the Pickwick?
Sighted in a certain corridor.

111
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,383
Taking scrapings from the wall.

112
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,951
He's just a compulsive redecorator.

113
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,754
You might be interested to
know that we both have been

114
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,490
plotting against our mutual friend.

115
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,794
No idea what you're talking about.

116
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,397
Margo.

117
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:04,765
You can trust me.

118
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,734
The misguided actions of my son

119
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,538
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

120
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,575
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

121
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,044
When the time is right,

122
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,680
we could use it to kill the Fairy Queen.

123
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,555
- Hi.
- Oh, hell no.

124
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,022
Move.

125
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,659
Hang your sheets out
the window afterwards, dear.

126
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,694
Guards! Guards!

127
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,796
Don't even think about closing it. No!

128
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,899
Guards!

129
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,969
Let me out!

<i>I don't give a shit

132
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,050
to sell those shares short.

133
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,819
I need them today.

134
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,589
So the Incubus
is a hedge fund manager?

135
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,956
- Mm-hmm.
- Plus 5%.

136
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,958
And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

137
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,994
Just remember what Fogg said.

138
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,563
Be respectful, no matter what.

139
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,931
You got two minutes.

140
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,534
Henry Fogg said that you might be able

141
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,968
to help us power our spell.

142
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,872
Uh, we just... we need
to use your thing.

143
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,575
- My what?
- Uh, your... your thing.

144
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,977
Your... your business.

145
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:25,946
- Sorry?
- Uh.

146
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,550
Your little friend.
Uh, I mean... your big friend.

147
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,619
Well, I'm... I'm sure your friend

148
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,721
is perfectly proportioned to your body.

149
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:37,758
- I was just saying...
- Your penis.

150
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,595
Yep, we need to use your penis
to power our spell.

151
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,497
And we know that you need it too.

152
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,633
So that's why we'll build
the spell around it.

153
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,967
It'll be completely painless

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,702
and should only take a couple minutes.

155
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,684
I can't believe that actually worked!

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,752
Wha... what actually worked?

157
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,589
I planted this joke on Fogg
25 years ago.

158
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,824
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

159
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,893
Wait, so you...
you don't have a magic...

160
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,161
Of course not.

161
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,763
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

162
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,631
I mean you're an incubus.

163
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,933
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

164
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,969
Gods no.

165
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,771
I don't even like sex.

166
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,808
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

167
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,009
May I?

168
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:38,085
Oh, and you.

169
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,721
You got a lot of it, I can tell.

170
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,660
Delish.

171
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,630
You give me
a few more hits of this,

172
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,898
and I'll give you something

173
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,100
that'll actually power your spell.

174
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,810
- Is that your tail?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,645
Yeah, I grow a new one every spring.

176
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,082
Welcome back.

177
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,919
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

178
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,222
You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

179
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,692
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

180
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,829
and unforeseen seafaring... confusion.

181
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,899
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

182
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,701
- of course...
- No, you won't.

183
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,170
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

184
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,041
The Stone Queen has locked
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

185
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,176
Wait. What? Why?

186
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,047
She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,883
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

188
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,718
just as much as the Floaters do.

189
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,620
Listen, pro tip.

190
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,722
Let Margo out of there immediately.

191
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,858
You know her. Force isn't going to work.

192
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,061
True. Force may not work.

193
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,064
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

194
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,732
I am not going to coerce Margo

195
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,701
into having sex with a 15-year-old.

196
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,102
Have you never heard of statutory rape?

197
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,238
- Fomar isn't a statue.
- That is not what...

198
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,874
Forget it.

199
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,710
You will solve this problem for me.

200
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,219
And if I refuse?

201
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:18,151
I've been searching for a new keepsake.

202
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,087
Several bits will do.

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,890
Fine, but I have a feeling Queen Margo

204
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,225
is going to be a little bit difficult.

205
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,261
I know!

206
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,163
You hate me for killing Micah.

207
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,065
Jesus Christ.

208
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,801
It's just in our culture,

209
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,970
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

210
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,906
Most of us wind up

211
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,842
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

212
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,911
Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

213
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,879
No.

214
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,114
So, do you want to take a break?

215
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,016
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

216
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,918
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

217
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,285
into a decorative, whimsical planter?

218
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,022
How are we supposed to become one flesh

219
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,024
if you won't let me touch you?

220
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,926
- We're not.
- But you're my wife.

221
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,694
Oh, please.

222
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,195
You don't need a wife.

223
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,798
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

224
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:08,035
What's a sex class? Who... who's Ed?

225
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,803
It's something they make you
do on Earth.

226
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,038
It makes you never wanna.

227
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,908
How about I show you?

228
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,083
Vaginas.

229
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,953
The leading cause of death in men.

230
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,021
They spread disease.

231
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,157
They explode during childbirth.

232
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:35,195
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

233
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,098
In fact, mine's doing it right now.

234
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,001
Well, that's okay. I like blood.

235
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,381
But do you like teeth?

236
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,278
Sorry I'm late.

237
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,113
You okay?

238
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,115
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

239
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,184
This uniform is, like, really sweaty.

240
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,252
Yeah, I know, but it beats

241
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,188
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

242
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,891
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

243
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,126
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

244
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,062
Uh, okay, so I'm pretty sure that

245
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,864
the fourth key is somewhere

246
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,866
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

247
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,135
Um, it's an uncharted region of Fillory

248
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,872
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

249
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,409
Um, but, you know, we get to go

250
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:26,947
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

251
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,017
Uh, yeah. I wish I could.

252
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,953
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

253
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,255
- And I can't leave Margo.
- Right, of course.

254
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,290
- Sorry.
- No.

255
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,927
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

256
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,669
Who wouldn't?

257
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,866
Uh, think about it.
You can take Benedict.

258
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,268
Go be life-partners with
someone else for a little bit.

259
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,805
But you'll be able to do the...
thing on the prow of a ship

260
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,240
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

261
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,309
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

262
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,935
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

263
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

264
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,498
Being on a mission is a hell
of an antidepressant.

265
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,066
You notice that, Benedict?

266
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,902
Well, now that you mention it.

267
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,140
We're entering The Abyss, Sire.

268
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,146
It'll be darkness from here on.

269
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,184
Thank you.

270
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,932
So how long until we can keep going?

271
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,267
As soon as we find safe
passage, your Majesty.

272
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,603
Is someone out there?

273
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,138
Help!

274
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,143
Is someone out there? Help!

275
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,183
God, I think there's someone
out there on a raft.

276
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:51,725
You okay?

277
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,195
You just saved the shit out of me.

278
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,330
Poppy Kline.

279
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,100
Draconologist, postgraduate
fellow, and field researcher

280
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,135
at your service.

281
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,372
Holy shit. You're from Brakebills?

282
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,620
Yeah.

283
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,984
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

284
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:16,915
Yeah.

285
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,086
Shit. I've been stuck in The Abyss
way too long.

286
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,287
How did you end up out here anyway?

287
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,588
Oh, I came with some other students.

288
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,591
Oh. Hey, sorry. I can, um... uh.

289
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,260
Spring Break, Class of 2016?

290
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,495
Didn't turn out so well for us,

291
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,563
but that is a whole other story.

292
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,598
Wait, sorry.

293
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,333
Do you know, um...

294
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,734
If the next two words out
of your mouth are "Josh"

295
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,170
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

296
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,239
No way. He's still alive?

297
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,408
I mean, as far as I know.

298
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,176
Oh, that's amazing.

299
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,744
So how does a Brakebills student

300
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,414
wind up alone on a raft?

301
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,350
Get a girl a drink.
I'll tell you the whole story.

302
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,551
All right.

303
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,234
Your Majesty.

304
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,402
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

305
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,228
Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

306
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,439
High Queen Margo let him go

307
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,740
as he was innocent of all charges.

308
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,377
Oh, right. Yeah.

309
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,611
Sorry about that.

310
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:28,288
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

311
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,191
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

312
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,393
An hour's ride North,
there is a forest

313
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,495
with naturally-occurring aphrodisiacs

314
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,331
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

315
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,467
Fine.

316
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,269
- But if you fail...
- I know, I know.

317
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,537
New keepsakes. Fingers, ears.

318
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,573
Try your spleen.

319
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,541
- Okay.
- Go.

320
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,612
Fieldwork was my thing at
Brakebills, and well, dragons.

321
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,281
Love them.

322
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,316
Wait, so what happened to your ship?

323
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,684
Oh, wrecked.

324
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,419
Off the coast of the Truthwaters.

325
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:02,289
I spent two years on that little Picket.

326
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,792
And, bam.
Over in an instant.

327
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,261
That was three weeks ago.

328
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,798
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

329
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,701
Yeah, it was rough.

330
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,369
Especially without magic.

331
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,604
Do you know anything
about why the hell

332
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,273
- it just went out?
- I mean, um...

333
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,442
I just hope someone's fixing it.

334
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,612
That someone is, um, sort of me.

335
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:30,717
Um, I'm on a... a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

336
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,385
Right, so there's seven of them.

337
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,522
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Golden keys?

338
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,789
Like...

339
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,682
- Holy shit. How did you...
- Short version?

340
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,431
Stole it.

341
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,599
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

342
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,269
just, like, covered in treasure.

343
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,470
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

344
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,339
Spontaneous orgasm.

345
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,574
I mean, places like this are so rare.

346
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,343
There are only two species of dragon

347
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,577
that even build treasure-nests.

348
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,746
Anyway, this was in one of them

349
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,614
with a bunch of cool stuff.

350
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,384
But the thing that got me was

351
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,852
I could feel something coming off it.

352
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,355
- Yeah.
- Even now.

353
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,258
It's somehow not dead, right?

354
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,626
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

355
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,628
so I just took it.

356
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:16,547
Just like that?

357
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,532
I'm a person of questionable ethics.

358
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,335
Here.

359
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,639
It's yours, from one quester to another.

360
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,643
Wow. Thank you.

361
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,712
So do you know what it does?
I mean, each one

362
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,347
sort of has a unique thing.

363
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,383
I don't know.

364
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,552
- Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

365
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,589
Uh, here's to that.

366
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,432
- You wanna? Yeah.
- Oh.

367
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,305
- Okay.
- Well, here goes nothing.

368
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,814
Ugh, man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

369
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,716
You're gonna kill yourselves!

370
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,420
- Oh, my God. I can't...
- Golly Moses.

371
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,388
You're right.
They're gonna kill themselves.

372
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,657
Don't you have some shower
to go haunt?

373
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,759
Oh, no one's showering right now.

374
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,828
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

375
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,963
Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

376
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,699
Ah, just a bit zozzled, I think.

377
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,836
He was quite naked.

378
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,739
Remarkably... well-preserved.

379
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,743
Guess it's possible to age gracefully.

380
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,977
Oh, my God.

381
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,547
Fuck, man. I can't watch this.

382
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,982
See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

383
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,884
You act like you don't care,

384
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,720
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

385
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,789
Yeah, then... then why
is everyone acting

386
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,758
like I'm not a part of it anymore?

387
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:56,396
Maybe it's time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

388
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:57,887
- You mean, leave?
- Why not?

389
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,766
Go... go find a story to watch

390
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,634
that doesn't make you so depressed.

391
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,704
Oh, I think they did it.

392
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,513
I'm having a good time.

393
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,852
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close...

394
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,979
Rise and shine, princess.

395
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,283
Who?

396
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,319
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

397
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,321
to black out after, what, five drinks?

398
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,955
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

399
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,857
I don't...

400
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,493
Okay. Uh...

401
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,865
Seriously.

402
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,568
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

403
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,907
Sorry, um, can you... Are you...
Are you seeing this?

404
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,778
Nobody cares, dude.

405
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,348
They all have actual jobs, unlike you.

406
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,015
Right, okay.

407
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,784
No problem.

408
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,559
- What the fuck did you do?
- Okay, I can explain.

409
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,561
- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

410
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,863
- It's all right.
- There's another me.

411
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,031
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

412
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,867
Nothing about this is all right.

413
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,002
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

414
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,372
- The key does have a power.
- No shit.

415
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,906
It takes the darkest parts of you

416
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:50,042
and makes a... kind of...
well, you met it.

417
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:53,480
It's kind of like a depression monster?

418
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:57,350
Looks like you, talks like you.

419
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:00,420
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

420
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,455
- Unless...
- Unless?

421
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,890
Unless it gets in your head

422
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,057
and convinces you to hurt yourself.

423
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,926
- Well...
- But you'll be fine.

424
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,928
It only affects the last person
who touched the key.

425
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,963
So just pass it along to someone else.

426
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,066
- That's what we did.
- Who's we?

427
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,468
My former shipmates.

428
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,869
After I stole the key,

429
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,405
we passed it from person to person

430
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,140
until we, you know, ran out of options.

431
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,543
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

432
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:26,635
Um. Hit an iceberg?

433
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,415
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

434
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,583
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

435
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,385
You have to be, like, a badass about it,

436
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,120
and what can I say?

437
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,988
- They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

438
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,091
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

439
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:41,584
Eh. Maybe, like, half?

440
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,596
This key made half of your shipmates

441
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,965
kill themselves, and you gave it to me?

442
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,900
Yeah. But don't worry.

443
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,970
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

444
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,039
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

445
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,108
Mmmm, no. No, no.

446
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,445
I'm not. This is like...

447
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,879
It's like we're on a boat, okay?

448
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,548
This is not how I usually am.

449
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,416
You're usually a wet blanket,
self-pitying,

450
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,584
party pooping dickwad.

451
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,586
Shut up!

452
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,888
You better pass that along fast.

453
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,458
What? No! Not if there is a 50%

454
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,959
chance of it killing the next person.

455
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,999
Right, yep. I'll just hold on to it.

456
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,068
Until we get back to Whitespire.

457
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,136
- I can do that.
- Your choice.

458
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,738
I mean, we're stuck in The Abyss

459
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,973
till we found our way out.

460
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,742
It could be days. It could be weeks.

461
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,911
Oh, but hey. Don't stress.

462
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,547
- You might be fine.
- You won't be.

463
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:36,506
You know what?

464
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,486
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

465
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,754
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

466
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,456
that I've got a black belt.

467
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,924
So come at me.

468
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,930
The problem is your hair.

469
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,532
I know you're just trying
to hide your face,

470
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,634
but it really only makes it worse.

471
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,168
Seriously, have you ever noticed

472
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,770
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

473
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,506
If feet had frown lines?

474
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,541
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

475
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,511
which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

476
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:07,079
Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

477
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,049
And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

478
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,684
a senile frowny foot-face.

479
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,086
Jesus. Fuck.

480
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,158
This is pointless. You can't run me off.

481
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,529
You can't eat me off.

482
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,665
You can't drink me off.

483
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,602
You can't jerk me off.

484
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,003
God, you're so vulgar.

485
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,706
We had a thing going,
and you... you made it

486
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,608
unnecessarily gross.

487
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,211
You sick of the shallow, petty stuff?

488
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,681
I get it.

489
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,616
The thing is, I start on the outside,

490
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,785
and I work my way into the core.

491
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,522
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

492
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,790
when you could have helped her,

493
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,126
that is what set her on that path.

494
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,565
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

495
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,266
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

496
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,101
You ruined her.

497
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,737
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

498
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,273
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

499
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:11,310
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

500
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,112
Just stop!

501
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,548
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

502
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,084
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

503
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,119
But you are never gonna feel okay.

504
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,822
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

505
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,290
Quentin.

506
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,760
I am your head.

507
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,763
You know I'm right because I am you.

508
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:40,339
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

509
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,742
Fomar.

510
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,276
Bottoms up.

511
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:49,716
Uh, in my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

512
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,852
- Drink the wine, Margo.
- I don't wanna drink the wine.

513
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,187
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

514
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,056
You'll feel better if you just

515
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,059
drink the wine, Margo.

516
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,173
So, um...

517
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,676
Do we have sex in the carriage?

518
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,311
Or do we have sex outside?

519
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,616
- Or do...
- I'm not having sex with you.

520
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,086
You psychotic fetus.

521
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,655
Ever.

522
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,898
Either I just killed him with my rage

523
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,332
or you drugged his wine.

524
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,201
And to think...

525
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,603
- You doubted me.
- To think.

526
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:50,142
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

527
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,278
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

528
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,814
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

529
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,749
than sleeping beauty over here.

530
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,885
The fairies are up to something
in the Northern Orchards.

531
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,853
They evacuated the villagers weeks ago

532
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:03,122
and haven't let another human in since.

533
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,358
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

534
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,427
and he saw some crazy shit.

535
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,963
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

536
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,933
mutant plant life, Chernobyl-level shit.

537
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,936
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

538
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,439
Great, well, now I can't be mad at you.

539
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,141
Thanks.

540
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,143
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

541
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,245
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

542
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,848
- we could just...
- Be us again?

543
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,850
Who are we now, El?

544
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,251
We used to be glamorous,

545
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,954
amazing mega-bitches.

546
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,455
And now?

547
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,893
We have depth and character.

548
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,930
Let's decide... we'll find us again

549
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,265
once we're done saving Fillory.

550
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,337
Duty calls.

551
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,305
Let's go see about these orchards.

552
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,680
Which are...

553
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,519
No longer here.

554
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:14,460
Nothing is going to save you.

555
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,029
Not Brakebills.

556
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:20,032
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

557
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,869
Just do it.

558
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,871
Kill yourself.

559
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,439
Make it stop.

560
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,809
You know the way out.

561
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,021
King Quentin, no!

562
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,156
Oh, no, I wasn't. I was just...

563
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,925
- I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

564
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,394
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

565
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,930
I thought about it too.

566
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:54,333
Though I've never spoken
about it, of course.

567
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,192
Why not?

568
00:28:56,202 --> 00:29:00,206
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

569
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:05,211
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

570
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:09,048
and turn them into, um,
maps, for example.

571
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,217
Jesus, Benedict.

572
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,085
Okay, we should talk about this.

573
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,087
If it please you, Sire, but first,

574
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,189
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

575
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:23,863
Yeah. I don't really trust
myself right now.

576
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:28,334
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

577
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,002
the crew would tie them to the mast.

578
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:32,004
Isn't that funny?

579
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:33,472
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

580
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:40,112
- No... no, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

581
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,882
Okay, swear to me, no matter what I say,

582
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,953
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

583
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:50,256
Very well. I won't.

584
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,024
Thank you.

585
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,387
It worked.

586
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,025
Thank you.

587
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:19,211
Oh. I see the transfer worked.

588
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,348
It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

589
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,583
I hope you'll be careful.

590
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,486
I will be.

591
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,490
You know that fixing my glasses

592
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,625
won't fix me.

593
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,561
Yeah, but they make all of this

594
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,164
one speck less shitty.

595
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,339
It smells like the fairy realm.

596
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,509
We're so far North.

597
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,412
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

598
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,115
Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

599
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,518
All that spritzing and bathing.

600
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,088
You know, it's... it's like
they're afraid

601
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,024
to dry out in Fillory or something.

602
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,128
Oh, my God.

603
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,365
The fuckers are terraforming.

604
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,168
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

605
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,669
- That is not okay.
- No.

606
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,338
Definitely not.

607
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,143
That mushroom just moved.

608
00:32:24,153 --> 00:32:26,353
- Really?
- Should I pluck it?

609
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,249
I'm... I'm gonna do it.

610
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,051
Mm. Margo, don't.

611
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,333
It's a fairy embryo.

612
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,602
- Really?
- These are eggs, El.

613
00:32:50,612 --> 00:32:52,261
I mean, really?

614
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,140
The fairies aren't just terraforming.

615
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,275
They're growing an army.

616
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:57,617
Oh, fuck.

617
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,380
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

618
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,251
I mean, think about all the crazy shit

619
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,019
they've kept us busy with.

620
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,522
Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

621
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,459
This is all just
a thin frosting of whimsy

622
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,562
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

623
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,032
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

624
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,568
We need a plan bigger than just
assassinating the Queen.

625
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,172
We need... we need... we
need... we need... we need...

626
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:29,141
We need... Margo?

627
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,212
Margo?

628
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,114
Kidnapping. Hostages. Leverage.

629
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,736
- Don't ask questions, go! Go!
- What the fuck?

630
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,052
Go, go!

631
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,820
It's a bitch, right?

632
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,832
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

633
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,601
Have you tried distracting it?

634
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,570
For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

635
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,239
Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

636
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,074
Please, fuck off.

637
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,510
Look, I'm sorry I passed you the key.

638
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,844
I really thought you could handle it.

639
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,746
This is me handling it.

640
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,749
No, no, you're right.

641
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,185
I wish we'd thought of tying
ourselves up.

642
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,521
That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

643
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,356
That killed three of us off quick.

644
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,191
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

645
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,227
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

646
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,162
Others, it takes time to wear down.

647
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,301
You want me to take the key for a while?
Give you some relief?

648
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,703
No.

649
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,273
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

650
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,642
And I need it.

651
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,677
- For the quest.
- Fine.

652
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,812
Be a suffer-martyr.

653
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,648
Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

654
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,683
They help sometimes, too.

655
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,853
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

656
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,388
Keyholes, like...

657
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,125
Like in the walls or clocks.

658
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,261
Don't ask me how it works.

659
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,629
So... so where do the keyholes go?

660
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:01,300
To Earth or the Neitherlands
or wherever.

661
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,602
Wait, wait. Are you serious?

662
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,742
Stop it. What are you doing?

663
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,178
I've been stuck here in
Fillory this whole time

664
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,412
when I could have gone home?

665
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,148
Hey. No, Poppy, stop it.

666
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,684
Poppy, no. Stop.

667
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,153
Poppy!

668
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,289
I told you
you should've killed yourself.

669
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:33,799
Okay, we just have one
outstanding problem.

670
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,367
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

671
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,669
Don't worry. I got this.

672
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:46,712
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

673
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,881
- They've got three eyes?
- No, baby.

674
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,783
They've got fangs.

675
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:01,260
Oh! Oh, something bit my manhood.

676
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,329
Congratulations, son. You just had sex.

677
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,231
The first time's always painful.

678
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,433
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

679
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:11,203
But, hey, you were amazing.

680
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,339
What?

681
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,940
I like to watch.

682
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,869
Wanna go again?

683
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,215
Benedict!

684
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:28,720
Benedict, help!

685
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:29,988
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my God, Benedict.

686
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,658
- Okay, untie me.
- Sire, you said not to untie you.

687
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,227
No. No, no, no, no, no. Please, come on.
Okay, look.

688
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:36,762
I'm not trying to kill myself.

689
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,697
Poppy took the key, and she is trying

690
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,232
to use it to get back to Earth.

691
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,933
Just... okay, go find her yourself.

692
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,703
Just whatever you do, do not
let her leave with that key.

693
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,871
Yes, Your Majesty.

694
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,207
God.

695
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,012
No! Stop!

696
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,427
- Hey, did you get it?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

697
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,464
I'm a terrible failure.

698
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,766
Okay. It's okay.

699
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,703
We'll get the key back somehow.

700
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,978
Benedict.

701
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,784
Hey, hey. Benedict.

702
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,553
Whoa, Benedict, no. Hey, listen.

703
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,357
Whatever it's telling you
to do, do not do it.

704
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,759
I'm sorry.

705
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,993
Benedict, no!

706
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,741

712
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,957
Penny, what's wrong?

713
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,970
- Just saying goodbye.
- What?

714
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,573
Goodbye? Where are you going?

715
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:28,840
Just away.

716
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,876
Away... wait.

717
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,480
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um. I don't understand.

718
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,847
Is this because
of what happened with Kady?

719
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,449
- No.
- Okay.

720
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,717
Is it because we did the transfer?

721
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,952
No. Look, I gotta go.

722
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,654
Wait, will you just
talk to me for a second?

723
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,990
You know what,
we barely know each other.

724
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,893
Don't suddenly act like
you care just 'cause I'm going.

725
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,561
I'm not acting.

726
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,564
I do care. I don't want to see you go.
I don't want to see you give up.

727
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:54,766
- Give up?
- Yeah.

728
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,904
You're the one who had magic,
and you gave it away.

729
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,840
What's your plan? Go back to law school?

730
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,642
Live off your trust fund?

731
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,378
Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

732
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,747
and try to remember what life was like

733
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,982
without a god or a quest.

734
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,751
Or some dead asshole bothering me.

735
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,520
And, I don't know, frankly beyond that,

736
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:15,754
it's none of your business.

737
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,624
'Cause you have nothing beyond that.

738
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,798
Penny wants to say goodbye.

739
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:32,771
- You're leaving?
- I can't do this anymore.

740
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:36,642
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

741
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,782
Why don't I just make you a new body?

742
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,617
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

743
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,571
A-plus job

744
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:08,073
getting rid of me, gorgeous.

745
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,765
Is this just a dream?

746
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,745
That time you fell out
of a tree when you were 12.

747
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:17,816
The bone in your arm healed
in six little weeks.

748
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,519
How come your fear of heights never did?

749
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:27,526
I'm not the bone.

750
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,762
I'm the terror.

751
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,467
I do love how you keep trying.

752
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:41,840
And trying. And trying.

753
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,948
I have not been punched

754
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,517
that hard since Burning Man.

755
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,520
Where is he? Where did he go?

756
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,723
Why does it smell like barbeque?

757
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,995
Benedict is dead,
and best-case-scenario,

758
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,597
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

759
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,699
- Um, Quentin.
- Don't talk to me.

760
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:09,735
- Please, I mean it.
- Okay.

761
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,737
Just... Just one thing

762
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,505
and I swear I will never
talk to you again.

763
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:14,630
What?

764
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,642
Dragons don't shit.

765
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,677
Okay, great, fun fact. Thanks.

766
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,111
No one knows exactly how it works,

767
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,881
but what they ingest goes elsewhere.

768
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,650
They're gatekeepers, you know?

769
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,151
They don't just make portals.

770
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,153
They are portals.

771
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,757
So, actual best-case-scenario...

772
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,626
The key went to the Underworld.

773
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,962
- Mm.
- Oh, my God.

774
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,671
If you're here, I'm practicing

775
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,939
an Osseus Confervium. Bone-knitting.

776
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,808
First step to building a new body.

777
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:54,646
I know you can't see me, but I'm here.

778
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,047
Thanks for giving a shit about me.

779
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,821
Alice?

780
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,191
Alice, you okay? Alice?

781
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,127
God, Alice. Alice!

782
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,631
God, this is... where's...

783
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,099
Alice!

784
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:21,673
Okay, okay, God. Come on.

785
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:24,976
Come on, someone's got
