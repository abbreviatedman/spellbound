1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,633
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:03,966
<i>We found a key, too.</i>

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,165
The ghost said it has the power

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,450
to reveal things
that are hidden.

5
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,635
I'm a hidden thing.

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:09,972
I'm Hyman.

7
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,409
When I first got stuck

8
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,276
in the astral plane,

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,748
I spent months
trying to push things.

10
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:16,977
I never got anywhere.

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,383
Until I tried being the thing.

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,382
Holy zerts! You did it!

13
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,089
The farmers are hesitant

14
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,148
because you're asking
them to throw out food

15
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,093
- and replace it with, uh...
- Inedible mushrooms.

16
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,721
I got it. I just need it done.

17
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,660
<i>On Earth we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first.</i>

18
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,534
<i>Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.</i>

19
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,274
It is my duty and honor

20
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,276
to take the place
of my late brother.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,655
<i>Why do you have magic?</i>
JULIA: <i>I don't know.</i>

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,170
I'd do anything to get it back.

23
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,443
If I could give it
to you, I would.

24
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,284
What if you could?

25
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,993
Whoo. Sorry.

26
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,589
Okay.

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,635
Last I checked, we're
looking for a spell,

28
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,227
not starting an eBay store.

29
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,399
There's this old hedge
story I once heard

30
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,533
about some sort
of electrical transfer

31
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,046
Marina used to steal
magic from some poor faun.

32
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,546
People still talk about it.

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,207
Just look.

34
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,318
So, you want us
to reverse engineer

35
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,823
a hedge witch urban
legend using kids' toys?

36
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,190
I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,126
so unless you
have a better idea...

38
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,279
Do you feel anything?

39
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,412
No.

40
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,783
Go again?

41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,357
<i>Oh, as long as I know</i>

42
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,057
<i>How to love I
know I'll stay alive</i>

43
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,066
Why did that just
turn on by itself?

44
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,290
Oh, my God.

45
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,730
<i>I've got all my love to give</i>

46
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,236
<i>And I'll survive</i>

47
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,700
Give me your hand.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,802
Wait. Stop.

49
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,542
Do not do this.

50
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,521
Did you just use that
fish as a doorbell?

51
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,223
I've been trying to warn
you guys for, like, an hour.

52
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,207
Being the fish button is the first
thing in this entire room that's worked.

53
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,461
What are you trying
to warn us about?

54
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,485
This spell.

55
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,182
I've seen it in person.

56
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,381
Are you serious?

57
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,117
Yeah.

58
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,716
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

59
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,785
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,722
do the transfer,
and by the end of it,

61
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,733
everyone was on fire.

62
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,561
Trust me. Fogg was right.

63
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,571
It's a bad idea.

64
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,375
Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

65
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,566
Oh...

66
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,770
Fuck me.

67
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,369
You have magic.

68
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,842
And you're just now telling me?

69
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,406
Don't take this the wrong way,

70
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,748
but you've been a little drunk.

71
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,913
And unreliable. Yes.

72
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,489
I'm drunk, but I
am entirely reliable.

73
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,928
Um, maybe we should
get back to Marina's spell.

74
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,157
It wasn't Marina's
spell. It's mine.

75
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,464
She stole it from
my private collection.

76
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,635
And if any of you had
attended my annual colloquia

77
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,141
on prohibited magic,
you would know

78
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,643
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

79
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,703
It is incredibly delicate.

80
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,645
We know that, but... But what?

81
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,308
But you want to rid yourself

82
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,818
of the one thing we all
so desperately want?

83
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,251
If you understood what...

84
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
You understand.

85
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,785
I'm a Magician with no magic.

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,420
A dean without a school.

87
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,958
Just a blind, unemployed

88
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,191
black man in America.

89
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:57,263
Which, shockingly, was actually
being kept 38% more tolerant

90
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,431
through a series of enchantments

91
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,441
which have now died.

92
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,668
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

93
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,621
in a position to need to.
Okay, you're really drunk.

94
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,645
So what?

95
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,280
What does it matter?

96
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,818
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

97
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,479
than to attempt this.

98
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,955
You want to blow
yourselves up? Is that it?

99
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,253
Um... Just give me one second.

100
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,362
Okay.

101
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,795
Uh, they'll hold
for a day or two,

102
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,694
but then Alice
can recharge them.

103
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,230
After we finish the transfer.

104
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,434
I know. Everything is fucked.

105
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,274
I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

106
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,935
Julia.

107
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,569
Yeah, well, it's not
not my fault either, so...

108
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,615
What you two utter idiots need,

109
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,013
if you don't want to die,

110
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,414
is the flesh of a
magical creature

111
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,580
to act as a sort
of semiconductor.

112
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,353
A potent energy-drainer.
An incubus.

113
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,429
If this is about the whole

114
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,842
marriage not being
consummated yet,

115
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,858
don't worry, it'll happen.

116
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,129
Oh, no, no, no. You
misunderstand me, my dear.

117
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,697
See, I've heard a rumor
about your adviser,

118
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,570
the Pickwick? Sighted
in a certain corridor,

119
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,304
taking scrapings from the wall.

120
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,175
He's just a
compulsive redecorator.

121
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,781
You might be interested to
know that we both have been

122
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,444
plotting against
our mutual friend.

123
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,812
Hmm.

124
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,548
No idea what
you're talking about.

125
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,224
Margo.

126
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,791
You can trust me.

127
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,761
The misguided actions of my son

128
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,492
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

129
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,559
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

130
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,129
When the time is right,

131
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,697
we could use it to
kill the Fairy Queen.

132
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,277
Hi. Oh, hell, no.

133
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,107
Move.

134
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,653
Hang your sheets out the
window afterwards, dear.

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,689
Guards! Guards!

136
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,815
Don't even think
about closing it. No!

137
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,122
Guards!

138
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,053
Let me out!

139
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,720
I don't give a shit if you
have to find someone

140
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,144
to sell those shares short.

141
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,874
I need them today.

142
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,543
So the incubus is a
hedge fund manager?

143
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,009
Plus 5%.

144
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,019
And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

145
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,714
Just remember what Fogg said.

146
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,887
Be respectful, no matter what.

147
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,889
You got two minutes.

148
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,494
Henry Fogg said
that you might be able

149
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,995
to help us power our spell.

150
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,762
Uh... We just... We
need to use your thing.

151
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,527
My what? Your... Your thing.

152
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,765
Your... Your business.

153
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,437
Sorry?

154
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,639
Your little friend. Uh, I
mean... Your big friend.

155
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,569
Well, I'm sure your friend

156
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,706
is perfectly proportioned
to your body.

157
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,082
I was just saying... Your penis.

158
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,551
Yep, we need to use your
penis to power our spell.

159
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,421
And we know that
you need it too.

160
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,585
So that's why we'll
build the spell around it.

161
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,026
It'll be completely painless

162
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,723
and should only
take a couple minutes.

163
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,677
I can't believe that
actually worked!

164
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,646
Wha... What actually worked?

165
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,545
I planted this joke
on Fogg 25 years ago.

166
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,847
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

167
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,911
Wait, so you... You
don't have a magic...

168
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,149
Of course not.

169
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,756
That's ridiculous. No, it's not.

170
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,588
I mean, you're an incubus.

171
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,958
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

172
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,853
Gods no.

173
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,759
I don't even like sex.

174
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,792
Stress is a much better
way to drain people's energy.

175
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,030
May I?

176
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,140
Oh, and you.

177
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,682
You got a lot of it, I can tell.

178
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,245
Delish.

179
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,582
You give me a few
more hits of this,

180
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,920
and I'll give you something

181
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,188
that'll actually
power your spell.

182
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,804
Is that your tail? Yeah.

183
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,601
Yeah, I grow a new
one every spring.

184
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,142
Welcome back.

185
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,941
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

186
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,313
You'd be shocked how
easy it is to misplace people

187
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,649
when your mind's on tax
collection and annexation

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,849
and unforeseen
seafaring confusion.

189
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,970
I'll immediately sail back
out there and find them,

190
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,656
of course... No, you won't.

191
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,164
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

192
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,158
The Stone Queen has locked

193
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,065
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

194
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,227
Wait. What? Why?

195
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,069
She thinks it will get the
marriage consummated,

196
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,872
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

197
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,640
just as much as the Floaters do.

198
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,437
Listen, pro tip.

199
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,674
Let Margo out of
there immediately.

200
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,844
You know her. Force
isn't going to work.

201
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,889
True. Force may not work.

202
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,125
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

203
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,683
I am not going to coerce Margo

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,661
into having sex
with a 15-year-old.

205
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,356
Have you never
heard of statutory rape?

206
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,298
Fomar isn't a statue.
That is not what...

207
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,198
Forget it. You will solve
this problem for me.

208
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,097
And if I refuse?

209
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,305
I've been searching
for a new keepsake.

210
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,106
Several bits will do.

211
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,308
Fine, but I have a
feeling Queen Margo

212
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,317
is going to be a
little bit difficult.

213
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,350
I know!

214
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,221
You hate me for killing Micah.

215
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,089
Oh, Jesus Christ.

216
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,758
It's just, in our culture,

217
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,992
younger sons can't
marry or inherit property.

218
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,897
Most of us wind up

219
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,835
serving in the Crag
Guard or dying in battle.

220
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,895
Is this supposed to
make me feel bad for you?

221
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,105
No.

222
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,220
So, do you want to take a break?

223
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,976
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

224
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,955
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

225
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,419
into a decorative,
whimsical planter?

226
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,042
How are we supposed
to become one flesh

227
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,017
if you won't let me touch you?

228
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,911
We're not. But you're my wife.

229
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,486
Oh, please.

230
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,117
You don't need a wife.

231
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,093
You need a pile of
socks and a sex-ed class.

232
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,289
What's a sex class? Who's Ed?

233
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,807
It's something they
make you do on Earth.

234
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,094
It makes you never wanna.

235
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,961
How about I show you?

236
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,106
Vaginas.

237
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,579
The leading cause
of death in men.

238
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,672
They spread disease.

239
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,875
They explode during childbirth.

240
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,218
But worst of all, they
bleed. Every month.

241
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,458
In fact, mine's
doing it right now.

242
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,027
Well, that's okay. I like blood.

243
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,031
But do you like teeth?

244
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,166
Sorry I'm late.

245
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,563
You okay?

246
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,143
Enjoying being a palace
guard in your own palace?

247
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,236
This uniform is,
like, really sweaty.

248
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,304
Yeah, I know, but it beats

249
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,246
having the Fairy
Queen's hand up your ass.

250
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,342
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

251
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,077
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

252
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,015
Uh, okay, so I'm
pretty sure that

253
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,819
the fourth key is somewhere

254
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,418
in this stretch of
ocean called The Abyss.

255
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,395
Um, it's an uncharted
region of Fillory

256
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,796
where it's, like, sort
of permanently night.

257
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,026
Um...

258
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,502
But, you know, we get to go

259
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,905
on a quest on a magical
boat, so it doesn't totally suck.

260
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,774
Yeah. I wish I could.

261
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,912
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

262
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,314
And I can't leave
Margo. Right, of course.

263
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,352
Sorry. No.

264
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,887
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

265
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,513
Who wouldn't?

266
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,817
Think about it. You
can take Benedict.

267
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,387
Go be life partners with
someone else for a little bit.

268
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,763
But you'll be able to do the...
Thing on the prow of a ship

269
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,377
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

270
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,428
What thing? You know, the thing.

271
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,910
Whoo!

272
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,955
Sorry. Sorry.

273
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,131
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

274
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,621
Being on a mission is a
hell of an antidepressant.

275
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,093
You notice that, Benedict?

276
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,891
Well, now that you mention it.

277
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,429
Whoa.

278
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,195
We're entering The Abyss, Sire.

279
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,205
It'll be darkness from here on.

280
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,241
Thank you.

281
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,924
So how long until
we can keep going?

282
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,325
As soon as we find safe
passage, Your Majesty.

283
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,460
Is someone out there?

284
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,192
Help!

285
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,196
Is someone out there? Help!

286
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,236
God, I think there's
someone out there on a raft.

287
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,042
You okay?

288
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,080
Wow, wow, wow. You just
saved the shit out of me.

289
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,586
Poppy Kline.

290
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,127
Draconologist, postgraduate
fellow, and field researcher

291
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,423
at your service.

292
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,496
Holy shit. You're
from Brakebills?

293
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,933
Yeah.

294
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,769
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

295
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,868
Yeah. Shit.

296
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,914
I've been stuck in The
Abyss way too long.

297
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,225
How did you end
up out here anyway?

298
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,547
I came with some other students.

299
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,547
Oh, hey, sorry. I can... Uh...

300
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,885
Spring Break, Class of 2016?

301
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,462
Didn't turn out so well for us,

302
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,254
but that is a
whole 'nother story.

303
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,793
Wait, sorry.

304
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,225
Do you know, um...

305
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,773
If the next two words out
of your mouth are "Josh"

306
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,028
and "Hoberman," we
just became best friends.

307
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,091
No way. He's still alive?

308
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,666
I mean, as far as I know.

309
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,035
Oh, that's amazing.

310
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,733
So how does a Brakebills student

311
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,072
wind up alone on a raft?

312
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,243
Get a girl a drink. I'll
tell you the whole story.

313
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,541
All right.

314
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,092
Your Majesty.

315
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,290
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

316
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,060
Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

317
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,362
High Queen Margo let him go

318
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,754
as he was innocent
of all charges.

319
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,937
Oh, right. Yeah.

320
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,602
Sorry about that.

321
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:24,141
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

322
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,016
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

323
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,278
An hour's ride
north, there is a forest

324
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,415
with naturally-occurring
aphrodisiacs

325
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,188
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

326
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,191
Fine.

327
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,124
But if you fail...
I know, I know.

328
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,496
New keepsakes. Fingers, ears.

329
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,501
Try your spleen.

330
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,503
Okay. Go.

331
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,569
Fieldwork was my thing at
Brakebills, and well, dragons.

332
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,132
Love them.

333
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,041
Wait, so what
happened to your ship?

334
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,039
Oh. Wrecked.

335
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,357
Off the coast of
the Truthwaters.

336
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,146
I spent two years
on that little picket.

337
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,016
And, bam. Over in an instant.

338
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,419
That was three weeks ago.

339
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,786
You survived for three
weeks on a raft by yourself?

340
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,823
Yeah, it was rough.

341
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,261
Especially without magic.

342
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,575
Do you know anything
about why the hell

343
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,125
it just went out? I mean...

344
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,330
I just hope someone's fixing it.

345
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,135
That someone is, um, sort of me.

346
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,809
I'm on a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

347
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,279
Right, so there's seven of them.

348
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,215
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Golden keys?

349
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,815
Like...

350
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,518
Holy shit. How did you...

351
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,590
Short version?

352
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,052
Stole it.

353
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,521
Mid-voyage we wound
up on this random island,

354
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,121
just, like, covered in treasure.

355
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,708
A dragon breeding
ground which is like...

356
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,200
Ah. Spontaneous orgasm.

357
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,503
I mean, places
like this are so rare.

358
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,198
There are only two
species of dragon

359
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,511
that even build treasure-nests.

360
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,701
Anyway, this was in one of them

361
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,539
with a bunch of cool stuff.

362
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,239
But the thing that got me was

363
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,838
I could feel something
coming off it.

364
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,213
Yeah. Even now.

365
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,411
It's somehow not dead, right?

366
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,553
And, you know, the dragons
were all horny and distracted,

367
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,215
so I just took it.

368
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,052
Just like that?

369
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm a person of
questionable ethics.

370
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,220
Here.

371
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,598
It's yours, from one
quester to another.

372
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,735
Wow. Thank you.

373
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,716
So do you know what it does?

374
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,209
I mean, each one sort
of has a unique thing.

375
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,437
I don't know.

376
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,440
Maybe you can
figure it out. Yeah.

377
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,479
Uh... Here's to that.

378
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,317
You wanna? Yeah. Oh.

379
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,123
Okay. Well, here goes nothing.

380
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,765
Ugh. Man, one of your
wires is coming loose.

381
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,641
You're gonna kill yourselves!

382
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:09,079
Oh, my God. I
can't... Golly Moses.

383
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,249
You're right. They're
gonna kill themselves.

384
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,582
Don't you have some
shower to go haunt?

385
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,383
Oh, no one's
showering right now.

386
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,689
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

387
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,588
Jesus, that man needs
help. Is he all right?

388
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,629
Just a bit zozzled, I think.

389
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,423
He was quite naked.

390
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,691
Remarkably well-preserved.

391
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,335
Guess it's possible
to age gracefully.

392
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,967
Oh, my God.

393
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,009
Fuck, man. I can't watch this.

394
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,377
See? This is what I
love about you, Penny.

395
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,844
You act like you don't care,

396
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,644
but really, you care
most in this whole story.

397
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,749
Yeah, then... Then
why is everyone acting

398
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,684
like I'm not a part
of it anymore?

399
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:52,157
Maybe it's time to
blouse this popsicle stand.

400
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,815
You mean, leave? Why not?

401
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,691
Go find a story to watch

402
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,525
that doesn't make
you so depressed.

403
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,594
Oh, I think they did it.

404
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,735
I'm having a good time.

405
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,542
Mmm.

406
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,708
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close...

407
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,572
Rise and shine, princess.

408
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,674
Who?

409
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,715
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

410
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,716
to black out after,
what, five drinks?

411
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,543
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

412
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,609
I don't...

413
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,716
Okay.

414
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,516
Um...

415
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,991
Seriously.

416
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,056
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

417
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,460
Sorry, um, can you... Are
you... Are you seeing this?

418
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,330
Nobody cares, dude.

419
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,842
They all have actual
jobs, unlike you.

420
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,375
Right, okay.

421
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,976
No problem.

422
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,054
What the fuck did you
do? Okay, I can explain.

423
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,056
What is this key?
Just calm down.

424
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,422
It's all right.
There's another me.

425
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,620
And he's mean, and
no one else can see him.

426
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,424
Nothing about this is all right.

427
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,260
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

428
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,793
The key does have
a power. No shit.

429
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,495
It takes the
darkest parts of you

430
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,471
and makes a kind
of... Well, you met it.

431
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,935
It's kind of like a
depression monster?

432
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,638
Looks like you, talks like you.

433
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,247
But don't worry, it
can't actually hurt you.

434
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,918
Unless... Unless?

435
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,452
Unless it gets in your head

436
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,696
and convinces
you to hurt yourself.

437
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,518
Well... But you'll be fine.

438
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,567
It only affects the last
person who touched the key.

439
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,560
So just pass it along
to someone else.

440
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,687
That's what we did. Who's we?

441
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,924
My former shipmates.

442
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,431
After I stole the key,

443
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,831
we passed it from
person to person

444
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,768
until we, you know,
ran out of options.

445
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,999
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

446
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,263
Um...

447
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,808
Hit an iceberg?

448
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,886
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

449
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,902
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

450
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,808
You have to be, like,
a badass about it,

451
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,747
and what can I say?

452
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,580
They were weak. Okay, I'm sorry.

453
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,678
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

454
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,015
Hmm. Maybe, like, half?

455
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,089
This key made half
of your shipmates

456
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,560
kill themselves, and
you gave it to me?

457
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,460
Yeah. But don't worry.

458
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,329
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

459
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,627
You'll be fine. You're
so happy and positive.

460
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,637
No. No, no.

461
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,865
I'm not. This is like...

462
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,431
It's like we're on a boat, okay?

463
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,999
This is not how I usually am.

464
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,841
You're usually a wet
blanket, self-pitying,

465
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,039
party pooping dickwad.

466
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,048
Shut up!

467
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,447
You better pass that along fast.

468
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,884
What? No! Not if there is a 50%

469
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,512
chance of it killing
the next person.

470
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,716
Okay.

471
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,190
Right, yep. I'll
just hold on to it.

472
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,358
Until we get back to Whitespire.

473
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,757
I can do that. Your choice.

474
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,233
I mean, we're stuck in The Abyss

475
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,530
till we found our way out.

476
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,626
It could be days.

477
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,296
It could be weeks.

478
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,437
But hey. Don't stress.

479
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,009
You might be fine. You won't be.

480
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,408
You know what?

481
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,675
I have come up against
you before, asshole.

482
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,246
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

483
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,751
that I've got a black belt.

484
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,250
So come at me.

485
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,483
The problem is your hair.

486
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,037
I know you're just
trying to hide your face,

487
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,757
but it really only
makes it worse.

488
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,791
Seriously, have you ever noticed

489
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,309
that your face sort
of looks like a foot?

490
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,926
If feet had frown lines?

491
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,993
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

492
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,938
which is a symptom of
early-onset Alzheimer's.

493
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,669
Which, funny, both
your grandparents had.

494
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,644
And you will definitely
get it so then you'll be

495
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,578
a senile frowny foot-face.

496
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,707
Jesus. Fuck.

497
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,618
This is pointless.
You can't run me off.

498
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,881
You can't eat me off.

499
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,758
You can't drink me off.

500
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,996
You can't jerk me off.

501
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,565
God, you're so vulgar.

502
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,193
We had a thing going,
and you... You made it

503
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,067
unnecessarily gross.

504
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,766
You sick of the
shallow, petty stuff?

505
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,274
I get it.

506
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,076
The thing is, I
start on the outside,

507
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,114
and I work my way into the core.

508
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,944
The part of you that
kept magic from Julia

509
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,281
when you could have helped her,

510
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,721
that is what set
her on that path.

511
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,282
You got your best
friend sexually assaulted.

512
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,222
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

513
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,628
You ruined her.

514
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,233
And she is never going
to be the girl that she was.

515
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,895
You killed her, and she
is never coming back.

516
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,929
How many people have to
pay the price for your heroics?

517
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,701
Just stop!

518
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,971
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

519
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,639
to find something that
makes you feel okay.

520
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,705
But you are never
gonna feel okay.

521
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,308
No, stop. You're
trying to get in my head.

522
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,951
Quentin.

523
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,256
I am your head.

524
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:27,259
You know I'm right
because I am you.

525
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,825
To Mr. and Mrs... Fomar.

526
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,698
Fomar.

527
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,534
Bottoms up.

528
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,175
In my culture, the
woman always drinks first.

529
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,740
Drink the wine, Margo.

530
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,338
I don't wanna drink the wine.

531
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,782
What I wanted was for
you to handle this, Eliot.

532
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,614
You'll feel better if you just

533
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,621
drink the wine, Margo.

534
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,830
So, um...

535
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,135
Do we have sex in the carriage?

536
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,936
Or do we have sex outside?

537
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:20,036
Or do... I'm not
having sex with you.

538
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,310
You psychotic fetus.

539
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,115
Ever.

540
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,393
Either I just killed
him with my rage

541
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,952
or you drugged his wine.

542
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,793
And to think...

543
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:39,991
You doubted me.

544
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,065
To think.

545
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,568
I just spent three days
locked in a dungeon with him.

546
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,866
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

547
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,274
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

548
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,209
than sleeping beauty over here.

549
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,322
The fairies are up to something

550
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,370
in the Northern Orchards.

551
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,348
They evacuated the
villagers weeks ago

552
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,681
and haven't let
another human in since.

553
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,983
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

554
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,047
and he saw some crazy shit.

555
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,457
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

556
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,428
mutant plant life,
Chernobyl-level shit.

557
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,432
I think the fairies might be
poisoning the ecosystem.

558
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,594
Great, well, now I
can't be mad at you.

559
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,263
Thanks.

560
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,705
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

561
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,852
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

562
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,070
we could just... Be us again?

563
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,304
Who are we now, El?

564
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,847
We used to be glamorous,

565
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,815
amazing mega-bitches.

566
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,917
And now?

567
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,714
We have depth and character.

568
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,426
Let's decide...
We'll find us again

569
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,825
once we're done saving Fillory.

570
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,158
Okay?

571
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,922
Duty calls.

572
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,901
Let's go see about
these orchards.

573
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,703
Which are...

574
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,576
No longer here.

575
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,050
Nothing is going to
save you. Not Brakebills.

576
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,459
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

577
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,324
Just do it.

578
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,332
Kill yourself.

579
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,664
Make it stop.

580
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,367
You know the way out.

581
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,950
King Quentin, no!

582
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,177
No, I wasn't. I was just...

583
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,931
I thought I saw
something. Your Majesty,

584
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,322
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

585
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,192
I thought about it too.

586
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,896
Though I have never
spoken about it, of course.

587
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,954
Why not?

588
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,497
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

589
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:01,706
That you should bottle them
up and never talk about them

590
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,971
and turn them into
maps, for example.

591
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,579
Jesus, Benedict.

592
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,111
Okay, we should talk about this.

593
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,117
If it please you,
Sire, but first,

594
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,244
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

595
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,785
Yeah. I don't really
trust myself right now.

596
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,195
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

597
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,524
the crew would tie
them to the mast.

598
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,995
Isn't that funny?

599
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,558
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

600
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,641
No... No, Your
Majesty. No, do it.

601
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,838
Okay, swear to me,
no matter what I say,

602
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,471
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

603
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,850
Very well. I won't.

604
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,752
Thank you.

605
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,876
It worked.

606
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,819
Thank you.

607
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,263
Oh, I see the transfer worked.

608
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,436
It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

609
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,002
I hope you'll be careful.

610
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,813
I will be.

611
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:28,279
You know that fixing my glasses

612
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,882
won't fix me.

613
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,688
Yeah, but they make all of this

614
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,283
one speck less shitty.

615
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,300
It smells like the fairy realm.

616
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,437
We're so far north.

617
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,505
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

618
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,942
Yeah, well, they're
such moisture freaks.

619
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,375
All that spritzing and bathing.

620
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,082
You know, it's...
It's like they're afraid

621
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,780
to dry out in Fillory
or something.

622
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,921
Oh, my God.

623
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,222
The fuckers are terraforming.

624
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,192
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

625
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,790
That is not okay. No.

626
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Definitely not.

627
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,572
That mushroom just moved.

628
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,140
Really? Should I pluck it?

629
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,279
I'm gonna do it.

630
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,075
Margo, don't.

631
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,153
Oh.

632
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,755
Uh...

633
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,322
It's a fairy embryo.

634
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,726
Really? These are eggs, El.

635
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,262
I mean, really?

636
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,132
The fairies aren't
just terraforming.

637
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,297
They're growing an army.

638
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,634
Oh, fuck.

639
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,544
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

640
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,843
I mean, think about
all the crazy shit

641
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,542
they've kept us busy with.

642
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:08,144
Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

643
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,088
This is all just a thin
frosting of whimsy

644
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,058
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

645
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,558
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

646
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,224
We need a plan bigger than
just assassinating the Queen.

647
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,735
We need... We need... We
need... We need... We need...

648
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,704
We need... Margo?

649
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,702
Margo?

650
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,640
Kidnapping. Hostages. Leverage.

651
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,408
Don't ask questions,
go! Go! What the fuck?

652
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,312
Go, go!

653
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,959
It's a bitch, right?

654
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,530
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

655
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,258
Have you tried distracting it?

656
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,028
For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

657
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,845
Wonder if that's
because I'm into seagulls?

658
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,599
Please, fuck off.

659
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,765
Look, I'm sorry I
passed you the key.

660
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,331
I really thought
you could handle it.

661
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,440
This is me handling it.

662
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,342
No, no, you're right.

663
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,744
I wish we'd thought
of tying ourselves up.

664
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,148
That first day, we
passed it around randomly.

665
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,880
That killed three
of us off quick.

666
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,750
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

667
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,790
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

668
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,383
Others, it takes
time to wear down.

669
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,673
You want me to take
the key for a while?

670
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,858
Give you some relief?

671
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,230
No.

672
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,596
I don't trust you not to
pass it on to someone else.

673
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,428
And I need it.

674
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,000
For the quest. Fine.

675
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,933
Be a suffer-martyr.

676
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,307
Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

677
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,778
They help sometimes, too.

678
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,077
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

679
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,778
Keyholes, like...

680
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,954
Like in the walls or clocks.

681
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,247
Don't ask me how it works.

682
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,258
So... So where do
the keyholes go?

683
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,855
To Earth or the
Neitherlands or wherever.

684
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,263
Wait, wait. Are you serious?

685
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,400
Stop it. What are you doing?

686
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,750
I've been stuck here
in Fillory this whole time

687
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,003
when I could have gone home?

688
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,671
Hey. No, Poppy, stop it.

689
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,340
Poppy, no. Stop.

690
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,814
Poppy!

691
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,878
I told you you
should've killed yourself.

692
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,915
Okay.

693
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,659
Okay, we just have
one outstanding problem.

694
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,928
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

695
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,591
Don't worry. I got this.

696
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,102
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

697
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,105
They've got three
eyes? No, baby.

698
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,137
They've got fangs.

699
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,784
Oh! Oh, something
bit my manhood.

700
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,883
Congratulations,
son. You just had sex.

701
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,757
The first time's always painful.

702
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,989
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

703
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,562
But, hey, you were amazing.

704
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,900
What?

705
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,665
I like to watch.

706
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,898
Wanna go again?

707
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:17,967
Hmm?

708
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,834
<i>Benedict!</i>

709
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,340
Benedict, help!

710
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,728
Your Majesty? Oh,
my God, Benedict.

711
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,947
Okay, untie me.

712
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,300
Sire, you said not to untie you.

713
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,414
No. No, no, no, no, no.

714
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,752
Please, come on. Okay, look.

715
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,417
I'm not trying to kill myself.

716
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,324
Poppy took the
key, and she is trying

717
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,760
to use it to get back to Earth.

718
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,627
Just... Okay, go
find her yourself.

719
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,327
Just whatever you do, do
not let her leave with that key.

720
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,561
Yes, Your Majesty.

721
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,735
God.

722
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,700
No! Stop!

723
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,656
Hey, did you get it?

724
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,021
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

725
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,758
I'm a terrible failure.

726
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,421
Okay. It's okay.

727
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,090
We'll get the key back somehow.

728
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,339
Benedict.

729
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,212
Hey, hey. Benedict.

730
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,143
Whoa, Benedict, no. Hey, listen.

731
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,982
Whatever it's telling
you to do, do not do it.

732
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,286
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,719
Benedict, no!

734
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,228
Mmm. Yummy.

735
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,731
Oh.

736
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,184
<i>Oh, as long as I
know how to love</i>

737
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,690
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

738
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,555
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

739
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,618
<i>I've got all my love to give</i>

740
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,392
<i>And I'll survive, hey, hey</i>

741
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,161
Penny, what's wrong?

742
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,168
Just saying goodbye. What?

743
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,161
Goodbye? Where are you going?

744
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,000
Just away.

745
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,437
Away... Wait.

746
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,600
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um, I don't understand.

747
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,122
Is this because of what
happened with Kady?

748
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,580
No. Okay.

749
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,958
Is it because we
did the transfer?

750
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,213
No. Look, I gotta go.

751
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,862
Wait, will you just talk
to me for a second?

752
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,253
You know what, we
barely know each other.

753
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,121
Don't suddenly act like you
care just 'cause I'm going.

754
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,717
I'm not acting.

755
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,104
I do care. I don't
want to see you go.

756
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,721
I don't want to see you give up.

757
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,958
Give up? Yeah.

758
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,366
You're the one who had
magic, and you gave it away.

759
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:01,071
What's your plan?
Go back to law school?

760
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,801
Live off your trust fund?

761
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,469
Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

762
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,944
and try to remember
what life was like

763
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,243
without a god or a quest.

764
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,943
Or some dead
asshole bothering me.

765
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,644
And, I don't know,
frankly beyond that,

766
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,947
it's none of your business.

767
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,784
'Cause you have
nothing beyond that.

768
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,621
Penny wants to say goodbye.

769
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,927
You're leaving? I
can't do this anymore.

770
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,404
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

771
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,847
Why don't I just
make you a new body?

772
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,515
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

773
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,896
A-plus job getting
rid of me, gorgeous.

774
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,839
Is this just a dream?

775
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,910
That time you fell out of
the tree when you were 12.

776
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,005
The bone in your arm
healed in six little weeks.

777
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,448
How come your fear
of heights never did?

778
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,289
I'm not the bone.

779
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,224
I'm the terror.

780
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,629
I do love how you keep trying.

781
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,123
And trying.

782
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,035
And trying. And trying.

783
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,179
I have not been punched

784
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,647
that hard since Burning Man.

785
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,446
Where is he? Where did he go?

786
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,917
Why does it smell like barbeque?

787
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,227
Benedict is dead, and
best-case scenario,

788
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,772
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

789
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,856
Um, Quentin. Don't talk to me.

790
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,900
Please, I mean it. Okay.

791
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,902
Just... Just one thing

792
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,646
and I swear I will
never talk to you again.

793
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,729
What?

794
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,774
Dragons don't shit.

795
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,832
Okay, great, fun fact. Thanks.

796
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,377
No one knows
exactly how it works,

797
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,073
but what they ingest
goes elsewhere.

798
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,774
They're gatekeepers, you know?

799
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,407
They don't just make portals.

800
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,849
They are portals.

801
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,649
So, actual best-case scenario...

802
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,617
The key went to the Underworld.

803
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:34,782
Mmm.

804
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,191
Oh, my God.

805
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,794
If you're here, I'm practicing

806
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,134
an Osseus Confervium.
Bone-knitting.

807
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,969
First step to
building a new body.

808
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:52,208
I know you can't
see me, but I'm here.

809
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,313
Thanks for giving
a shit about me.

810
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:01,980
Alice?

811
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,414
Alice, you okay? Alice?

812
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,220
God, Alice. Alice!

813
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,952
God, this is... Where's...

814
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,853
Alice!

815
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,032
Okay, okay, God. Come on.

816
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:24,206
Come on, someone's
got to hear this, please.

817
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,480
<i>Oh, as long as I
know how to love</i>

818
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,211
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

819
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,185
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

820
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:37,313
<i>I've got all my love to give</i>

821
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,187
<i>And I'll survive, hey, hey</i>

822
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,402
<i>It took all the strength
I had not to fall apart</i>

823
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:03,244
<i>Kept trying hard to mend
the pieces of my broken heart</i>
