1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:06,507
.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,475
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,244
- We found a key, too.

4
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,345
- The ghost said it
has the power

5
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,413
to reveal things
that are hidden.

6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,614
I'm a hidden thing.

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,083
- I'm Hyman.

8
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,417
When I first got stuck

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,319
in the Astral Plane,

10
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,688
I spent months trying
to push things.

11
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,090
I never got anywhere.

12
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,592
Until I tried being the thing.

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,427
Holy zerts!
You did it!

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,162
- The farmers are hesitant

15
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,231
because you're asking them
to throw out food

16
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,167
and replace it with, uh--
- Inedible mushrooms.

17
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,703
I got it.
I just need it done.

18
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,639
On Earth we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first.

19
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,576
- Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,312
- [gasps]

21
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,314
- It is my duty and honor

22
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,349
to take the place
of my late brother.

23
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,584
- Why do you have magic?
- I don't know.

24
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,286
- I'd do anything
to get it back.

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,488
- If I could give it
to you, I would.

26
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,490
- What if you could?

27
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,200
- Whoo. Sorry.

28
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,601
Okay.

29
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,607
- Last I checked,
we're looking for a spell,

30
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,309
not starting an eBay store.

31
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,446
- There's this old hedge story
I once heard

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,548
about some sort
of electrical transfer

33
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,152
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

34
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,587
People still talk about it.

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,256
Just look.

36
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,361
- So, you want us
to reverse engineer

37
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,596
a hedge witch urban legend
using kids' toys?

38
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,266
- I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

39
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,234
so unless you have
a better idea.

40
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,570
[toys clacking]

41
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,278
[muttering in Farsi]

42
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,358
Do you feel anything?

43
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,426
- No.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,728
Go again?

45
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,402
[plastic fish thrashing]
- * Oh, as long as I know

46
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,170
* How to love,
I know I'll stay alive *

47
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:18,272
- Why did that just
turn on by itself?

48
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,473
- Oh, my God.

49
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,708
- * I've got all my love
to give *

50
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,543
* And I'll survive

51
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,279
- [groans]
Give me your hand.

52
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,181
- Wait. Stop.

53
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,616
Do not do this.

54
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,518
- Did you just use
that fish as a doorbell?

55
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,253
- I've been trying to warn you
guys for, like, an hour.

56
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,621
"Being the fish button"
is the first thing

57
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,389
in this entire room
that's worked.

58
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:36,524
- What are you trying
to warn us about?

59
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:37,625
- This spell.

60
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,260
I've seen it in person.

61
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,628
- Are you serious?

62
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,663
- Yeah.

63
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,698
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

64
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,201
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

65
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,703
do the transfer,
and by the end of it,

66
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,705
everyone was on fire.

67
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,575
Trust me.
Fogg was right.

68
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,577
It's a bad idea.

69
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,748
- Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

70
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,750
- Aw, f--
- Fuck me.

71
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,552
You have magic.

72
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,819
And you're just now telling me?

73
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,456
- Don't take this
the wrong way,

74
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,724
but you've been
a little drunk.

75
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,227
And unreliable.
- Yes.

76
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:17,531
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely...reliable.

77
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,767
[books clattering]

78
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,803
- Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

79
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,273
- It wasn't Marina's spell.
It's mine.

80
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,342
She stole it from
my private collection.

81
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,644
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

82
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,247
on prohibited magic,
you would know

83
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,649
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

84
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,718
It is incredibly delicate.

85
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,653
- We--we know that, but--
- But what?

86
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,389
But you want to rid yourself

87
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,791
of the one thing we all
so desperately want?

88
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,694
- If you understood what--
- You understand.

89
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,796
I'm a Magician with no magic.

90
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,499
A dean without a school.

91
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,901
Just a blind, unemployed

92
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,770
black man in America.

93
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:02,343
Which, shockingly, was actually
being kept 38% more tolerant

94
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,911
through a series
of enchantments

95
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,480
which have now died.

96
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,616
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

97
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,551
in a position to need to.
- Okay, you're really drunk.

98
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,652
- [loudly] So what?

99
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,789
[quietly]
What does it matter?

100
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,758
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

101
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,493
than to attempt this.

102
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,295
You want to blow yourselves up?
Is that it?

103
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,630
[wheezes]

104
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,731
- [scoffs]

105
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,302
- Um. Just give me one second.

106
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,706
Okay.

107
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,475
[exhales slowly]

108
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,768
Uh, they'll hold
for a day or two,

109
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,670
but then Alice
can recharge them.

110
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,574
After we finish the transfer.

111
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,710
I know.
Everything is fucked.

112
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,346
I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

113
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,881
Julia.

114
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,584
- Yeah, well, it's not
not  my fault, either so.

115
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,620
- What you
two utter idiots need,

116
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,455
if you don't want to die,

117
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,457
is the flesh
of a magical creature

118
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,594
to act as a sort
of semiconductor.

119
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:30,398
A potent energy-drainer.
An incubus.

120
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,470
- If this is about the whole

121
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,771
marriage not being
consummated yet,

122
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,573
don't worry, it'll happen.

123
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,410
- Oh, no, no, no.
You misunderstand me, my dear.

124
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,778
You see, I've heard a rumor
about your advisor,

125
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,581
the Pickwick?
Sighted in a certain corridor.

126
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,383
Taking scrapings from the wall.

127
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,951
- He's just
a compulsive redecorator.

128
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,754
- You might be interested to
know that we both have been

129
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,490
plotting against
our mutual friend.

130
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,825
- Hmm.

131
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,794
No idea what
you're talking about.

132
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,397
- [exhales]
Margo.

133
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:04,765
You can trust me.

134
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,734
The misguided actions of my son

135
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,538
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

136
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,575
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

137
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,044
When the time is right,

138
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,680
we could use it to kill
the Fairy Queen.

139
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,555
- Hi.
- Oh, hell no.

140
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,022
Move.

141
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,659
- Hang your sheets out
the window afterwards, dear.

142
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,694
- Guards! Guards!

143
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,796
Don't even think about
closing it. No!

144
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,899
[screaming]
Guards!

145
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,901
[pounding]

146
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,969
Let me out!

147
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,674
[eerie music]

148
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:53,647
*

149
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,683
- I don't give a shit
if you have to find someone

150
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,050
to sell those shares short.

151
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,819
I need them today.

152
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,589
- [quietly] So the Incubus
is a hedge fund manager?

153
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,956
- Mm-hmm.
- Plus 5%.

154
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,958
And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

155
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,994
- Just remember what Fogg said.

156
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,563
Be respectful, no matter what.

157
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,931
- You got two minutes.

158
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,534
- Henry Fogg said
that you might be able

159
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,968
to help us power our spell.

160
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,872
Uh, we just--we need
to use your thing.

161
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,575
- My what?
- Uh, your--your thing.

162
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,977
Your--your business.

163
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,779
- Sorry?
- Uh.

164
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,550
Your little friend.
Uh, I mean--your big friend.

165
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,619
Well, I'm--I'm sure your friend

166
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,721
is perfectly proportioned
to your body.

167
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:37,758
I was just saying...
- Your penis.

168
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,595
Yep, we need to use your penis
to power our spell.

169
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,497
- And we know
that you need it too.

170
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,633
So that's why we'll build
the spell around it.

171
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,967
It'll be completely painless

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,702
and should only take
a couple minutes.

173
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,607
- [wheezing]

174
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,644
[laughing]

175
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,684
I can't believe
that actually worked!

176
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,686
- Wha--what actually worked?

177
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,589
- I planted this joke on Fogg
25 years ago.

178
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,824
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

179
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,893
- Wait, so you--
you don't have a magic--

180
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,161
- Of course not.

181
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,763
That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

182
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,631
I mean you're an incubus.

183
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,933
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

184
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,969
- Gods no.

185
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,771
I don't even like sex.

186
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,808
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

187
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,009
May I?

188
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,944
[sniffing]

189
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,546
[exhales loudly]

190
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,615
[sniffs, exhales]

191
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:38,085
[chuckles maniacally]
Oh, and you.

192
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,721
You got a lot of it,
I can tell.

193
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,056
[sniffs]

194
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,660
[exhales] Delish.

195
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,630
[sniffles] You give me
a few more hits of this,

196
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,898
and I'll give you something

197
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,100
that'll actually power
your spell.

198
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,810
- Is that your tail?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,645
Yeah, I grow
a new one every spring.

200
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,082
- Welcome back.

201
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,919
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

202
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,222
- You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

203
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,692
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

204
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,829
and unforeseen
seafaring...confusion.

205
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,899
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

206
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,701
of course--
- No, you won't.

207
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,170
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

208
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,041
The Stone Queen has locked
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

209
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,176
- Wait. What?
Why?

210
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,047
- She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

211
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,883
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

212
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,718
just as much
as the Floaters do.

213
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,620
- Listen, pro tip.

214
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,722
Let Margo out of there
immediately.

215
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,858
You know her.
Force isn't going to work.

216
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,061
- True. Force may not work.

217
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,064
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

218
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,732
- I am not going
to coerce Margo

219
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,701
into having sex
with a 15-year-old.

220
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,102
Have you never heard
of statutory rape?

221
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,238
- Fomar isn't a statue.
- That is not what--

222
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,874
Forget it.

223
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,710
- You will solve
this problem for me.

224
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,044
- And if I refuse?

225
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:18,151
- I've been searching
for a new keepsake.

226
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,087
Several bits will do.

227
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,890
- Fine, but I have
a feeling Queen Margo

228
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,225
is going to be
a little bit difficult.

229
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,060
[banging]

230
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,261
- I know!

231
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,163
You hate me
for killing Micah.

232
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,065
- [groans] Jesus Christ.

233
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,801
- It's just in our culture,

234
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,970
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

235
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,906
Most of us wind up

236
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,842
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

237
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,911
- Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

238
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,879
- No.

239
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,114
So, do you want
to take a break?

240
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,016
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

241
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,918
- Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

242
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,285
into a decorative,
whimsical planter?

243
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,022
- How are we supposed
to become one flesh

244
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,024
if you won't let me
touch you?

245
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,926
- We're not.
- But you're my wife.

246
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,694
- Oh, please.

247
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,195
You don't need a wife.

248
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,798
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

249
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:08,035
- What's a sex class?
Who--who's Ed?

250
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,803
- It's something they make you
do on Earth.

251
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,038
It makes you never wanna.

252
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,908
How about I show you?

253
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,083
Vaginas.

254
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,953
The leading cause
of death in men.

255
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,021
They spread disease.

256
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,157
They explode during childbirth.

257
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,959
[slaps book, turns page]

258
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:35,195
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

259
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,098
In fact, mine's doing it
right now.

260
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,001
- Well, that's okay.
I like blood.

261
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,173
- But do you like teeth?

262
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,278
- [sighs] Sorry I'm late.

263
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,113
You okay?

264
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,115
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

265
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,184
- This uniform is, like,
really sweaty.

266
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,252
- Yeah, I know, but it beats

267
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,188
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

268
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,891
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

269
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,126
Okay, key quest.
Hit me.

270
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,062
- Uh, okay,
so I'm pretty sure that

271
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,864
the fourth key is somewhere

272
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,866
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

273
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,135
Um, it's an uncharted
region of Fillory

274
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,872
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

275
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,409
Um, but, you know,
we get to go

276
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:26,947
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

277
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,017
- Uh, yeah.
I wish I could.

278
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,953
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

279
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,255
And I can't leave Margo.
- Right, of course.

280
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,290
- Sorry.
- No.

281
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,927
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

282
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,361
- Who wouldn't?

283
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,866
Uh, think about it.
You can take Benedict.

284
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,268
Go be life-partners with
someone else for a little bit.

285
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,805
But you'll be able to do the...
thing on the prow of a ship

286
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,240
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

287
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,309
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

288
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,982
[upbeat synth music]

289
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:09,022
*

290
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,060
- Whoo!

291
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,198
[imitates sword draw,
clanking]

292
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,935
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

293
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,009
[dice rattling]

294
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,077
[dice clatter]

295
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

296
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,498
Being on a mission is a hell
of an antidepressant.

297
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,066
You notice that, Benedict?

298
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,902
- Well, now that
you mention it.

299
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,338
- Whoa.

300
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,140
- We're entering
The Abyss, Sire.

301
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,146
It'll be darkness from here on.

302
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,184
- Thank you.

303
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,021
[ship creaks]

304
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,932
So how long
until we can keep going?

305
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,267
- As soon as we find safe
passage, your Majesty.

306
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,369
- Is someone out there?

307
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,138
Help!

308
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,143
Is someone out there?
Help!

309
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,183
- God, I think there's someone
out there on a raft.

310
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,920
[grunting]

311
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,424
- [sighs]
- You okay?

312
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,026
- Wow, wow, wow.

313
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,195
You just saved the shit
out of me.

314
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,330
[sighs] Poppy Kline.

315
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,100
Draconologist, postgraduate
fellow, and field researcher

316
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,135
at your service.

317
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,372
- Holy shit.
You're from Brakebills?

318
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:13,313
.

319
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,314
- So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

320
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,683
- Yeah.
- Shit.

321
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,086
I've stuck in The Abyss
way too long.

322
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,287
- How did you end up
out here anyway?

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,588
- Oh, I came with
some other students.

324
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,591
- Oh. Hey, sorry. I can,
um--uh.

325
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,260
- Spring Break,
Class of 2016?

326
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,495
Didn't turn out so well for us,

327
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,563
but that is
a whole nother story.

328
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,598
- Wait, sorry.

329
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,333
Do you know, um--
- [gasps]

330
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,734
If the next two words out
of your mouth are "Josh"

331
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,170
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

332
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,239
No way.
He's still alive?

333
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,408
- I mean, as far as I know.

334
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,176
- Oh, that's amazing.

335
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,744
- So how does
a Brakebills student

336
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,414
wind up alone on a raft?

337
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,350
- Get a girl a drink.
I'll tell you the whole story.

338
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,551
- [mutters] All right.

339
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,756
[ominous music]

340
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:04,131
*

341
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,234
- [clears throat]
Your Majesty.

342
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,402
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

343
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,204
- Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

344
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,439
- High Queen Margo let him go

345
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,740
as he was innocent
of all charges.

346
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,377
- Oh, right. Yeah.

347
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,611
Sorry about that.

348
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:28,288
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

349
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,191
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

350
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,393
An hour's ride North,
there is a forest

351
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,495
with naturally-occurring
aphrodisiacs

352
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,331
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

353
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,467
- [sighs]
Fine.

354
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,269
But if you fail--
- I know, I know.

355
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,537
New keepsakes.
Fingers, ears.

356
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,573
- Try your spleen.

357
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,541
- Okay.
- Go.

358
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,612
- Fieldwork was my thing at
Brakebills, and well, dragons.

359
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,281
[singsong]
Love them.

360
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,316
- Wait, so what happened
to your ship?

361
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,684
- Oh, wrecked.

362
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,419
Off the coast
of the Truthwaters.

363
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:02,289
I spent two years
on that little Picket.

364
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,792
And, bam. [snaps fingers]
Over in an instant.

365
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,261
That was three weeks ago.

366
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,798
- You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

367
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,701
- Yeah, it was rough.

368
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,369
Especially without magic.

369
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,604
Do you know anything
about why the hell

370
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,273
it just went out?
- I mean, um...

371
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,442
- I just hope
someone's fixing it.

372
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,612
- That someone is, um,
sort of me.

373
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:30,717
Um, I'm on a--a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

374
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,385
Right, so there's
seven of them.

375
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,522
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Golden keys?

376
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,789
Like...

377
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,662
- Holy shit. How did you--
- Short version?

378
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,431
Stole it.

379
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,599
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

380
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,269
just, like,
covered in treasure.

381
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,470
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

382
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,339
* Ah
Spontaneous orgasm.

383
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,574
I mean, places like this
are so rare.

384
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,343
There are only two
species of dragon

385
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,577
that even build
treasure-nests.

386
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,746
Anyway, this was
in one of them

387
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,614
with a bunch
of cool stuff.

388
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,384
But the thing that got me was

389
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,852
I could feel something
coming off it.

390
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,355
- Yeah.
- Even now.

391
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,258
It's somehow not dead, right?

392
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,626
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

393
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,628
so I just took it.

394
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,430
- Just like that?

395
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,532
- I'm a person
of questionable ethics.

396
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,335
[chuckles]
Here.

397
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,639
It's yours, from one quester
to another.

398
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,643
- Wow. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,711
- So do you know what it does?

400
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,712
I mean, each one sort of

401
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,347
has a unique thing.

402
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,383
- I don't know.

403
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,552
Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

404
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,589
Uh, here's to that.

405
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,891
[both laughing]

406
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,397
[sighs]

407
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,432
You wanna? Yeah.
- Oh.

408
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,305
- Okay.
Well, here goes nothing.

409
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:05,345
- [sighs]
- [speaking in Farsi]

410
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,814
- Ugh, man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

411
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,716
You're gonna kill yourselves!

412
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,420
Oh, my God. I can't--
- Golly Moses.

413
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,388
You're right.
They're gonna kill themselves.

414
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,657
- Don't you have some shower
to go haunt?

415
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,759
- Oh, no one's showering
right now.

416
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,828
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

417
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,963
- Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

418
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,699
- Ah, just a bit zozzled,
I think.

419
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,836
He was quite naked.
[chuckles]

420
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,739
Remarkably...
well-preserved.

421
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,743
Guess it's possible
to age gracefully.

422
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,977
- Oh, my God.

423
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,547
Fuck, man.
I can't watch this.

424
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,982
- See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

425
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,884
You act like you don't care,

426
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,720
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

427
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,789
- Yeah, then--then why
is everyone acting

428
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,758
like I'm not a part
of it anymore?

429
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:56,396
- Maybe it's time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

430
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,864
- You mean, leave?
- Why not?

431
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,766
Go--go find a story
to watch

432
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,634
that doesn't make you
so depressed.

433
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,704
- [gasping]
- Oh, I think they did it.

434
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,506
[inhales loudly]

435
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,513
- I'm having a good time.

436
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,647
Mm.

437
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,717
[murmuring]

438
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,852
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close--

439
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:45,345
.

440
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,979
- Rise and shine, princess.

441
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,283
- [stammering] Who?

442
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,319
- The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

443
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,321
to black out after,
what, five drinks?

444
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,955
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

445
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,857
- I don't...

446
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,493
Okay. Uh...

447
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:04,030
Um...
[stammering]

448
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,865
- Seriously.

449
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,568
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

450
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,471
[sighs]

451
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,907
- Sorry, um, can you--are
you--are you seeing this?

452
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,778
- Nobody cares, dude.

453
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,348
They all have actual jobs,
unlike you.

454
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,015
- Right, okay.

455
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,784
No problem.

456
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,559
- What the fuck did you do?
- Okay, I can explain.

457
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,561
- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

458
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,863
It's all right.
- There's another me.

459
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,031
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

460
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,867
Nothing about this
is all right.

461
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,002
- Okay, listen.
Here's the deal.

462
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,372
The key does have a power.
- No shit.

463
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,906
- It takes the darkest
parts of you

464
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:50,042
and makes a...kind of--
well, you met it.

465
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:53,480
It's kind of like
a depression monster?

466
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:57,350
Looks like you,
talks like you.

467
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:00,420
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

468
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,455
Unless...
- Unless?

469
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,890
- Unless it gets in your head

470
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,057
and convinces you
to hurt yourself.

471
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,926
- Well--
- But you'll be fine.

472
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,928
It only affects the last person
who touched the key.

473
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,963
So just pass it along
to someone else.

474
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,066
That's what we did.
- Who's we?

475
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,468
- My former shipmates.

476
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,869
After I stole the key,

477
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,405
we passed it
from person to person

478
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,140
until we, you know,
ran out of options.

479
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,543
- What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

480
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:26,613
- Um. Hit an iceberg?

481
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,415
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

482
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,583
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

483
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,385
You have to be, like,
a badass about it,

484
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,120
and what can I say?

485
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,988
They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

486
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,091
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

487
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,561
- Eh. Maybe, like, half?

488
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,596
- This key made half
of your shipmates

489
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,965
kill themselves,
and you gave it to me?

490
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,900
- Yeah. [chuckles]
But don't worry.

491
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,068
They were all pretty

492
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,970
psychologically damaged
already.

493
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,039
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

494
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,108
- Mmmm, no. No, no.

495
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,445
I'm not. This is like...
[stammering]

496
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,879
It's like we're
on a boat, okay?

497
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,548
This is not how I usually am.

498
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,416
- You're usually
a wet blanket, self-pitying,

499
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,584
party pooping dickwad.

500
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,586
- Shut up!

501
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,888
- You better pass
that along fast.

502
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,458
- What? No!
Not if there is a 50%

503
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,959
chance of it killing
the next person.

504
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,994
[stammering]

505
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,464
Okay.

506
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,999
Right, yep.
I'll just hold on to it.

507
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,068
Until we get back
to Whitespire.

508
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,136
I can do that.
- Your choice.

509
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,738
I mean, we're stuck
in The Abyss

510
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,973
till we found our way out.

511
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:27,974
It could be days.

512
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,742
It could be weeks.

513
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,911
Oh, but hey.
Don't stress.

514
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,547
You might be fine.
- You won't be.

515
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,483
- You know what?

516
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,486
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

517
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,754
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

518
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,456
that I've got a black belt.

519
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,924
So come at me.

520
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,930
- The problem is your hair.

521
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,532
I know you're just trying
to hide your face,

522
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,634
but it really
only makes it worse.

523
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,168
Seriously,
have you ever noticed

524
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,770
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

525
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,506
If feet had frown lines?

526
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,541
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

527
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,511
which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

528
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:07,079
Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

529
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,049
And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

530
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,684
a senile frowny foot-face.

531
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,086
- Jesus. Fuck.

532
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,158
- This is pointless.
You can't run me off.

533
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,529
You can't eat me off.

534
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,665
You can't drink me off.

535
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,602
You can't jerk me off.

536
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,003
God, you're so vulgar.

537
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,706
We had a thing going,
and you--you made it

538
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,608
unnecessarily gross.

539
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,211
You sick of the shallow,
petty stuff?

540
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,681
I get it.

541
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,616
The thing is,
I start on the outside,

542
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,785
and I work my way
into the core.

543
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,522
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

544
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,790
when you could have helped her,

545
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,126
that is what set her
on that path.

546
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,565
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

547
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,266
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

548
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,101
You ruined her.

549
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,737
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

550
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,273
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

551
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:11,310
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

552
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,112
- Just stop!

553
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,548
- You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

554
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,084
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

555
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,119
But you are never
gonna feel okay.

556
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,822
- No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

557
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,290
- Quentin.

558
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,760
I am your head.

559
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,763
You know I'm right
because I am you.

560
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:40,339
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

561
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,742
- Fomar.

562
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,276
Bottoms up.

563
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:49,716
- Uh, in my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

564
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,150
- Drink the wine, Margo.

565
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,852
- I don't wanna drink
the wine.

566
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,187
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

567
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,056
- You'll feel better
if you just

568
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,059
drink the wine, Margo.

569
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,770
- [coughing]

570
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,173
So, um...

571
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,676
Do we have sex in the carriage?

572
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,311
Or do we have sex outside?

573
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,616
Or do--
- I'm not having sex with you.

574
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,086
You psychotic fetus.

575
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,655
Ever.

576
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,898
Either I just killed him
with my rage

577
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,332
or you drugged his wine.

578
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,201
- And to think...
[sighs]

579
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,603
You doubted me.
- To think.

580
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:50,142
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

581
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,278
- Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

582
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,814
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

583
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,749
than sleeping beauty over here.

584
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,885
The fairies are up to something
in the Northern Orchards.

585
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,853
They evacuated
the villagers weeks ago

586
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:03,122
and haven't let
another human in since.

587
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,358
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

588
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,427
and he saw some crazy shit.

589
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,963
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

590
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,933
mutant plant life,
Chernobyl-level shit.

591
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,936
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

592
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,439
- Great, well, now
I can't be mad at you.

593
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,141
Thanks.

594
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,143
- I know,
I wanted to fight, too,

595
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,245
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

596
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,848
we could just--
- Be us again?

597
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,850
Who are we now, El?

598
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,251
We used to be
glamorous,

599
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,954
amazing mega-bitches.

600
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,455
And now?

601
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,893
- We have depth and character.

602
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,930
Let's decide--
we'll find us again

603
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,265
once we're done
saving Fillory.

604
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,700
Okay?

605
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,337
Duty calls.

606
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,305
Let's go see
about these orchards.

607
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,680
Which are...

608
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:13,793
.

609
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:14,460
- Nothing is going to save you.

610
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,029
Not Brakebills.

611
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:20,032
Not Fillory.
Not a quest.

612
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,869
Just do it.

613
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,871
Kill yourself.

614
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,439
Make it stop.

615
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,809
You know the way out.

616
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,021
- King Quentin, no!

617
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,156
- Oh, no, I wasn't.
I was just--

618
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,925
I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

619
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,394
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

620
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,930
I thought about it too.

621
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:54,333
Though I've never spoken
about it, of course.

622
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,168
- Why not?

623
00:28:56,202 --> 00:29:00,206
- Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

624
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:05,211
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

625
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:09,048
and turn them into, um,
maps, for example.

626
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,217
- Jesus, Benedict.

627
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,085
Okay, we should talk
about this.

628
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,087
- If it please you, Sire,
but first,

629
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,189
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

630
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:23,863
- Yeah. I don't really trust
myself right now.

631
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:28,334
- You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

632
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,002
the crew would tie them
to the mast.

633
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:32,004
[laughs]
Isn't that funny?

634
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:33,472
- Oh, my God.
Tie me to the mast.

635
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,107
- [laughs]

636
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:40,112
No--no, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

637
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,882
Okay, swear to me,
no matter what I say,

638
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,953
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

639
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:50,256
- Very well.
I won't.

640
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,024
- Thank you.

641
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,387
- It worked.

642
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,025
- Thank you.

643
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,194
[both laugh]

644
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:19,211
- Oh. I see
the transfer worked.

645
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,348
- It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

646
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,583
- I hope you'll be careful.

647
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,486
- I will be.

648
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,490
- You know that fixing
my glasses

649
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,625
won't fix me.

650
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,561
- Yeah, but they make
all of this

651
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,164
one speck less shitty.
[taps desk]

652
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,304
- [groans]

653
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,339
It smells like the fairy realm.

654
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,509
- We're so far North.

655
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,412
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

656
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,115
- Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

657
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,518
All that spritzing
and bathing.

658
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,088
You know, it's--it's like
they're afraid

659
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,024
to dry out in Fillory
or something.

660
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,128
- Oh, my God.

661
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,365
- The fuckers are terraforming.

662
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,168
- They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

663
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,669
That is not okay.
- No.

664
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,338
Definitely not.

665
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,143
That mushroom just moved.

666
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,312
- Really?
- Should I pluck it?

667
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,249
I'm--I'm gonna do it.

668
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,051
- Mm. Margo, don't.

669
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,526
- [gasps]
- Oh.

670
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:45,097
- [groans]
- Uh.

671
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,333
- It's a fairy embryo.

672
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,602
- Really?
- These are eggs, El.

673
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,238
- I mean, really?

674
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,140
- The fairies aren't
just terraforming.

675
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,275
They're growing an army.

676
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:00,179
.

677
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,380
- I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

678
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,251
I mean, think about
all the crazy shit

679
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,019
they've kept us busy with.

680
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,522
Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

681
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,459
This is all just
a thin frosting of whimsy

682
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,562
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

683
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,032
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

684
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,568
We need a plan bigger than just
assassinating the Queen.

685
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,172
We need--we need--we
need--we need--we need...

686
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:29,141
We need...Margo?

687
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,212
Margo?
- [panting]

688
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,114
Kidnapping. Hostages.
Leverage.

689
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,716
Don't ask questions, go! Go!
- What the fuck?

690
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,052
- Go, go!

691
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,797
- It's a bitch, right?

692
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,832
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

693
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,601
Have you tried distracting it?

694
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,570
For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

695
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,239
Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

696
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,074
- Please, fuck off.

697
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,510
- Look, I'm sorry
I passed you the key.

698
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,844
I really thought
you could handle it.

699
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,746
- This is me handling it.

700
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,749
- No, no, you're right.

701
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,185
I wish we'd thought of tying
ourselves up.

702
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,521
That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

703
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,356
That killed
three of us off quick.

704
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,191
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

705
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,227
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

706
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,162
Others, it takes time
to wear down.

707
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,100
You want me to take
the key for a while?

708
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,301
Give you some relief?

709
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,703
- No.

710
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,273
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

711
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,642
And I need it.

712
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,677
For the quest.
- Fine.

713
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,812
Be a suffer-martyr.

714
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,648
- Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

715
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,683
They help sometimes, too.

716
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,853
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

717
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,388
- Keyholes, like...

718
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,125
- Like in the walls
or clocks.

719
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,261
Don't ask me how it works.
- [stammering]

720
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,629
So--so where
do the keyholes go?

721
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:01,300
- To Earth or the Neitherlands
or wherever.

722
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,602
- Wait, wait.
Are you serious?

723
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,742
- Stop it.
What are you doing?

724
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,178
- I've been stuck here in
Fillory this whole time

725
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,412
when I could have gone home?

726
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,148
- Hey.
No, Poppy, stop it.

727
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,684
Poppy, no.
Stop.

728
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,153
Poppy!

729
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,289
- I told you
you should've killed yourself.

730
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,790
- [sighs]

731
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,859
- Okay.

732
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:33,799
Okay, we just have one
outstanding problem.

733
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,367
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

734
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,669
- Don't worry.
I got this.

735
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:46,712
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

736
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,881
- They've got three eyes?
- No, baby.

737
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,783
They've got fangs.

738
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,422
- [moaning]

739
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,324
[groans softly]

740
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:01,260
Oh! Oh, something bit
my manhood.

741
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,329
- Congratulations, son.
You just had sex.

742
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,231
The first time's
always painful.

743
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,433
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

744
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:11,203
But, hey, you were amazing.

745
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,339
What?

746
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,940
I like to watch.

747
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,877
- Wanna go again?

748
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,213
Hmm?

749
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,215
- Benedict!

750
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:26,218
[dramatic music]

751
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:28,720
Benedict, help!

752
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:29,988
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my God, Benedict.

753
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,390
Okay, untie me.

754
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,658
- Sire, you said not
to untie you.

755
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,759
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

756
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,227
Please, come on.
Okay, look.

757
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:36,762
I'm not trying to kill myself.

758
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,697
Poppy took the key,
and she is trying

759
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,232
to use it to get back to Earth.

760
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,933
Just--okay, go find
her yourself.

761
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,703
Just whatever you do, do not
let her leave with that key.

762
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,871
- Yes, Your Majesty.

763
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,207
- God.

764
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,012
- No! Stop!

765
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,915
[grunting]

766
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:58,817
- [groans]

767
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,427
- Hey, did you get it?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

768
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,464
I'm a terrible failure.

769
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,766
- Okay. It's okay.

770
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,703
We'll get the key back somehow.

771
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,978
Benedict.

772
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,784
Hey, hey. Benedict.

773
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,553
Whoa, Benedict, no.
Hey, listen.

774
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,357
Whatever it's telling you
to do, do not do it.

775
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,759
- I'm sorry.

776
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,993
- Benedict, no!

777
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,741
- Mm. Yummy.

778
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:03,582
.

779
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,884
- [humming]

780
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:09,688
- * Oh, as long as I know
how to love *

781
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,957
[fish thrashing]

782
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,559
* I know I'll stay alive

783
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,461
* I've got all my life
to live *

784
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,529
* I've got all my love
to give *

785
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:21,333
* And I'll survive,
hey, hey *

786
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,934
- Penny, what's wrong?

787
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,970
- Just saying goodbye.
- What?

788
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,573
Goodbye?
Where are you going?

789
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:28,840
- Just away.

790
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,876
- Away--wait.

791
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,480
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um. I don't understand.

792
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,847
Is this because
of what happened with Kady?

793
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,449
- No.
- Okay.

794
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,717
Is it because we did
the transfer?

795
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,952
- No. Look, I gotta go.

796
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,654
- Wait, will you just
talk to me for a second?

797
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,990
- You know what,
we barely know each other.

798
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,893
Don't suddenly act like
you care just 'cause I'm going.

799
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,561
- I'm not acting.

800
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:50,829
I do care.
I don't want to see you go.

801
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,564
I don't want
to see you give up.

802
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:54,766
- Give up?
- Yeah.

803
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,904
- You're the one who had magic,
and you gave it away.

804
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,840
What's your plan?
Go back to law school?

805
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,642
Live off your trust fund?

806
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,378
- Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

807
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,747
and try to remember
what life was like

808
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,982
without a god or a quest.

809
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,751
Or some dead asshole
bothering me.

810
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,520
And, I don't know,
frankly beyond that,

811
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:15,754
it's none
of your business.

812
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,624
- 'Cause you have nothing
beyond that.

813
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:19,791
[door shuts]

814
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,660
[footsteps approaching]

815
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,798
- Penny wants to say goodbye.

816
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:32,771
- You're leaving?
- I can't do this anymore.

817
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:36,642
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

818
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,782
- Why don't I just
make you a new body?

819
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,617
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

820
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,571
- [gasps]
- A-plus job

821
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:08,073
getting rid of me,
gorgeous.

822
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,742
- Is this just a dream?

823
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,745
- That time you fell out
of a tree when you were 12.

824
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:17,816
The bone in your arm healed
in six little weeks.

825
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,519
How come your fear
of heights never did?

826
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:27,526
I'm not the bone.

827
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,762
I'm the terror.

828
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,467
I do love how you keep trying.

829
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,969
And trying.

830
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:41,840
And trying.
And trying.

831
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,575
- [gasps]

832
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,948
- [groans]
I have not been punched

833
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,517
that hard since
Burning Man.

834
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,520
Where is he?
Where did he go?

835
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,723
Why does it smell
like barbeque?

836
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,995
- Benedict is dead,
and best-case-scenario,

837
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,597
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

838
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,699
- Um, Quentin.
- Don't talk to me.

839
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:09,735
Please, I mean it.
- Okay.

840
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,737
Just-- [clears throat]
Just one thing

841
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,505
and I swear I will never
talk to you again.

842
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,606
- What?

843
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,642
- Dragons don't shit.

844
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,677
- Okay, great, fun fact.
Thanks.

845
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,111
- No one knows exactly
how it works,

846
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,881
but what they ingest
goes elsewhere.

847
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,650
They're gatekeepers, you know?

848
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,151
They don't just make portals.

849
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,153
They are portals.

850
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,757
So, actual
best-case-scenario...

851
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,626
- The key went
to the Underworld.

852
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,962
- Mm.
- Oh, my God.

853
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,671
- If you're here,
I'm practicing

854
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,939
an Osseus Confervium.
Bone-knitting.

855
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,808
First step to building
a new body.

856
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:54,646
- I know you can't see me,
but I'm here.

857
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,047
Thanks for giving a shit
about me.

858
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,821
Alice?

859
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,055
- [shaky breathing]

860
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,191
- Alice, you okay?
Alice?

861
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,127
God, Alice.
Alice!

862
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,631
God, this is--where's...

863
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,099
Alice!

864
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,568
[panting]

865
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:21,673
Okay, okay, God.
Come on.

866
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:24,976
Come on, someone's got
to hear this, please.

867
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:32,217
- * Oh, as long as I know
how to love *

868
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,019
* I know I'll stay alive

869
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,987
* I've got all my life
to live *

870
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,089
* I've got all my love
to give *

871
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,959
* And I'll survive,
hey, hey *

872
00:42:56,675 --> 00:43:00,178
* It took all the strength
I had not to fall apart *

873
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:04,082
* Kept trying hard to mend the
pieces of my broken heart *
