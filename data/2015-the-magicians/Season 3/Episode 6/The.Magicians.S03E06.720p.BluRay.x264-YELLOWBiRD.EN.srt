1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,617
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,952
<i>We found a key, too.</i>

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,163
The ghost said it has the power

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,442
to reveal things
that are hidden.

5
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,627
I'm a hidden thing.

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,958
I'm Hyman.

7
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,384
When I first got stuck

8
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,257
in the astral plane,

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,714
I spent months
trying to push things.

10
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,968
I never got anywhere.

11
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,392
Until I tried being the thing.

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,393
Holy zerts! You did it!

13
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,058
The farmers are hesitant

14
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,140
because you're asking them
to throw out food

15
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,068
- and replace it with, uh...
- Inedible mushrooms.

16
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,736
I got it. I just need it done.

17
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,648
<i>On Earth we tend to meet the people
we're gonna marry first.</i>

18
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,485
<i>Surely you've heard of
the Tribe of The Floating Mountain.</i>

19
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,243
It is my duty and honor

20
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,290
to take the place
of my late brother.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,542
<i>- Why do you have magic?
- I don't know.</i>

22
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,162
I'd do anything to get it back.

23
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,459
If I could give it to you,
I would.

24
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,298
What if you could?

25
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,967
Whoo. Sorry.

26
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,597
Okay.

27
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,604
Last I checked,
we're looking for a spell,

28
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,230
not starting an eBay store.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,404
There's this old hedge story
I once heard

30
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,527
about some sort
of electrical transfer

31
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,031
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

32
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,532
People still talk about it.

33
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,201
Just look.

34
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,290
So, you want us
to reverse engineer

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,793
a hedge witch urban legend
using kids' toys?

36
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,169
I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,126
so unless you have
a better idea...

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,275
Do you feel anything?

39
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,405
No.

40
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,787
Go again?

41
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,331
<i>Oh, as long as I know.</i>

42
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,037
<i>How to love
I know I'll stay alive.</i>

43
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,043
Why did that just turn on
by itself?

44
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,294
Oh, my God.

45
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,716
<i>I've got all my love to give.</i>

46
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,213
<i>And I'll survive.</i>

47
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,720
Give me your hand.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,802
Wait. Stop.

49
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,553
Do not do this.

50
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,535
Did you just use
that fish as a doorbell?

51
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,206
I've been trying to warn you
guys for, like, an hour.

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,190
Being the fish button is the first thing
in this entire room that's worked.

53
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,461
What are you trying
to warn us about?

54
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,485
This spell.

55
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,144
I've seen it in person.

56
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,398
Are you serious?

57
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,113
Yeah.

58
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,698
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

59
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,777
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,700
do the transfer,
and by the end of it,

61
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,747
everyone was on fire.

62
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,541
Trust me. Fogg was right.

63
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,585
It's a bad idea.

64
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,381
Wait a minute.
Did you just say Fogg was right?

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,550
Oh...

66
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,751
Fuck me.

67
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,380
You have magic.

68
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,837
And you're just now telling me?

69
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,389
Don't take this the wrong way,

70
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,717
but you've been a little drunk.

71
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,928
- And unreliable.
- Yes.

72
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,478
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely reliable.

73
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,945
Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

74
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,152
It wasn't Marina's spell.
It's mine.

75
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,450
She stole it from
my private collection.

76
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,615
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

77
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,119
on prohibited magic,
you would know

78
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,621
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

79
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,703
It is incredibly delicate.

80
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,628
- We know that, but...
- But what?

81
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,297
But you want to rid yourself

82
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,796
of the one thing
we all so desperately want?

83
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,217
If you understood what...

84
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,303
You understand.

85
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,796
I'm a Magician with no magic.

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,432
A dean without a school.

87
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,935
Just a blind, unemployed

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,182
black man in America.

89
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:57,235
Which, shockingly,
was actually being kept 38% more tolerant

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,403
through a series of enchantments

91
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,401
which have now died.

92
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,651
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

93
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,638
- in a position to need to.
- Okay, you're really drunk.

94
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,662
So what?

95
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,289
What does it matter?

96
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,783
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

97
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,460
than to attempt this.

98
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,959
- You want to blow yourselves up?
- Is that it?

99
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,257
Um... Just give me one second.

100
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,340
Okay.

101
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,793
Uh, they'll hold
for a day or two,

102
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,711
but then Alice
can recharge them.

103
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,207
After we finish the transfer.

104
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,423
I know. Everything is fucked.

105
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,263
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

106
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,924
Julia.

107
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,555
Yeah, well, it's not
not my fault either, so...

108
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,604
What you two utter idiots need,

109
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,021
if you don't want to die,

110
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,399
is the flesh
of a magical creature

111
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,569
to act as a sort of
semiconductor.

112
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,365
A potent energy-drainer.
An incubus.

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,412
If this is about the whole

114
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,850
marriage not being
consummated yet,

115
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,866
don't worry, it'll happen.

116
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,118
Oh, no, no, no.
You misunderstand me, my dear.

117
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,708
See, I've heard a rumor
about your adviser,

118
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,544
the Pickwick?
Sighted in a certain corridor,

119
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,296
taking scrapings from the wall.

120
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,173
He's just a compulsive
redecorator.

121
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,759
You might be interested to
know that we both have been

122
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,432
plotting against
our mutual friend.

123
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,801
Hmm.

124
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,553
No idea what
you're talking about.

125
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,230
Margo.

126
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,766
You can trust me.

127
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,726
The misguided actions of my son

128
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,484
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

129
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,568
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

130
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,115
When the time is right,

131
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,697
we could use it to kill
the Fairy Queen.

132
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,292
- Hi.
- Oh, hell, no.

133
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,082
Move.

134
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,633
Hang your sheets out
the window afterwards, dear.

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,677
Guards! Guards!

136
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't even think about
closing it. No!

137
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,133
Guards!

138
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,057
Let me out!

139
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,657
I don't give a shit
if you have to find someone

140
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,110
to sell those shares short.

141
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,865
I need them today.

142
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,531
So the incubus
is a hedge fund manager?

143
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,994
Plus 5%.

144
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,996
And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

145
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,702
Just remember what Fogg said.

146
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,879
Be respectful, no matter what.

147
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,877
You got two minutes.

148
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,464
Henry Fogg said
that you might be able

149
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,010
to help us power our spell.

150
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,756
Uh... We just... We need
to use your thing.

151
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,513
- My what?
- Your... Your thing.

152
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,765
Your... Your business.

153
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,437
Sorry?

154
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,645
Your little friend.
Uh, I mean... Your big friend.

155
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,561
Well, I'm sure your friend

156
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,692
is perfectly proportioned
to your body.

157
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,071
- I was just saying...
- Your penis.

158
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,537
Yep, we need to use your penis
to power our spell.

159
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,410
And we know that
you need it too.

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,583
So that's why we'll build
the spell around it.

161
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,001
It'll be completely painless

162
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,703
and should only take
a couple minutes.

163
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,634
I can't believe
that actually worked!

164
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,640
Wha... What actually worked?

165
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,522
I planted this joke on Fogg
25 years ago.

166
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,816
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

167
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,894
Wait, so you...
You don't have a magic...

168
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,149
Of course not.

169
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,733
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

170
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,565
I mean, you're an incubus.

171
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,946
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

172
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,861
Gods no.

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,742
I don't even like sex.

174
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,792
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

175
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,038
May I?

176
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,131
Oh, and you.

177
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,679
You got a lot of it, I can tell.

178
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,268
Delish.

179
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,560
You give me
a few more hits of this,

180
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,890
and I'll give you something

181
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,192
that'll actually
power your spell.

182
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,784
- Is that your tail?
- Yeah.

183
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,612
Yeah, I grow
a new one every spring.

184
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,117
Welcome back.

185
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,918
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

186
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,294
You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

187
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,626
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,838
and unforeseen
seafaring confusion.

189
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,953
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

190
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,639
- of course...
- No, you won't.

191
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,142
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

192
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,147
The Stone Queen has locked.

193
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,065
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

194
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,230
Wait. What? Why?

195
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,064
She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

196
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,866
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

197
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,659
just as much as the Floaters do.

198
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,445
Listen, pro tip.

199
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,660
Let Margo
out of there immediately.

200
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,833
You know her.
Force isn't going to work.

201
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,878
True. Force may not work.

202
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,085
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

203
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,666
I am not going to coerce Margo

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,626
into having sex
with a 15-year-old.

205
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,336
Have you never heard
of statutory rape?

206
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,298
- Fomar isn't a statue.
- That is not what...

207
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,181
- Forget it.
- You will solve this problem for me.

208
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,102
And if I refuse?

209
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,314
I've been searching
for a new keepsake.

210
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,112
Several bits will do.

211
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,316
Fine, but I have
a feeling Queen Margo

212
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,317
is going to be
a little bit difficult.

213
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,324
I know!

214
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,201
You hate me for killing Micah.

215
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,078
Oh, Jesus Christ.

216
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,746
It's just, in our culture,

217
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,955
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

218
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,880
Most of us wind up

219
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,801
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

220
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,878
Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

221
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,097
No.

222
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,212
So, do you want to take a break?

223
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,970
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

224
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,955
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

225
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,414
into a decorative,
whimsical planter?

226
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,021
How are we supposed
to become one flesh

227
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,020
if you won't let me touch you?

228
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,900
- We're not.
- But you're my wife.

229
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,486
Oh, please.

230
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,112
You don't need a wife.

231
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,073
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

232
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,278
What's a sex class? Who's Ed?

233
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,807
It's something they make you
do on Earth.

234
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,072
It makes you never wanna.

235
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,958
How about I show you?

236
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,084
Vaginas.

237
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,591
The leading cause
of death in men.

238
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,672
They spread disease.

239
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,887
They explode during childbirth.

240
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,229
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

241
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,435
In fact, mine's doing it
right now.

242
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,027
Well, that's okay. I like blood.

243
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,031
But do you like teeth?

244
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,161
Sorry I'm late.

245
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,575
You okay?

246
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,128
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

247
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,202
This uniform is, like,
really sweaty.

248
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,287
Yeah, I know, but it beats

249
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,212
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

250
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,336
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

251
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,085
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

252
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,013
Uh, okay, so
I'm pretty sure that

253
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,802
the fourth key is somewhere

254
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,384
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

255
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,390
Um, it's an uncharted
region of Fillory

256
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,810
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

257
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,023
Um...

258
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,476
But, you know, we get to go

259
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,905
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

260
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,779
Yeah. I wish I could.

261
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,912
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

262
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,284
- And I can't leave Margo.
- Right, of course.

263
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,332
- Sorry.
- No.

264
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,876
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

265
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,499
Who wouldn't?

266
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,833
Think about it.
You can take Benedict.

267
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,379
Go be life partners with
someone else for a little bit.

268
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,763
But you'll be able to do the...
Thing on the prow of a ship

269
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,369
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

270
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,431
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

271
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,902
Whoo!

272
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,960
Sorry. Sorry.

273
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,138
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

274
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,615
Being on a mission is
a hell of an antidepressant.

275
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,067
You notice that, Benedict?

276
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,902
Well, now that you mention it.

277
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,409
Whoa.

278
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,206
We're entering The Abyss, Sire.

279
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,213
It'll be darkness from here on.

280
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,256
Thank you.

281
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,898
So how long
until we can keep going?

282
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,317
As soon as we find
safe passage, Your Majesty.

283
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,440
Is someone out there?

284
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,192
Help!

285
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,194
Is someone out there? Help!

286
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,242
God, I think there's someone
out there on a raft.

287
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,046
You okay?

288
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,096
Wow, wow, wow. You just saved
the shit out of me.

289
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,556
Poppy Kline.

290
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,100
Draconologist, postgraduate fellow,
and field researcher

291
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,427
at your service.

292
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,473
Holy shit.
You're from Brakebills?

293
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,941
Yeah.

294
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,737
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

295
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,864
- Yeah.
- Shit.

296
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,911
I've been stuck in The Abyss
way too long.

297
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,225
How did you end up
out here anyway?

298
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,535
I came with some other students.

299
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,538
Oh, hey, sorry. I can... Uh...

300
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,870
Spring Break, Class of 2016?

301
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,454
Didn't turn out so well for us,

302
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,248
but that is a whole
'nother story.

303
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,801
Wait, sorry.

304
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,213
Do you know, um...

305
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,781
If the next two words
out of your mouth are "Josh"

306
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,013
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

307
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,091
No way. He's still alive?

308
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,643
I mean, as far as I know.

309
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,014
Oh, that's amazing.

310
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,721
So how does a Brakebills student

311
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,057
wind up alone on a raft?

312
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,235
Get a girl a drink.
I'll tell you the whole story.

313
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,527
All right.

314
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,081
Your Majesty.

315
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,288
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

316
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,043
Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

317
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,340
High Queen Margo let him go

318
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,746
as he was innocent
of all charges.

319
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,918
Oh, right. Yeah.

320
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,588
Sorry about that.

321
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:24,144
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

322
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,021
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

323
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,270
An hour's ride north,
there is a forest

324
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,400
with naturally-occurring
aphrodisiacs

325
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,199
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

326
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,197
Fine.

327
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,116
- But if you fail...
- I know, I know.

328
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,493
New keepsakes. Fingers, ears.

329
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,495
Try your spleen.

330
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,497
- Okay.
- Go.

331
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,543
Fieldwork was my thing at Brakebills,
and well, dragons.

332
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,124
Love them.

333
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,050
Wait, so what happened
to your ship?

334
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,044
Oh. Wrecked.

335
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,365
Off the coast
of the Truthwaters.

336
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,132
I spent two years
on that little picket.

337
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,014
And, bam. Over in an instant.

338
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,436
That was three weeks ago.

339
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,774
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

340
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,817
Yeah, it was rough.

341
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,233
Especially without magic.

342
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,592
Do you know anything
about why the hell

343
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,108
- it just went out?
- I mean...

344
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,319
I just hope someone's fixing it.

345
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,120
That someone is, um, sort of me.

346
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,786
I'm on a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

347
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,245
Right, so there's seven of them.

348
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,207
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Golden keys?

349
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,795
Like...

350
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,505
Holy shit. How did you...

351
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,598
Short version?

352
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,052
Stole it.

353
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,510
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

354
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,095
just, like, covered in treasure.

355
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,708
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

356
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,189
Ah. Spontaneous orgasm.

357
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,480
I mean, places like this
are so rare.

358
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,186
There are only
two species of dragon

359
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
that even build treasure-nests.

360
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,690
Anyway, this was in one of them

361
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,524
with a bunch of cool stuff.

362
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,235
But the thing that got me was

363
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,820
I could feel something
coming off it.

364
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,201
- Yeah.
- Even now.

365
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,409
It's somehow not dead, right?

366
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,536
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

367
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,212
so I just took it.

368
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,043
Just like that?

369
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,252
I'm a person of questionable ethics.

370
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,215
Here.

371
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,591
It's yours,
from one quester to another.

372
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,723
Wow. Thank you.

373
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,708
So do you know what it does?

374
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,190
I mean, each one sort of
has a unique thing.

375
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,437
I don't know.

376
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,438
- Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

377
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,483
Uh... Here's to that.

378
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,326
- You wanna? Yeah.
- Oh.

379
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,123
Okay. Well, here goes nothing.

380
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,757
Ugh. Man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

381
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,638
You're gonna kill yourselves!

382
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,062
- Oh, my God. I can't...
- Golly Moses.

383
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,223
You're right.
They're gonna kill themselves.

384
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,559
Don't you have some shower
to go haunt?

385
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,394
Oh, no one's
showering right now.

386
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,692
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

387
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,573
Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

388
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,617
Just a bit zozzled, I think.

389
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,412
He was quite naked.

390
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,703
Remarkably well-preserved.

391
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,335
Guess it's possible
to age gracefully.

392
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,962
Oh, my God.

393
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,005
Fuck, man. I can't watch this.

394
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,377
See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

395
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,844
You act like you don't care,

396
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,638
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

397
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,723
Yeah, then... Then why
is everyone acting

398
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,676
like I'm not a part
of it anymore?

399
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,140
Maybe it's time to blouse
this Popsicle stand.

400
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,807
- You mean, leave?
- Why not?

401
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,688
Go find a story to watch

402
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,519
that doesn't make you
so depressed.

403
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,605
Oh, I think they did it.

404
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,746
I'm having a good time.

405
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,542
Mmm.

406
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,708
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close...

407
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,569
Rise and shine, princess.

408
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,659
Who?

409
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,703
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

410
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,701
to black out after,
what, five drinks?

411
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,551
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

412
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,621
I don't...

413
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,703
Okay.

414
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,497
Um...

415
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,008
Seriously.

416
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,053
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

417
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,468
Sorry, um, can you...
Are you... Are you seeing this?

418
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,313
Nobody cares, dude.

419
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,857
They all have actual jobs,
unlike you.

420
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,354
Right, okay.

421
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,981
No problem.

422
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,079
- What the fuck did you do?
- Okay, I can explain.

423
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,033
- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

424
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,410
- It's all right.
- There's another me.

425
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,618
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

426
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,418
Nothing about this is all right.

427
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,246
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

428
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,790
- The key does have a power.
- No shit.

429
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,466
It takes the darkest parts
of you

430
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,465
and makes a kind of...
Well, you met it.

431
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,924
It's kind of like
a depression monster?

432
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,634
Looks like you, talks like you.

433
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,221
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

434
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,898
- Unless...
- Unless?

435
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,441
Unless it gets in your head

436
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,713
and convinces you
to hurt yourself.

437
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,478
- Well...
- But you'll be fine.

438
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,550
It only affects the last
person who touched the key.

439
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,531
So just pass it along
to someone else.

440
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,656
- That's what we did.
- Who's we?

441
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,907
My former shipmates.

442
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,408
After I stole the key,

443
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,831
we passed it
from person to person

444
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,751
until we, you know,
ran out of options.

445
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,999
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

446
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,256
Um...

447
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,797
Hit an iceberg?

448
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,903
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

449
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,919
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

450
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,799
You have to be, like,
a badass about it,

451
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,721
and what can I say?

452
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,549
- They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

453
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,681
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

454
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,021
Hmm. Maybe, like, half?

455
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,061
This key made half
of your shipmates

456
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,517
kill themselves,
and you gave it to me?

457
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,443
Yeah. But don't worry.

458
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,318
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

459
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,616
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

460
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,610
No. No, no.

461
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,871
I'm not. This is like...

462
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,414
It's like we're on a boat, okay?

463
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,991
This is not how I usually am.

464
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,826
You're usually a wet blanket,
self-pitying,

465
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,036
party pooping dickwad.

466
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,042
Shut up!

467
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,419
You better pass that along fast.

468
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,876
What? No! Not if there is a 50%

469
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,506
chance of it killing
the next person.

470
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,721
Okay.

471
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,184
Right, yep.
I'll just hold on to it.

472
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,352
Until we get back to Whitespire.

473
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,723
- I can do that.
- Your choice.

474
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,227
I mean, we're stuck in The Abyss

475
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,525
till we found our way out.

476
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,611
It could be days.

477
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,311
It could be weeks.

478
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,446
But hey. Don't stress.

479
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,986
- You might be fine.
- You won't be.

480
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,408
You know what?

481
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,658
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

482
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,240
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

483
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,745
that I've got a black belt.

484
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,246
So come at me.

485
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,457
The problem is your hair.

486
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,029
I know you're just trying
to hide your face,

487
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,760
but it really only
makes it worse.

488
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,762
Seriously, have you ever noticed

489
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,326
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

490
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,932
If feet had frown lines?

491
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,975
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

492
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,930
which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

493
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,640
Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

494
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,602
And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

495
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,561
a senile frowny foot-face.

496
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,692
Jesus. Fuck.

497
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,615
This is pointless.
You can't run me off.

498
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,864
You can't eat me off.

499
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,741
You can't drink me off.

500
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,996
You can't jerk me off.

501
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,542
God, you're so vulgar.

502
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,171
We had a thing going,
and you... You made it

503
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,047
unnecessarily gross.

504
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,754
You sick of the shallow,
petty stuff?

505
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,257
I get it.

506
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,059
The thing is,
I start on the outside,

507
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,102
and I work my way into the core.

508
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,940
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

509
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,267
when you could have helped her,

510
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,695
that is what set her
on that path.

511
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:54,274
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

512
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,194
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

513
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,619
You ruined her.

514
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,205
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

515
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,874
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

516
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,921
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

517
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,665
Just stop!

518
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,966
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

519
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,635
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

520
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,679
But you are never
gonna feel okay.

521
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,303
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

522
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,933
Quentin.

523
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,228
I am your head.

524
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,273
You know I'm right
because I am you.

525
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,817
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

526
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,698
Fomar.

527
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,529
Bottoms up.

528
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,164
In my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

529
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,706
Drink the wine, Margo.

530
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,332
I don't wanna drink the wine.

531
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,756
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

532
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,583
You'll feel better if you just

533
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,636
drink the wine, Margo.

534
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,815
So, um...

535
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,106
Do we have sex in the carriage?

536
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,905
Or do we have sex outside?

537
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:20,031
- Or do...
- I'm not having sex with you.

538
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,329
You psychotic fetus.

539
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,118
Ever.

540
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,375
Either I just killed him
with my rage

541
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,926
or you drugged his wine.

542
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,753
And to think...

543
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,963
You doubted me.

544
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,057
To think.

545
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,557
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

546
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,855
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

547
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,274
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

548
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,192
than sleeping beauty over here.

549
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,339
The fairies are up to something

550
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,363
in the Northern Orchards.

551
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,313
They evacuated the villagers
weeks ago

552
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,649
and haven't let another
human in since.

553
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,952
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

554
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,030
and he saw some crazy shit.

555
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,457
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

556
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,411
mutant plant life,
Chernobyl-level shit.

557
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,417
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

558
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,591
Great, well,
now I can't be mad at you.

559
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,252
Thanks.

560
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,674
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

561
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,844
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

562
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,053
- we could just...
- Be us again?

563
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,309
Who are we now, El?

564
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,807
We used to be glamorous,

565
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,809
amazing mega-bitches.

566
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,891
And now?

567
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,736
We have depth and character.

568
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,406
Let's decide...
We'll find us again

569
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,825
once we're done saving Fillory.

570
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,152
Okay?

571
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,906
Duty calls.

572
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,912
Let's go see
about these orchards.

573
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,711
Which are...

574
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,592
No longer here.

575
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,016
Nothing is going to save you.
Not Brakebills.

576
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,442
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

577
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,319
Just do it.

578
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,318
Kill yourself.

579
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,650
Make it stop.

580
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,361
You know the way out.

581
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,957
King Quentin, no!

582
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,171
No, I wasn't. I was just...

583
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,947
- I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

584
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,304
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

585
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,181
I thought about it too.

586
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,889
Though I have never spoken
about it, of course.

587
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:52,975
Why not?

588
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,482
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

589
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,689
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

590
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,988
and turn them into maps,
for example.

591
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,576
Jesus, Benedict.

592
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,071
Okay, we should talk about this.

593
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,077
If it please you, Sire,
but first,

594
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,250
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

595
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,791
Yeah. I don't really
trust myself right now.

596
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:25,178
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

597
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,509
the crew would tie them
to the mast.

598
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,973
Isn't that funny?

599
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,550
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

600
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,647
- No... No, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

601
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,809
Okay, swear to me,
no matter what I say,

602
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,486
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

603
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,859
Very well. I won't.

604
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,735
Thank you.

605
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,893
It worked.

606
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,813
Thank you.

607
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,247
Oh, I see the transfer worked.

608
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,417
It's still small, I can feel that,
but I'm gonna grow it.

609
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,994
I hope you'll be careful.

610
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,797
I will be.

611
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,293
You know that fixing my glasses

612
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,885
won't fix me.

613
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,679
Yeah, but they make all of this

614
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,302
one speck less shitty.

615
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,308
It smells like the fairy realm.

616
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,437
We're so far north.

617
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,485
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

618
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,942
Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

619
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,370
All that spritzing and bathing.

620
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,073
You know, it's...
It's like they're afraid

621
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,784
to dry out
in Fillory or something.

622
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,921
Oh, my God.

623
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,214
The fuckers are terraforming.

624
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,175
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

625
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,801
- That is not okay.
- No.

626
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,382
Definitely not.

627
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,557
That mushroom just moved.

628
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,143
- Really?
- Should I pluck it?

629
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,276
I'm gonna do it.

630
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,069
Margo, don't.

631
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,153
Oh.

632
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,741
Uh...

633
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,331
It's a fairy embryo.

634
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,709
- Really?
- These are eggs, El.

635
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,256
I mean, really?

636
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,129
The fairies
aren't just terraforming.

637
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,302
They're growing an army.

638
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,629
Oh, fuck.

639
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,514
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

640
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,812
I mean, think about
all the crazy shit

641
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,514
they've kept us busy with.

642
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:08,147
Earthworms, adolescent slug mash,
turtle semen.

643
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,070
This is all just
a thin frosting of whimsy

644
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,069
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

645
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,527
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

646
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,204
We need a plan bigger than
just assassinating the Queen.

647
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,704
We need... We need... We need...
We need... We need...

648
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,706
We need... Margo?

649
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,706
Margo?

650
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,629
Kidnapping. Hostages. Leverage.

651
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,382
- Don't ask questions, go! Go!
- What the fuck?

652
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,304
Go, go!

653
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,933
It's a bitch, right?

654
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,526
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

655
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,229
Have you tried distracting it?

656
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,031
For some reason, mine was
really into seagulls.

657
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,845
Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

658
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,576
Please, fuck off.

659
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,746
Look, I'm sorry
I passed you the key.

660
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,322
I really thought
you could handle it.

661
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,412
This is me handling it.

662
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,334
No, no, you're right.

663
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,713
I wish we'd thought
of tying ourselves up.

664
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,132
That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

665
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,880
That killed three of us
off quick.

666
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,718
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

667
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,762
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

668
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,386
Others, it takes time
to wear down.

669
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,665
You want me to take the key
for a while?

670
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,850
Give you some relief?

671
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,226
No.

672
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,604
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

673
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,439
And I need it.

674
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,980
- For the quest.
- Fine.

675
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,944
Be a suffer-martyr.

676
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,284
Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

677
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,781
They help sometimes, too.

678
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,077
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

679
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,786
Keyholes, like...

680
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,956
Like in the walls or clocks.

681
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,250
Don't ask me how it works.

682
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,249
So... So where do
the keyholes go?

683
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,836
To Earth or the Neitherlands
or wherever.

684
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,263
Wait, wait. Are you serious?

685
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,392
Stop it. What are you doing?

686
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,750
I've been stuck here
in Fillory this whole time

687
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,981
when I could have gone home?

688
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,650
Hey. No, Poppy, stop it.

689
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,320
Poppy, no. Stop.

690
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,817
Poppy!

691
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,859
I told you
you should've killed yourself.

692
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,904
Okay.

693
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,663
Okay, we just have
one outstanding problem.

694
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,919
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

695
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,588
Don't worry. I got this.

696
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,090
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

697
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,097
- They've got three eyes?
- No, baby.

698
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,137
They've got fangs.

699
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,775
Oh! Oh,
something bit my manhood.

700
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,857
Congratulations, son.
You just had sex.

701
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,737
The first time's always painful.

702
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,989
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

703
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,577
But, hey, you were amazing.

704
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,874
What?

705
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,667
I like to watch.

706
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,921
Wanna go again?

707
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,961
Hmm?

708
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:19,838
<i>Benedict!</i>

709
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,343
Benedict, help!

710
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,745
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my God, Benedict.

711
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,930
Okay, untie me.

712
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,300
Sire, you said not to untie you.

713
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,391
No. No, no, no, no, no.

714
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,722
Please, come on. Okay, look.

715
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,398
I'm not trying to kill myself.

716
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,316
Poppy took the key,
and she is trying

717
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,735
to use it to get back to Earth.

718
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,608
Just... Okay,
go find her yourself.

719
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,315
Just whatever you do, do not
let her leave with that key.

720
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

721
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,744
God.

722
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,707
No! Stop!

723
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,636
Hey, did you get it?

724
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,009
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

725
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,766
I'm a terrible failure.

726
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,436
Okay. It's okay.

727
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,105
We'll get the key back somehow.

728
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,318
Benedict.

729
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,195
Hey, hey. Benedict.

730
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,114
Whoa, Benedict, no. Hey, listen.

731
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,996
Whatever it's telling you
to do, do not do it.

732
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,294
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,706
Benedict, no!

734
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,223
Mmm. Yummy.

735
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,725
Oh.

736
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,161
<i>Oh, as long as I know
how to love</i>

737
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,658
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

738
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,536
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

739
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,618
<i>I've got all my love to give.</i>

740
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,375
<i>And I'll survive, hey, hey.</i>

741
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,127
Penny, what's wrong?

742
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,174
- Just saying goodbye.
- What?

743
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,172
Goodbye? Where are you going?

744
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,004
Just away.

745
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,425
Away... Wait.

746
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,600
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um, I don't understand.

747
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,122
Is this because
of what happened with Kady?

748
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,557
- No.
- Okay.

749
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,958
Is it because
we did the transfer?

750
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,190
No. Look, I gotta go.

751
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,879
Wait, will you just
talk to me for a second?

752
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,236
You know what,
we barely know each other.

753
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,110
Don't suddenly act like
you care just 'cause I'm going.

754
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,691
I'm not acting.

755
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,095
I do care.
I don't want to see you go.

756
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,701
I don't want to see you give up.

757
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,950
- Give up?
- Yeah.

758
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,374
You're the one who had magic,
and you gave it away.

759
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,045
What's your plan?
Go back to law school?

760
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,792
Live off your trust fund?

761
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,465
Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

762
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,919
and try to remember
what life was like

763
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,220
without a god or a quest.

764
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,922
Or some dead asshole
bothering me.

765
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,632
And, I don't know,
frankly beyond that,

766
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,933
it's none of your business.

767
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,762
'Cause you have
nothing beyond that.

768
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,610
Penny wants to say goodbye.

769
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,950
- You're leaving?
- I can't do this anymore.

770
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,404
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

771
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,835
Why don't I just
make you a new body?

772
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,504
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

773
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,893
A-plus job
getting rid of me, gorgeous.

774
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,816
Is this just a dream?

775
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,904
That time you fell out of
the tree when you were 12.

776
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,988
The bone in your arm healed
in six little weeks.

777
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,448
How come your fear
of heights never did?

778
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,289
I'm not the bone.

779
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,216
I'm the terror.

780
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,637
I do love how you keep trying.

781
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,132
And trying.

782
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,012
And trying. And trying.

783
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,145
I have not been punched

784
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,604
that hard since Burning Man.

785
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,441
Where is he? Where did he go?

786
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,906
Why does it smell like barbeque?

787
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,201
Benedict is dead,
and best-case scenario,

788
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,772
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

789
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,833
- Um, Quentin.
- Don't talk to me.

790
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,880
- Please, I mean it.
- Okay.

791
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,879
Just... Just one thing

792
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,649
and I swear I will never
talk to you again.

793
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,715
What?

794
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,762
Dragons don't shit.

795
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,805
Okay, great, fun fact. Thanks.

796
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,349
No one knows exactly
how it works,

797
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,052
but what they ingest
goes elsewhere.

798
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,762
They're gatekeepers, you know?

799
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,392
They don't just make portals.

800
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,849
They are portals.

801
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,649
So, actual best-case scenario...

802
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,605
The key went to the Underworld.

803
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,777
Mmm.

804
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,199
Oh, my God.

805
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,791
If you're here, I'm practicing

806
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,119
an Osseus Confervium.
Bone-knitting.

807
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,954
First step to building
a new body.

808
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,216
I know you can't see me,
but I'm here.

809
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,302
Thanks for giving a shit
about me.

810
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,975
Alice?

811
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,437
Alice, you okay? Alice?

812
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,232
God, Alice. Alice!

813
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,935
God, this is... Where's...

814
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,857
Alice!

815
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:20,035
Okay, okay, God. Come on.

816
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:24,206
Come on, someone's got
to hear this, please.

817
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,463
<i>Oh, as long as I know
how to love</i>

818
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,211
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

819
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,167
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

820
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,298
<i>I've got all my love to give.</i>

821
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,176
<i>And I'll survive, hey, hey.</i>

822
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,407
<i>It took all the strength
I had not to fall apart.</i>

823
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:03,238
<i>Kept trying hard to mend
the pieces of my broken heart</i>
