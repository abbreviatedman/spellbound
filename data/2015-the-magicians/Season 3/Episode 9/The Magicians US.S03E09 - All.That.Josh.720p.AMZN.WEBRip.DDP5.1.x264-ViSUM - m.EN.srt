1
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,679
<i>Previously on</i>
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:11,879
Children of Earth have been making a
mess of things here for some time.

3
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:19,806
I demand that this trial/peasant
uprising be dismissed.

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,367
Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

5
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,218
Come with me if you want to live.

6
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:27,093
It has begun.

7
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:29,022
Sorry.

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,410
Is that cocaine?

9
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:33,605
It's the excretion of a very
rare magical creature.

10
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:35,160
But yes,
you will have to snort it.

11
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,832
- What creature?
- A fairy?

12
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,535
And I can't see her because
I've never made a fairy deal?

13
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:42,496
My daughter's dead because of them.

14
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:45,160
You need to talk to Irene's fairy.

15
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:46,824
My name is Skye.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,949
Fen, what is it?
What do you see?

17
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,044
It's her, it's Skye.

18
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:51,527
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

19
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:54,144
<i>That's what
the powder is made of.</i>

20
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,785
Weren't you supposed to
report to the Underworld

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,683
<i>branch of the Library anyway?</i>

22
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:05,511
Yeah, and I burned my body
to avoid that.

23
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,785
Did you...

24
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:08,574
Okay, come on.

25
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,519
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

26
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,972
Maybe we should've waited at the
mirror for a little while longer.

27
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,621
- I mean, maybe they survived somehow.
- They didn't.

28
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,152
Ask her.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,238
Harriet and Victoria were in the bridge.

30
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,965
I'm pretty sure both mirrors shattered.

31
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,199
Oh, my God. No.

32
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:46,254
There's your answer.

33
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:49,464
Where's your bag?

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,019
I need the Truth Key.

35
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,714
To see Penny, if he made it back.

36
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,004
All right.

37
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,918
You found The Fourth Key?

38
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:08,808
Here we go.

39
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,911
Okay. It's in code.

40
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,164
Mm.

41
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:30,867
Be careful with that.

42
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:32,526
Penny?

43
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,478
- This looks familiar.
- You know what?

44
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:35,585
No.

45
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,555
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

46
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,437
I was finishing something.

47
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,617
Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

48
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,178
I needed information.

49
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,281
Penny!

50
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:48,336
Funny, 'cause there is
no magic to unify.

51
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,117
Just let me see it again.

52
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:52,883
No.

53
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,781
I... I know what it is.

54
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,406
Music.

55
00:02:58,452 --> 00:02:59,647
Music?

56
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,055
Medieval music.

57
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:07,937
Here.

58
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,117
Just give it a minute,
okay?

59
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,453
- Sure you're playing it right?
- Yes, I'm sure.

60
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,664
Then you're an idiot.

61
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:29,640
Back then the scale didn't start
at C.

62
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,226
So that's an A.

63
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,577
What?

64
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:36,289
No, I just didn't know that
you had...

65
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,264
Well, me and music go way
back.

66
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:40,647
It's what my mom took her
clothes off to for money.

67
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:43,912
And save the judgment.
She was good.

68
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:48,084
And she liked it.
And it paid for piano lessons.

00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:21,858
Why would the book send us here?
Where are we?

110
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:23,202
Guys.

111
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:24,614
Great to see you.

112
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,757
Seriously, it's been too long.

113
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,483
Little word of advice,
this is a no-rules zone,

114
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:30,586
except one...

115
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,569
You gotta be the vibe.

116
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:36,897
And the vibe is fun-in-the-sun, and
you can't throw shade, capisce?

117
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,338
I have no idea
what you just said.

118
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,131
Good to see you, uh...

119
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,194
Where are we, exactly?

120
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:50,928
And why are they doing that?

121
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,584
Okay, guys.

122
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,912
Guys, it's okay.
It's okay, all right?

123
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:58,061
What Joshster was telling you,

124
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,101
it's all good
in the New World Order,

125
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,755
but one rule, okay?

126
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,967
Have a blast, or adios.

127
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,168
How do we "adios," Todd?
There's no door.

128
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,947
True, but the trade-off...

129
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,393
Is this.

130
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,049
Holy shit.

131
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:18,510
Yeah, we're not just
partying 'cause it's fun.

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,846
Uh-uh.

133
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:28,761
We're tearing it up 'cause
magic is back, my babies.

134
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,510
Yeah, it is.

135
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,101
Whoo-hoo.

136
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:38,918
How? I...

137
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:41,838
Two words... who cares?

138
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,781
Oh, my gosh, this feels...

139
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:38,651
That bone saw,
the smith who forged it

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,932
must've been a monster.

141
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,011
Fen, I did a whole line of
that fairy coke shit.

142
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,473
All right? We've gotta help.

143
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,893
- We can't.
- Excuse me?

144
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,471
I agreed that what's being
done to the fairies is awful,

145
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,393
but they are evil, and I told
you what they did to me,

146
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,698
my daughter.

147
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,846
And Julia,
they can't be enslaved.

148
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:56,083
They can do magic.

149
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,971
Yeah,
but that was in Fillory.

150
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,901
You know,
it's obviously different here.

151
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:02,987
Maybe...
maybe they're different.

152
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,227
And I can see them
without making a deal.

153
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,297
How?

154
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,688
What the fuck me hell?

155
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,326
You've been found guilty.

156
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:28,602
By a marsupial
in a wig and a robe.

157
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,876
The judge you requested for trial.

158
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,996
- The Wombat?
- Wombat?

159
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,915
Jesus, Tick, I said combat.

160
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,672
We wanted trial by combat.

161
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,307
That is not, as you would say,

162
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,924
"a thing" in Fillory.

163
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:43,907
Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

164
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,196
If we'd known
it was a wombat judge,

165
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,118
we would've hired a wombat lawyer.

166
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:50,602
There is some good news.

167
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,602
You are free...

168
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,743
to choose the manner of
your execution.

169
00:09:58,654 --> 00:09:59,800
Tick.

170
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,086
I don't mean to sound snappish,

171
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,344
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

172
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:09,626
It's an honor only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

173
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:10,937
Let's see.

174
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,688
The serrated spoon......

175
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,188
Don't pick that one.

176
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:17,790
The steep climb up
Fire Ant Mountain.

177
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,946
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

178
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:22,696
The Infinite Waterfall.
The Stone Crush.

179
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,165
Wait.

180
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:25,844
Infinite Waterfall?

181
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,915
It's quite horrid, and wet.

182
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,040
Right.

183
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:33,842
But... which death on your
little list takes the longest?

184
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,272
The one with the word "infinite" in it.

185
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:38,869
- Right?
- Right.

186
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,944
A lot of time to...

187
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:44,451
Think on our royal sins
and repent.

188
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,655
Plan on how best to...

189
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,241
Meet death...

190
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,858
gracefully.

191
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:53,162
As desired then.

192
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,092
You will plummet
through freezing waters

193
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,797
against walls of razor rocks,

194
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,803
so you bleed out or drown,
or if you're lucky,

195
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,834
just starve to death.

196
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,108
I really don't think we could've
picked a better option.

197
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:18,644
Feels really good.

198
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:20,321
There's something very wrong here.

199
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,068
None of my locator spells are
working.

200
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:23,429
I... I don't know where we are.

201
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,265
How about I just blow
a hole in the wall?

202
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,444
Sure, go ahead, but...

203
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:31,979
The only magic that works here is...

204
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,584
- Party tricks.
- Yeah.

205
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:34,936
Look, we're on the Quest.

206
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:38,123
So maybe there's a clue
in what we can and can't do.

207
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:41,122
What we can't do is
sit around here getting blitzed

208
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,951
on never-ending scotch.

209
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,092
It's cognac, actually.

210
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,811
- Easy.
- You, easy.

211
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,225
- For all I know, this is you.
- Me?

212
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:52,514
Yeah, doing shit
for your Library buddies

213
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,592
- to slow us down.
- Okay, hey, you know what?

214
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:57,397
We're all pretty raw,
so why don't we have a drink?

215
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,449
Wait a bit. Wh...

216
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,114
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it e...

217
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,016
Ah. No, no, no, no, no.

218
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:16,819
No, no, no, no. I'm not...

219
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:21,190

220
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:24,354

There's Josh.

226
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,095
We have to figure this out now.

227
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,383
- We can't do it here.
- We gotta get him alone.

228
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,172
I can get him upstairs.

229
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,513
Somebody has to stay here
and put on a show

230
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,966
so that they don't pick up
on any bad vibes.

231
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:00,568
Okay. You take the nerd.

232
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:04,043
I got these bozos.

233
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:14,898
I can thank good ol' mom.

234
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,265
Ah.

235
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:51,381
Here. Here, I...

236
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:52,945
Who are you?

237
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:54,367
How can you see me?

238
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:55,929
I'm Julia.

239
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,476
You've probably seen me
with Irene?

240
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,093
You're Skye.

241
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,499
Um, my... my friend Fen,
she told me about you,

242
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:03,960
about what happened with your leg.

243
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,406
I'm sorry, I'm very busy.

244
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,788
You clean their homes,
you cook their food,

245
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,796
and they take your leg
and grind it into powder

246
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,382
to snort so they can do magic tricks.

247
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,445
I wanna help you get out of here.

248
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,304
No.

249
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,226
No, this is the way.

250
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,234
We can't do magic.

251
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,531
We're helpless.

252
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,554
The McAllistairs, they protect us.

253
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,228
No, the McAllistairs use you.
And they hurt you.

254
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:34,273
Mrs. McAllistair
will be angry if I'm late.

255
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:38,064
I'm told that fairies can do magic.

256
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,257
If that's true,
if I can show you that,

257
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:45,898
it proves that the McAllistairs
have lied to you.

258
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,765
About everything.

259
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,906
Meet me in the lab as soon
as you can get away.

260
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:55,249
Deal?

00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,656

262
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,421
- ♪ Got my hair... ♪
- Wait.

263
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,226
Wrong key. Try E.

264
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,132
It's in A.

265
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:30,031
We like it in E.

266
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:37,015
That's... an excellent idea.

267
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:38,890
Thank you.

268
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,460
I always felt a connection.

269
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:44,593
Especially when you'd glare at me
like you were trying to kill me.

270
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,382
I always thought
you were annoying.

271
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:49,281
Which turns out to be
my power move.

272
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:51,609

Is this a thing you guys are into?

293
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:27,626
I'm not judging,
it's just a little high school.

294
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,416
Oh, my God.

295
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,016
Is that the book?

296
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,415
Not here.

297
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:37,010
All right, of course.
It's not even our piano.

298
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,422
It's just a part of all this.

299
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,306
I don't know what you
guys are babbling about.

300
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,978
I had it moved up here
so I could rehearse.

301
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:43,447
Hence the reason it's in my room.

302
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:44,532
This isn't your room.

303
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,391
Yeah, Josh, you're a Naturalist.
This is not even your house.

304
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,231
That's pretty much all you
know about me, right?

305
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,330
Where am I from?

306
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,982
Where'd I go to undergrad?

307
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,380
When is the last time
we actually saw each other?

308
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,446
A couple of weeks ago? I...

309
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,475
Exactly. I texted, I called.

310
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:02,587
Over and over, to try to get
back with you guys

311
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:04,948
- and go on the Quest.
- Go ahead, check your phones.

312
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:08,579
I got one reply, from Julia.

313
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:10,010
Then Nada from any of you.

314
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,212
And that's pretty much all
you think about me, right?

Ventriloquist act. Nice trick.

321
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,063
Is that even your voice down there?

322
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,293
<i>Brava.</i>

323
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,570
You really contacted a lot.

324
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,141
Um, uh, sorry, we were just so...

325
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,899
Narcissistically up
your own asses?

326
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,939
Look, you ditched us
in Fillory, so it's not...

327
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,985
Not the same.
That was cowardice.

328
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:57,524
Not indifference.

329
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,240
Look, it's fine. It's fine.

330
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,059
Because we don't really know each other,
and now we don't need to.

331
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,243
Quest is over. Magic is back.

332
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:06,407
Okay, great, well,
then just magic yourself

333
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,079
out of those ropes.

334
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:13,598
That is weird.

335
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,414
Josh, I know you're
a smart guy.

336
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:16,895
And you want to believe
that this is real

337
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,059
because it feels so good,
but this isn't life, okay?

338
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:22,072
And I'm worried the longer you stay here,
the less you'll want to leave.

339
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:25,273
Look, he wants to stay. Fine.

340
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,776
Just tell us how you got here
so we can get out.

341
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,432
Leave us.

342
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,377
All right.

343
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:50,334
Good, good, good,
good, good, good, good.

344
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,565
You pickpocketed the key?

345
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:52,963
I did...

346
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:54,182
not.

347
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:56,238
Wait till it gets dark, that's better.

348
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:57,807
Let me stop you right there.

349
00:19:58,128 --> 00:19:59,776
I will not be helping you escape.

350
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,823
In fact, I will not be
helping you with anything,

351
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,502
- ever again.
- Wait, what?

352
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:05,713
You're the worst.

353
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:09,049
The absolute worst rulers
Fillory has ever had.

354
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,834
Oh, come on. Martin Chatwin?

355
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,963
All of you. Children of Earth.

356
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,916
The divine prank of
Ember and Umber's.

357
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,971
And you know
what's truly infuriating?

358
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,198
How you always really believe
you have the right.

359
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:22,011
Look, we didn't make
the rules here.

360
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,307
We don't even like them.

361
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:26,545
Good, as they no longer need
to be followed.

362
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,335
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

363
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,119
and I get my Kingdom back.

364
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:33,526
Your Kingdom?

365
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,994
I ran Fillory for years.

366
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:38,382
Tick.

367
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:41,916
Maybe we can just take a beat, okay?

368
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:45,198
If there's something that
we did or didn't do,

369
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,502
or missed or fucked up,

370
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,277
don't you think after everything

371
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:50,756
that we have been through,
you couldn't just,

372
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,185
I don't know, maybe talk to us?

373
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:56,650
I refuse to beg for what
I have waited to seize.

374
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,229
Now is the time.

375
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:02,627
Muntjac,

376
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,784
we are going to the Infinite Waterfall.

377
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,901
As soon as we reach
the point of no return,

378
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:10,080
we'll put them in a lifeboat
and let the rapids

379
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,737
carry them over the edge.

380
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,573
And then finally have a free Fillory

381
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:18,713
of, for, and by Fillorians like us.

382
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,330
What do you say?

383
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,244
Allies?

384
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:27,252
Her too?

385
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,185
Does everybody hate us?

386
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,760
All right, you've got us
guarded and locked down here.

387
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,108
You might as well just undo these.

388
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:37,896
I shall...

389
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,221
not.

390
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,126
Okay, the "not" thing is kind of arch.

391
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:04,472
How is this not a terrible idea?

392
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,549
Fen, whatever they did,
they don't deserve to...

393
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,689
I mean, nobody deserves to...

394
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,619
Mrs. McAllistair is dining.

395
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,057
I have one hour.

396
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,150
Uh.

397
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:24,635
Uh, okay, um,
we won't push too hard.

398
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,596
I just want to see what you can do.

399
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:31,533
So after I couldn't find Kady,

400
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,103
I called and called

401
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:37,215
- and called...
- Okay, we suck. Got it.

402
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:39,019
Next?

403
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:42,558
I went back to Bacchus'.
Party was still raging.

404
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,644
<i>But no matter how hard
I hit the pharmaceuticals,</i>

405
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:46,614
<i>I couldn't shake the fact
that I was ditched hard</i>

406
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:47,947
by you guys.

407
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:50,101
Which wasn't exactly unfamiliar.

408
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:51,877
And, can you untie me?

409
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,635
You've made your point
and I can't feel my thumbs.

410
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,870
It's a life theme for me, I guess.

411
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:04,014
You know, my brother
got us tickets to that concert.

412
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,044
Turned out to be the last one
Bowie did in the U.S.

413
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,525
- I saw it.
- It was amazing, wasn't it?

414
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,488
Is what I heard from my brother,

415
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,550
who ditched me
to take Ann Posner.

416
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:17,102
And even after they got back
and told me how great it was,

417
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:19,081
and that Bowie went
into the middle of the crowd

418
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,417
to do "Under Pressure,"

419
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,488
I didn't feel as bad as I should've

420
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,416
because I was just like,
"This is what happens.

421
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,948
This is what's always gonna happen."

422
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,416
Can we just get back to the
part of how you got here?

423
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,011
- Todd?
- What's up, brother?

424
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,322
Not my dick. I gotta crash.

425
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,259
Hey, uh...

426
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:48,338
Let you in on a little secret?

427
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,096
Get the fuck out.

428
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:59,049
Okay... one, if I'm tripping,
keep me on a molly drip.

429
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,798
Two, who else knows?

430
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,264
Three, how?

431
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,106
- Ooh.
- One, you are not tripping.

432
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:14,409
Two, everyone who needs to know.

433
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,096
And three...

434
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,963
<i>Wait, Todd has the Fifth Key?</i>

435
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,886
It's one of them. I'm not sure.

436
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:23,291
Well, let's get it.

437
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,033
Well...

438
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:27,963
The key

439
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:31,291
isn't the key to what
we're getting up to here.

440
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:33,229
Okay, but that's pretty important.

441
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,462
I need to tell my friends.
Are they here?

442
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:38,376
And sorry, but how can magic be back

443
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,212
if you have one of the keys?

444
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:43,946
And why are they...

445
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:45,377
Yes, we lived it.

446
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,148
- Uh, have a blast or...
- Adios. - Adios. - Adios.

447
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:50,697
That wasn't maybe a clue
all this was fake?

448
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,205
It's not fake.
It's just different, okay?

449
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,932
Magic comes back, it's a little off.

450
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,313

Look, have you seen anybody
else you know other than Todd?

456
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:24,191
- Have you been outside?
- I mean, these guys are great.

457
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,425
And I'll get a campus tour as soon as...

458
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,658
Josh, this is not Brakebills.

459
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,604
And this Todd, very un-Todd.

460
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:36,287
The real Todd isn't creepily
bossy with a prancing army

461
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:38,354
that turns psycho the m...

462
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:40,619
Oh, no.

463
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,744
Okay, Josh, the quest
brought us here for a reason,

464
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,994
and it's not to party to death
for Todd's pleasure.

465
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,706
- Uh...
- Wait, that's it.

466
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:57,557
- What's it?
- Why Todd isn't Todd.

467
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,809
I think...

468
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:00,178
Shit.

469
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:03,354
Okay, look, we have been
total dicks to you,

470
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,545
and I swear to you,
we are gonna make it up to you,

471
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:08,425
but you have to buy us some time
so that we can figure this out.

472
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:10,221
Figure it out or don't,
but if you're right,

473
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,002
and this is my own private Idaho,

474
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,689
I want you out of it.

475
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,810
Let's hustle.

476
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:41,733
Ready?

477
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,239
Okay.

478
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:49,789
It's okay.

479
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:51,665
Again.

480
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:56,690
One, two, three.

481
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:06,802
This is silly.

482
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:09,818
Maybe you're teaching it wrong.

483
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:15,321
I've never seen a fairy do all
that Magician-y finger bending.

484
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:16,571
They are magic.

485
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,247
They don't have to access it.

486
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:21,272
They just get right to
the ruining-your-life part.

487
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:24,699
Okay.

488
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,841
Here. Give me your hand.

489
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:36,489
Imagine a flower growing out
of the palm of your hand.

490
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,270
But don't picture it in your head.

491
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:41,372
Picture it here.

492
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,833
In the real world.

00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:52,518

00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,710

00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:58,128
- Wait, Todd's a what?
- A traumesser.

496
00:27:58,197 --> 00:27:59,704
It's from German folk tales.

497
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,355
It's a demon
who creates a pocket world

498
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,417
where... all your fantasies
come true,

499
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,394
and then feeds off your happiness.

500
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,433
So, it's a joy junkie?

501
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:10,589
Yeah, and it created all this
to mainline Josh.

502
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:13,167
Who just happens to look like Todd?

503
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:14,570
It's also a shape-shifter.

504
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,167
But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

505
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:19,779
- And, why would it hide it?
- I don't know.

506
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,815
It's not malevolent.
Well, for demons.

507
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:25,198
Okay, so the demon
had the Fifth Key here.

508
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:26,840
The book brought us here, so the...

509
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:29,370
the key is still gotta be here, right?

510
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:33,690
Ugh, boy, not working in E.

511
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,284
- What?
- Uh, just the... the song.

512
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:40,496
- Not Todd has a fetish for...
- E.

513
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:42,986
- The Fifth Key.
- But from A.

514
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:57,901
Wait, wait. No fingers.

515
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:04,100
Sometimes bad shit happens.

516
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,903
Give it a sec.

517
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,188
See if it tells us what it is.

518
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,650
Honey, you don't have to listen to Tick.

519
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,338
You can just do your own thing.

520
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:30,119
Turn around,
head home, relax, whatevs.

521
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:38,514
Nothing.

522
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,893
Maybe Tick was right about us.

523
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:44,627
I mean, what really gave us
the right?

524
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:48,318
Hey, we didn't make the world.

525
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:51,330
It was baked by fucking
goat-meat nut-jobs,

526
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:53,033
so of course it's insane.

527
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,426
And of course we're insane for
thinking we can make it better.

528
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,025
- But you know what?
- What?

529
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,525
We did.

530
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:02,830
- For a hot minute, we did.
- When?

531
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,408
Right after you
and Idri sealed that deal.

532
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:07,166
And he turned into a rat?

533
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:09,416
I said "one hot minute."

534
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:11,742
I meant, literally one perfect minute

535
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,236
on this god-fucked rock.

536
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:17,393
And we can do it again.
We made it better.

537
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:18,702
I mean, come on.

538
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:19,810
We've pretty much

539
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,879
- only ever had each other.
- Ugh.

540
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:24,221
And that's gotten us through
pretty much everything.

541
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,080
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, everything.

542
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:27,451
Everything.

543
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:30,713
Well, whatever happens,

544
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,869
thank you for giving us
the time where we can finally

545
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:39,783
just speak with no bullshit,
and I can just say,

546
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:43,119
I love you, Margo.

547
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:45,322
I know.

548
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,885
We've reached the point of
no return.

549
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,580
Please stop so we can cast them off.

550
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,752
Please. Stop.

551
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:03,099
Please?

552
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:07,898
I order you to stop, this moment.

553
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,697
I am your king.

554
00:31:09,774 --> 00:31:11,908
Stop right now.

555
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,305
My first Royal Proclamation...

556
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:44,179
Scuttle all ships that can think.

557
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,155
Write that down.

558
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:50,152
I don't suppose you'd stop for me?

559
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:54,775
Ah.

560
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,290
Fuck this.

561
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,283
Holy shit.

562
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:50,164
The necklace.

563
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,611
It kills them when they use magic.

564
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:56,435
- How could I not...
- Your eyes.

565
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:59,505
Julia. The magic you just did.

566
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:01,570
You didn't use your hands.

567
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,271
How?

568
00:33:07,478 --> 00:33:09,076
I think I'm leveling up.

576
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,074
Penny.

577
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,490
- Wait, you hear him too?
- Inside your head? Yeah, me too.

578
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,044
Penny, Penny!

579
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,719
Wait, Kady?

580
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:44,554
Oh, my God, Penny, where are you?

581
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,232
I'm... I'm in the Underworld Library.

582
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,209
Where are you? How am I hearing you?

583
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,357
I don't know, but we can all hear you.

584
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,232
Yeah, can you... can you hear all of us?

585
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,326
- Am I hallucinating?
- If you are, so am I.

586
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:56,570
Um...

587
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,646
- Eliot, Margo?
- Quentin?

588
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,640
Penny? What's going on?

589
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:03,524
Uh, okay, it's the Fifth Key;
that must be what it does.

590
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,396
It... it links us all up.

591
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:09,380
Guys, I'm sure this is important,

592
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,732
but I almost killed somebody.

593
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:15,224
And then somehow froze her in time.

594
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,633
And I'm not sure what to do next.

595
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:21,310
So just give me a sec.
Hi.

596
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:24,435
Well, we're chained to a boat
about to go over a waterfall.

597
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:26,932
Yeah, complete
with lacerating rocks, so...

598
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:28,838
Oh, shit, the Infinite Waterfall.

599
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:31,816
Not helping...
wait, you guys have magic.

600
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,128
Can you stop this boat?

601
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,864
No, it's not that kind of magic.

602
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,482
Great, well, enjoy
our death screams, I guess.

603
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,427
Hey, everybody out of my head.

604
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,338
Josh... oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I think, um...

605
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,018
Look, look, we go back to Brakebills.

606
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,577
And then we get the Time
Key, and we reverse...

607
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,232
No, no,
we can't go through the door.

608
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:48,312
Why?

609
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,307
Because we are all
listening to each other.

610
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:53,052
We're speaking to each other.
All eight of us. That...

611
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:56,146
That's what it is, it's unity.
Uh...

612
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,679
The Quest brought us to a world
made for the Quester

613
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,699
who always feels left behind.
The key...

614
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,481
The key needs us to work together.

615
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,371
- Um...
- Oh, bullshit!

616
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:10,262
You know, everything was great
until you guys got here,

617
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:12,118
- <i>so just go.</i>
- Wait, who's that?

618
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:14,121
Perfect, thank you, Penny.

619
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:16,527
You know what? Fuck the rule.

620
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,119
No, Josh, uh, Josh,
just calm down, I...

621
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,732
And fuck you!

622
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:25,129
Wah!

623
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:30,832
Ah, no, no.

624
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,355
Okay, everybody, listen.

625
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,820
Um, we have to save Josh

626
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,479
and convince him
to come back with us.

627
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,528
No idea what you're talking about.

628
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,726
All right, well, we've got
some life and death stakes

629
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,300
of our own over here.

630
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:45,109
Yes, we're all fucked
in our own way, like always.

631
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,506
But if we do not do this,

632
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:48,460
then the Quest is done.

633
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:52,109
Okay, we have to work together
and we have to do it now.

634
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:54,597
All right, it's gonna sound weird,

635
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:57,177
but just go with me.
You're gonna hear music,

636
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,484
and I'm gonna make sure that
everyone knows the words,

637
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:03,484
but every single
one of us has to sing.

638
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:05,266
God, I hate you.

639
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:09,064
Ah, stop! Ugh, no.

640
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:11,890

Who said... what?

709
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:05,067
The only one I'd do this for.

710
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:07,606
To be honest, it was kind of a pain.

711
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:10,870
Nothing personal, Josh,
but after a couple of weeks,

712
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:13,348
I started having doubts whether
your friends would come

713
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:15,778
or... actually be worthy.

714
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:17,755
Right, so this was all a test?

715
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:21,520
Everything's just a test.
Right, Pen?

716
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:24,950
Penny?

717
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:27,870
- Penny, can you hear me?
- Eliot, Margo?

718
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,970
Wait, why can't we hear
each other anymore?

719
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,093
I don't mean to be rude,

720
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,809
but... pigging out on
Josh's dream world

721
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:37,153
has left me a little gassy.

722
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,137
I need a little me time at the ashram.

723
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,005
So...

724
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:46,036
<i>Auf Weidersen.</i> Congratulations.

725
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:48,419
<i>Schnell, schnell.</i>

726
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,559
You can just feel the boring.

727
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:00,466
Thank God.

728
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:06,762
Wait, where is the Truth Key?

729
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:09,309
Is it gone?

730
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:12,700
Just needed to borrow it.

731
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:14,367
Hey, guys.

732
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,205
Phew.

733
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,387
Josh. You never called me back.

734
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,364
The old me was a
dick that way.

735
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:47,216
Really?

736
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,895
- I missed a lot, didn't I?

737
00:41:58,564 --> 00:41:59,680
Yep.

738
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:05,210
