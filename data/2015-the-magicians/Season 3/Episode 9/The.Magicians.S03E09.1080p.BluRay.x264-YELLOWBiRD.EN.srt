1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:02,834
<i>Previously on "The Magicians..."</i>

2
00:00:02,844 --> 00:00:06,724
Children of Earth have been making a
mess of things here for some time.

3
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:15,025
I demand that this trial/peasant
uprising be dismissed.

4
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:17,527
Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

5
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:19,029
Come with me if you want to live.

6
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,899
It has begun.

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,933
Sorry.

8
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:25,401
Is that cocaine?

9
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,371
It's the excretion of a very
rare magical creature.

10
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,159
But yes, you will have to snort it.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,936
- What creature?
- A fairy?

12
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:35,411
And I can't see her because
I've never made a fairy deal?

13
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:37,380
My daughter's dead because of them.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,382
You need to talk to Irene's fairy.

15
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:41,717
My name is Skye.

16
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:43,552
Fen, what is it? What do you see?

17
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:44,720
It's her, it's Skye.

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,288
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

19
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:49,725
<i>That's what the powder is made of.</i>

20
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:51,383
_

21
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:52,727
_

22
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,630
Weren't you supposed to
report to the Underworld

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,899
<i>branch of the Library anyway?</i>

24
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,301
Yeah, and I burned my body
to avoid that.

25
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,237
Did you...

26
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,805
Okay, come on.

27
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:09,344
Alice, are you working with the Library?

28
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:22,908
Maybe we should've waited at the
mirror for a little while longer.

29
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,227
- I mean, maybe they survived somehow.
- They didn't.

30
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:28,333
Ask her.

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,767
Harriet and Victoria were in the bridge.

32
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:36,274
I'm pretty sure both mirrors shattered.

33
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:39,157
Oh, my God. No.

34
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,950
There's your answer.

35
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,570
Where's your bag?

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,113
I need the Truth Key.

37
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:47,714
To see Penny, if he made it back.

38
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,387
All right.

39
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,594
You found The Fourth Key?

40
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:03,738
Here we go.

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,373
Okay. It's in code.

42
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,152
Be careful with that.

43
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,420
Penny?

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,322
- This looks familiar.
- You know what?

45
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,555
No.

46
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:33,692
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

47
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,328
I was finishing something.

48
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,896
Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

49
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,177
I needed information.

50
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:40,365
Penny!

51
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,502
Funny, 'cause there is
no magic to unify.

52
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,313
Just let me see it again.

53
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:48,073
No.

54
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,055
I... I know what it is.

55
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:52,540
Music.

56
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:54,727
Music?

57
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:56,722
Medieval music.

58
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,695
Here.

59
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,067
Just give it a minute, okay?

60
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,247
- Sure you're playing it right?
- Yes, I'm sure.

61
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,669
Then you're an idiot.

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,696
Back then the scale didn't start at C.

63
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,112
So that's an A.

64
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:29,446
What?

65
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,319
No, I just didn't know that you had...

66
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,150
Well, me and music go way back.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,919
It's what my mom took her
clothes off to for money.

68
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:38,722
And save the judgment. She was good.

69
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:42,934
And she liked it.
And it paid for piano lessons.

70
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,532
What? Where'd it go?

71
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,899
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

72
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:10,227
What the hell?

73
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,560
Where did these people come from?

74
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,259
Who are they?

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,718
- I don't recognize them.
- What time is it, y'all?

76
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:20,746
Todd.

77
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:23,532
Yeah, it's time for the one, the only

00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,036

104
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,835
Really?

105
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,804

Well, it's not hell for Josh.

107
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,972
Why would the book send us here?
Where are we?

108
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,410
Guys.

109
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,545
Great to see you.

110
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,713
Seriously, it's been too long.

111
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:24,216
Little word of advice,
this is a no-rules zone,

112
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,317
except one...

113
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,385
You gotta be the vibe.

114
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:31,723
And the vibe is fun-in-the-sun, and
you can't throw shade, capisce?

115
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,989
I have no idea what you just said.

116
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:41,599
Good to see you, uh...

117
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,734
Where are we, exactly?

118
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,103
And why are they doing that?

119
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,738
Okay, guys.

120
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:50,241
Guys, it's okay. It's okay, all right?

121
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:52,900
What Joshster was telling you,

122
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,912
it's all good in the New World Order,

123
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,747
but one rule, okay?

124
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:58,849
Have a blast, or adios.

125
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:01,985
How do we "adios," Todd?
There's no door.

126
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:05,255
True, but the trade-off...

127
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:08,425
Is this.

128
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,927
Holy shit.

129
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:13,430
Yeah, we're not just
partying 'cause it's fun.

130
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:23,440
We're tearing it up 'cause
magic is back, my babies.

131
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,610
Yeah, it is.

132
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,985
Whoo-hoo.

133
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:33,883
How? I...

134
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,673
Two words... who cares?

135
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:56,405
Oh, my gosh, this feels...

136
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:33,433
That bone saw, the smith who forged it

137
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:34,742
must've been a monster.

138
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,890
Fen, I did a whole line of
that fairy coke shit.

139
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:39,292
All right? We've gotta help.

140
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:40,547
- We can't.
- Excuse me?

141
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:43,117
I agreed that what's being
done to the fairies is awful,

142
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:46,220
but they are evil, and I told
you what they did to me,

143
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,688
my daughter.

144
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:49,623
And Julia, they can't be enslaved.

145
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,858
They can do magic.

146
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,860
Yeah, but that was in Fillory.

147
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,795
You know, it's obviously different here.

148
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:59,140
Maybe... maybe they're different.

149
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,438
And I can see them
without making a deal.

150
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:07,716
How?

151
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:19,585
What the fuck me hell?

152
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,221
You've been found guilty.

153
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,323
By a marsupial in a wig and a robe.

154
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,791
The judge you requested for trial.

155
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,827
- The Wombat?
- Wombat?

156
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:29,762
Jesus, Tick, I said combat.

157
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:31,630
We wanted trial by combat.

158
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,998
That is not, as you would say,

159
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:34,600
"a thing" in Fillory.

160
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,738
Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

161
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,906
If we'd known it was a wombat judge,

162
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,476
we would've hired a wombat lawyer.

163
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:45,911
There is some good news.

164
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:47,897
You are free...

165
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:52,259
to choose the manner of your execution.

166
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:54,919
Tick.

167
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,089
I don't mean to sound snappish,

168
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:00,492
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

169
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:04,596
It's an honor only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

170
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,805
Let's see.

171
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,966
The serrated spoon......

172
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,301
Don't pick that one.

173
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:12,336
The steep climb up Fire Ant Mountain.

174
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,939
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

175
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,709
The Infinite Waterfall. The Stone Crush.

176
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,110
Wait.

177
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,511
Infinite Waterfall?

178
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,347
It's quite horrid, and wet.

179
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,448
Right.

180
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:29,686
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

181
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,523
The one with the word "infinite" in it.

182
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,791
- Right?
- Right.

183
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,326
A lot of time to...

184
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,496
Think on our royal sins and repent.

185
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,633
Plan on how best to...

186
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,301
Meet death...

187
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,570
gracefully.

188
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,204
As desired then.

189
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,907
You will plummet through freezing waters

190
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,507
against walls of razor rocks,

191
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,811
so you bleed out or drown,
or if you're lucky,

192
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,013
just starve to death.

193
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,350
I really don't think we could've
picked a better option.

194
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:13,576
Feels really good.

195
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,230
There's something very wrong here.

196
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,899
None of my locator spells are working.

197
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,233
I... I don't know where we are.

198
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,069
How about I just blow
a hole in the wall?

199
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,313
Sure, go ahead, but...

200
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,790
The only magic that works here is...

201
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,368
- Party tricks.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,915
Look, we're on the Quest.

203
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:33,048
So maybe there's a clue
in what we can and can't do.

204
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,018
What we can't do is sit
around here getting blitzed

205
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,087
on never-ending scotch.

206
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,189
It's cognac, actually.

207
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,924
- Easy.
- You, easy.

208
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,026
- For all I know, this is you.
- Me?

209
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,195
Yeah, doing shit
for your Library buddies

210
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,297
- to slow us down.
- Okay, hey, you know what?

211
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,033
We're all pretty raw,
so why don't we have a drink?

212
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,107
Wait a bit. Wh...

213
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:00,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it e...

214
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,212
Ah. No, no, no, no, no.

215
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,310
No, no, no, no. I'm not...

216
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:16,780

217
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,417

222
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:42,773
There's Josh.

223
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,942
We have to figure this out now.

224
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:47,543
- We can't do it here.
- We gotta get him alone.

225
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,946
I can get him upstairs.

226
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:51,263
Somebody has to stay here
and put on a show

227
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,933
so that they don't pick up
on any bad vibes.

228
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:57,437
Okay. You take the nerd.

229
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:00,239
I got these bozos.

230
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:11,692
I can thank good ol' mom.

231
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,817
Here. Here, I...

232
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,853
Who are you?

233
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:50,488
How can you see me?

234
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:52,123
I'm Julia.

235
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,625
You've probably seen me with Irene?

236
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,127
You're Skye.

237
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:58,462
Um, my... my friend Fen,
she told me about you,

238
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,030
about what happened with your leg.

239
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,667
I'm sorry, I'm very busy.

240
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,770
You clean their homes,
you cook their food,

241
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,872
and they take your leg
and grind it into powder

242
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,609
to snort so they can do magic tricks.

243
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,978
I wanna help you get out of here.

244
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,479
No.

245
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,615
No, this is the way.

246
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,316
We can't do magic.

247
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,785
We're helpless.

248
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,386
The McAllistairs, they protect us.

249
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,056
No, the McAllistairs use you.
And they hurt you.

250
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,294
Mrs. McAllistair
will be angry if I'm late.

251
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,663
I'm told that fairies can do magic.

252
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,468
If that's true, if I can show you that,

253
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,337
it proves that the McAllistairs
have lied to you.

254
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:43,413
About everything.

255
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:49,645
Meet me in the lab as soon
as you can get away.

256
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,856
Deal?

257
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:14,836

258
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,204

259
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,073
Wait.

260
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,332
Wrong key. Try E.

261
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,544
It's in A.

262
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,047
We like it in E.

263
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:33,721
That's... an excellent idea.

264
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:34,855
Thank you.

265
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,390
I always felt a connection.

266
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,928
Especially when you'd glare at me
like you were trying to kill me.

267
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,396
I always thought you were annoying.

268
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:45,399
Which turns out to be my power move.

269
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,308

Is this a thing you guys are into?

290
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,326
I'm not judging,
it's just a little high school.

291
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,869
Oh, my God.

292
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,798
Is that the book?

293
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:31,929
Not here.

294
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,469
All right, of course.
It's not even our piano.

295
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,003
It's just a part of all this.

296
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,825
I don't know what you
guys are babbling about.

297
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:39,658
I had it moved up here
so I could rehearse.

298
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:40,978
Hence the reason it's in my room.

299
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,307
This isn't your room.

300
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:46,489
Yeah, Josh, you're a Naturalist.
This is not even your house.

301
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:48,959
That's pretty much all you
know about me, right?

302
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,050
Where am I from?

303
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,651
Where'd I go to undergrad?

304
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,020
When is the last time
we actually saw each other?

305
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,221
A couple of weeks ago? I...

306
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,223
Exactly. I texted, I called.

307
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,392
Over and over, to try to get
back with you guys

308
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:01,561
and go on the Quest.

309
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:04,797
Go ahead, check your phones.

310
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,065
I got one reply, from Julia.

311
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,700
Then Nada from any of you.

312
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,902
And that's pretty much all
you think about me, right?

Ventriloquist act. Nice trick.

319
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,765
Is that even your voice down there?

320
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,166
<i>Brava.</i>

321
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,935
You really contacted a lot.

322
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:46,904
Um, uh, sorry, we were just so...

323
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:48,606
Narcissistically up your own asses?

324
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:51,542
Look, you ditched us
in Fillory, so it's not...

325
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:53,911
Not the same. That was cowardice.

326
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,679
Not indifference.

327
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:57,215
Look, it's fine. It's fine.

328
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:59,917
Because we don't really know each
other, and now we don't need to.

329
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:02,086
Quest is over. Magic is back.

330
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,221
Okay, great, well,
then just magic yourself

331
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:06,456
out of those ropes.

332
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,228
That is weird.

333
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,109
Josh, I know you're a smart guy.

334
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,758
And you want to believe
that this is real

335
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,066
because it feels so good,
but this isn't life, okay?

336
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,936
And I'm worried the longer you stay
here, the less you'll want to leave.

337
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,240
Look, he wants to stay. Fine.

338
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,444
Just tell us how you got here
so we can get out.

339
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:40,657
Leave us.

340
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:44,894
All right.

341
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:47,964
Good, good, good,
good, good, good, good.

342
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:49,565
You pickpocketed the key?

343
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,215
I did...

344
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:52,301
not.

345
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:54,165
Wait till it gets dark, that's better.

346
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,004
Let me stop you right there.

347
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,573
I will not be helping you escape.

348
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,409
In fact, I will not be
helping you with anything,

349
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,336
- ever again.
- Wait, what?

350
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:03,579
You're the worst.

351
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:06,815
The absolute worst rulers
Fillory has ever had.

352
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,569
Oh, come on. Martin Chatwin?

353
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,852
All of you. Children of Earth.

354
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:12,854
The divine prank of Ember and Umber's.

355
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:14,690
And you know what's truly infuriating?

356
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,026
How you always really believe
you have the right.

357
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:19,594
Look, we didn't make the rules here.

358
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:21,096
We don't even like them.

359
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:24,332
Good, as they no longer need
to be followed.

360
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:28,035
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

361
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:30,104
and I get my Kingdom back.

362
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:31,272
Your Kingdom?

363
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,675
I ran Fillory for years.

364
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:36,377
Tick.

365
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:39,980
Maybe we can just take a beat, okay?

366
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,950
If there's something that
we did or didn't do,

367
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,318
or missed or fucked up,

368
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,834
don't you think after everything

369
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,511
that we have been through,
you couldn't just,

370
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:49,790
I don't know, maybe talk to us?

371
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,103
I refuse to beg for what
I have waited to seize.

372
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,831
Now is the time.

373
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,368
Muntjac,

374
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:03,670
we are going to the Infinite Waterfall.

375
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,572
As soon as we reach
the point of no return,

376
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:07,907
we'll put them in a lifeboat
and let the rapids

377
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,976
carry them over the edge.

378
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,411
And then finally have a free Fillory

379
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:16,750
of, for, and by Fillorians like us.

380
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,651
What do you say?

381
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,653
Allies?

382
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,759
Her too?

383
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,261
Does everybody hate us?

384
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:32,398
All right, you've got us
guarded and locked down here.

385
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,032
You might as well just undo these.

386
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,571
I shall...

387
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,477
not.

388
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,718
Okay, the "not" thing is kind of arch.

389
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,051
How is this not a terrible idea?

390
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:06,087
Fen, whatever they did,
they don't deserve to...

391
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:08,937
I mean, nobody deserves to...

392
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,402
Mrs. McAllistair is dining.

393
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,471
I have one hour.

394
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:23,344
Uh, okay, um, we won't push too hard.

395
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:26,848
I just want to see what you can do.

396
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:29,617
So after I couldn't find Kady,

397
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:32,453
I called and called and called...

398
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:35,356
Okay, we suck. Got it.

399
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:36,958
Next?

400
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:40,127
I went back to Bacchus'.
Party was still raging.

401
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,463
<i>But no matter how hard
I hit the pharmaceuticals,</i>

402
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:44,465
<i>I couldn't shake the fact
that I was ditched hard</i>

403
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:45,999
by you guys.

404
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,269
Which wasn't exactly unfamiliar.

405
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,836
And, can you untie me?

406
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:52,606
You've made your point
and I can't feel my thumbs.

407
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:58,011
It's a life theme for me, I guess.

408
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:02,182
You know, my brother got us
tickets to that concert.

409
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:05,185
Turned out to be the last one
Bowie did in the U.S.

410
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:08,789
- I saw it.
- It was amazing, wasn't it?

411
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,490
Is what I heard from my brother,

412
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,325
who ditched me to take Ann Posner.

413
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:15,027
And even after they got back
and told me how great it was,

414
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:16,896
and that Bowie went
into the middle of the crowd

415
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:18,230
to do "Under Pressure,"

416
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,132
I didn't feel as bad as I should've

417
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:22,034
because I was just like,
"This is what happens.

418
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,991
This is what's always gonna happen."

419
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,557
Can we just get back to the
part of how you got here?

420
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:38,884
- Todd?
- What's up, brother?

421
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:41,553
Not my dick. I gotta crash.

422
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,889
Hey, uh...

423
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:47,326
Let you in on a little secret?

424
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:53,031
Get the fuck out.

425
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:57,068
Okay... one, if I'm tripping,
keep me on a molly drip.

426
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:59,003
Two, who else knows?

427
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:01,405
Three, how?

428
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,247
- Ooh.
- One, you are not tripping.

429
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:12,550
Two, everyone who needs to know.

430
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,119
And three...

431
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:16,921
<i>Wait, Todd has the Fifth Key?</i>

432
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,790
It's one of them. I'm not sure.

433
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,592
Well, let's get it.

434
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:24,528
Well...

435
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,564
The key

436
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:29,233
isn't the key to what
we're getting up to here.

437
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:31,101
Okay, but that's pretty important.

438
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:33,471
I need to tell my friends.
Are they here?

439
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:36,373
And sorry, but how can magic be back

440
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:37,875
if you have one of the keys?

441
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:41,879
And why are they...

442
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:43,247
Yes, we lived it.

443
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:46,316
Uh, have a blast or... all: Adios.

444
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,585
That wasn't maybe a clue
all this was fake?

445
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:51,087
It's not fake.
It's just different, okay?

446
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,789
Magic comes back, it's a little off.

447
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,124

449
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:06,803

00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:19,581
Look, have you seen anybody
else you know other than Todd?

453
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,984
- Have you been outside?
- I mean, these guys are great.

454
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:24,152
And I'll get a campus tour as soon as...

455
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:26,488
Josh, this is not Brakebills.

456
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:31,026
And this Todd, very un-Todd.

457
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:34,430
The real Todd isn't creepily
bossy with a prancing army

458
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,165
that turns psycho the m...

459
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:38,241
Oh, no.

460
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,775
Okay, Josh, the quest
brought us here for a reason,

461
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,979
and it's not to party to death
for Todd's pleasure.

462
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,847
Wait, that's it.

463
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:55,550
- What's it?
- Why Todd isn't Todd.

464
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,717
I think...

465
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:57,993
Shit.

466
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,522
Okay, look, we have been
total dicks to you,

467
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:03,685
and I swear to you,
we are gonna make it up to you,

468
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,592
but you have to buy us some time
so that we can figure this out.

469
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:08,362
Figure it out or don't,
but if you're right,

470
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,064
and this is my own private Idaho,

471
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:11,540
I want you out of it.

472
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:24,931
Let's hustle.

473
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:40,855
Ready?

474
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:46,919
Okay.

475
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:48,342
It's okay.

476
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:50,397
Again.

477
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:55,201
One, two, three.

478
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:06,371
This is silly.

479
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,388
Maybe you're teaching it wrong.

480
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:14,079
I've never seen a fairy do all
that Magician-y finger bending.

481
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:15,213
They are magic.

482
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:16,782
They don't have to access it.

483
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:19,904
They just get right to
the ruining-your-life part.

484
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,422
Okay.

485
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:27,233
Here. Give me your hand.

486
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:35,800
Imagine a flower growing out
of the palm of your hand.

487
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,135
But don't picture it in your head.

488
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:40,404
Picture it here.

489
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:44,416
In the real world.

490
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:51,315

491
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:54,151

492
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:56,820
- Wait, Todd's a what?
- A traumesser.

493
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,154
It's from German folk tales.

494
00:27:58,164 --> 00:28:00,156
It's a demon who creates a pocket world

495
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,158
where all your fantasies come true,

496
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:03,827
and then feeds off your happiness.

497
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:05,962
So, it's a joy junkie?

498
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:09,265
Yeah, and it created all this
to mainline Josh.

499
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,501
Who just happens to look like Todd?

500
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:13,102
It's also a shape-shifter.

501
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:15,704
But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

502
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:18,341
- And, why would it hide it?
- I don't know.

503
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:20,343
It's not malevolent. Well, for demons.

504
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:23,646
Okay, so the demon
had the Fifth Key here.

505
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:25,281
The book brought us here, so the...

506
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:29,151
the key is still gotta be here, right?

507
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:32,220
Ugh, boy, not working in E.

508
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,124
- What?
- Uh, just the... the song.

509
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:39,361
- Not Todd has a fetish for...
- E.

510
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:41,471
- The Fifth Key.
- But from A.

511
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:56,621
Wait, wait. No fingers.

512
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:02,516
Sometimes bad shit happens.

513
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,520
Give it a sec.

514
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,597
See if it tells us what it is.

515
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,370
Honey, you don't have to listen to Tick.

516
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,871
You can just do your own thing.

517
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:28,996
Turn around, head home, relax, whatevs.

518
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,349
Nothing.

519
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,980
Maybe Tick was right about us.

520
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,456
I mean, what really gave us the right?

521
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:46,927
Hey, we didn't make the world.

522
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:49,930
It was baked by fucking
goat-meat nut-jobs,

523
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,631
so of course it's insane.

524
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,867
And of course we're insane for
thinking we can make it better.

525
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,703
- But you know what?
- What?

526
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,538
We did.

527
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:01,374
- For a hot minute, we did.
- When?

528
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:04,277
Right after you
and Idri sealed that deal.

529
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,712
And he turned into a rat?

530
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,313
I said "one hot minute."

531
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,449
I meant, literally one perfect minute

532
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:13,786
on this god-fucked rock.

533
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,088
And we can do it again.
We made it better.

534
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:17,422
I mean, come on.

535
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,452
We've pretty much
only ever had each other.

536
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,828
And that's gotten us through
pretty much everything.

537
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,896
I mean, everything.

538
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,265
Everything.

539
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:29,601
Well, whatever happens,

540
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:33,472
thank you for giving us
the time where we can finally

541
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:39,411
just speak with no bullshit,
and I can just say,

542
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,446
I love you, Margo.

543
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:44,149
I know.

544
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,424
We've reached the point of no return.

545
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,452
Please stop so we can cast them off.

546
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:00,498
Please. Stop.

547
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:01,740
Please?

548
00:31:03,977 --> 00:31:06,504
I order you to stop, this moment.

549
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:08,539
I am your king.

550
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,827
Stop right now.

551
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:41,155
My first Royal Proclamation...

552
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,139
Scuttle all ships that can think.

553
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:44,823
Write that down.

554
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:48,752
I don't suppose you'd stop for me?

555
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,395
Fuck this.

556
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,844
Holy shit.

557
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,263
The necklace.

558
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:53,005
It kills them when they use magic.

559
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:56,008
- How could I not...
- Your eyes.

560
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:59,245
Julia. The magic you just did.

561
00:32:59,255 --> 00:33:00,915
You didn't use your hands.

562
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,533
How?

563
00:33:06,662 --> 00:33:08,520
I think I'm leveling up.

571
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:36,157
Penny.

572
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:38,505
- Wait, you hear him too?
- Inside your head? Yeah, me too.

573
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,385
Penny, Penny!

574
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,053
Wait, Kady?

575
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,721
Oh, my God, Penny, where are you?

576
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,324
I'm... I'm in the Underworld Library.

577
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:48,559
Where are you? How am I hearing you?

578
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,394
I don't know, but we can all hear you.

579
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,730
Yeah, can you... can you hear all of us?

580
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,565
- Am I hallucinating?
- If you are, so am I.

581
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,733
Um...

582
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,035
- Eliot, Margo?
- Quentin?

583
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,904
Penny? What's going on?

584
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,707
Uh, okay, it's the Fifth Key;
that must be what it does.

585
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:04,708
It... it links us all up.

586
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:09,480
Guys, I'm sure this is important,

587
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,882
but I almost killed somebody.

588
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,684
And then somehow froze her in time.

589
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:16,987
And I'm not sure what to do next.

590
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:20,590
So just give me a sec. Hi.

591
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,693
Well, we're chained to a boat
about to go over a waterfall.

592
00:34:23,703 --> 00:34:26,596
Yeah, complete
with lacerating rocks, so...

593
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,231
Oh, shit, the Infinite Waterfall.

594
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:30,934
Not helping...
wait, you guys have magic.

595
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,243
Can you stop this boat?

596
00:34:32,254 --> 00:34:33,950
No, it's not that kind of magic.

597
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:36,740
Great, well, enjoy
our death screams, I guess.

598
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,508
Hey, everybody out of my head.

599
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:41,444
Josh... oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I think, um...

600
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,079
Look, look, we go back to Brakebills.

601
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:44,935
And then we get the Time
Key, and we reverse...

602
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:46,466
No, no, we can't go through the door.

603
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:47,485
Why?

604
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:49,452
Because we are all
listening to each other.

605
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,391
We're speaking to each other.
All eight of us. That...

606
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,582
That's what it is, it's unity. Uh...

607
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:58,928
The Quest brought us to a world
made for the Quester

608
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:01,030
who always feels left behind. The key...

609
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,601
The key needs us to work together.

610
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:04,340
- Um...
- Oh, bullshit!

611
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:09,404
You know, everything was great
until you guys got here,

612
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:11,257
- <i>so just go.</i>
- Wait, who's that?

613
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:12,973
Perfect, thank you, Penny.

614
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:15,781
You know what? Fuck the rule.

615
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:18,092
No, Josh, uh, Josh, just calm down, I...

616
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:19,554
And fuck you!

617
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,115
Wah!

618
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,957
Ah, no, no.

619
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:31,658
Okay, everybody, listen.

620
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:34,127
Um, we have to save Josh

621
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:35,662
and convince him to come back with us.

622
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:37,497
No idea what you're talking about.

623
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:39,666
All right, well, we've got
some life and death stakes

624
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,267
of our own over here.

625
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:44,471
Yes, we're all fucked
in our own way, like always.

626
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:45,839
But if we do not do this,

627
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:48,408
then the Quest is done.

628
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:51,744
Okay, we have to work together
and we have to do it now.

629
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:53,846
All right, it's gonna sound weird,

630
00:35:53,856 --> 00:35:56,183
but just go with me.
You're gonna hear music,

631
00:35:56,194 --> 00:35:58,476
and I'm gonna make sure that
everyone knows the words,

632
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:01,954
but every single one of us has to sing.

633
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,979
God, I hate you.

634
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,427
Ah, stop! Ugh, no.

635
00:36:08,437 --> 00:36:11,296

Margo fan.

702
00:39:57,926 --> 00:40:00,986
Well, he said you'd ace it.

703
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:02,254
Who said... what?

704
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:04,422
The only one I'd do this for.

705
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:07,159
To be honest, it was kind of a pain.

706
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:10,229
Nothing personal, Josh,
but after a couple of weeks,

707
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,865
I started having doubts whether
your friends would come

708
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,032
or actually be worthy.

709
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,235
Right, so this was all a test?

710
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:21,146
Everything's just a test. Right, Pen?

711
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:24,509
Penny?

712
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:27,111
- Penny, can you hear me?
- Eliot, Margo?

713
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:29,113
Wait, why can't we hear
each other anymore?

714
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:31,349
I don't mean to be rude,

715
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,918
but pigging out on Josh's dream world

716
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:36,453
has left me a little gassy.

717
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:39,556
I need a little me time at the ashram.

718
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:42,193
So...

719
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:45,562
<i>Auf Weidersen.</i> Congratulations.

720
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:48,206
<i>Schnell, schnell.</i>

721
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:58,041
You can just feel the boring.

722
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:00,685
Thank God.

723
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:06,749
Wait, where is the Truth Key?

724
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:10,153
Is it gone?

725
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:12,622
Just needed to borrow it.

726
00:41:12,632 --> 00:41:14,090
Hey, guys.

727
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:20,963
Josh. You never called me back.

728
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:23,666
The old me was a dick that way.

729
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:46,563
Really?

730
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,474
- I missed a lot, didn't I?

731
00:41:57,709 --> 00:41:58,775
Yep.
