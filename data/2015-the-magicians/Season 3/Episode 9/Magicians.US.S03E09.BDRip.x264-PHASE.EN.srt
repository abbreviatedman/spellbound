with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

If we'd known
it was a wombat judge,

182
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,685
we would've hired
a wombat lawyer.

to sound snappish,

but what part of that news
is remotely good?

189

It's an honour only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

up Fire Ant Mountain.

194
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,115
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

195
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,923
The Infinite Waterfall.
The Stone Crush.

196
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,291
Wait.

197
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,728

198
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,097
It's quite horrid, and wet.

199

Right.

200
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,837
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

201
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,068
The one with the word
"infinite“ in it.

202

210

just starve to death.

that Magician-y finger bending.

It's from German

It's a demon who creates a pocket world

and then
feeds off your happiness.

547

the Fifth Key and why?

552
