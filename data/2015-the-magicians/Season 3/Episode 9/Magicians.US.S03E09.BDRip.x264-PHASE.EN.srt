That is not, as you would say,
"a thing" in Fillory.

180

Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

181

If we'd known
it was a wombat judge,

182
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,685
we would've hired
a wombat lawyer.

to sound snappish,

188
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,708
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

189
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,772
It's an honour only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

The steep climb
up Fire Ant Mountain.

194
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,115
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

195
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,923
The Infinite Waterfall.
The Stone Crush.

196
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,291
Wait.

197
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,728
"Infinite Waterfall"?

198
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,097
It's quite horrid, and wet.

199
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,931
Right.

200
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,837
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

201
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,068

"infiniteâ€œ in it.

210

or if you're lucky,
just starve to death.

It's from German

feeds off your happiness.
