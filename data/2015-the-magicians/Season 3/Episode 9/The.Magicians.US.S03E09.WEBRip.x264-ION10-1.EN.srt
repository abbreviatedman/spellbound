1
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:07,475
- Previously on
"The Magicians..."

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,411
- Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,445
for some time.

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,550
- I demand that this
trial/peasant uprising

5
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,687
be dismissed.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,290
- Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

7
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,691
Come with me
if you want to live.

8
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,595
It has begun.

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:28,629
Sorry.

10
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,198
- Is that cocaine?

11
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,167
- It's the excretion of a very
rare magical creature.

12
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:34,568
But yes, you will
have to snort it.

13
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:35,569
- What creature?

14
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,338
- A fairy?

15
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,208
And I can't see her because
I've never made a fairy deal?

16
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,176
- My daughter's dead
because of them.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,179
- You need to talk
to Irene's fairy.

18
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,447
- My name is Skye.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,316
- Fen, what is it?
What do you see?

20
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,450
- It's her, it's Skye.

21
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,119
Oh, God,
they cut off her leg.

22
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:54,455
- That's what the powder
is made of.

23
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,458
*

24
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,394
- Weren't you supposed to
report to the Underworld

25
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,596
branch of the Library anyway?

26
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,133
- Yeah, and I burned my body
to avoid that.

27
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,867
- Did you...

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,536
Okay, come on.

29
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,872
*

30
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,175
- Alice, are you working
with the Library?

31
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,178
*

32
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:23,184
*

33
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,254
- Maybe we should've waited
at the mirror

34
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,521
for a little
while longer.

35
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,822
I mean,
maybe they survived somehow.

36
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,492
- They didn't.

37
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,393
Ask her.

38
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,499
Harriet and Victoria
were in the bridge.

39
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,635
I'm pretty sure both mirrors
shattered.

40
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,405
- Oh, my God.
No.

41
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,673
- There's your answer.

42
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,343
Where's your bag?

43
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,778
I need the Truth Key.

44
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,480
To see Penny,
if he made it back.

45
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,383
- All right.

46
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:59,353
- You found The Fourth Key?

47
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,496
- Here we go.

48
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,279
Okay.
It's in code.

49
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,949
- Mm.

50
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,818
- Be careful with that.

51
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,253
- Penny?

52
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,954
- This looks familiar.
- You know what?

53
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,756
No.

54
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,459
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

55
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,960
- I was finishing something.

56
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,630
Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

57
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,697
I needed information.

58
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,199
- Penny!

59
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,302
- Funny, 'cause there is
no magic to unify.

60
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,505
- Just let me see it again.

61
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,773
- No.

62
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,543
- I--I know what it is.

63
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,945
Music.

64
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,281
- Music?

65
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,515
- Medieval music.

66
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,488
- Here.

67
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,793
Just give it a minute, okay?

68
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,636
*

69
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,805
Sure you're playing it right?
- Yes, I'm sure.

70
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,307
- Then you're an idiot.

71
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,977
Back then the scale
didn't start at C.

72
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,813
So that's an A.

73
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,282
What?

74
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,616
- No, I just didn't know
that you had--

75
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,851
- Well, me and music
go way back.

76
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,654
It's what my mom took her
clothes off to for money.

77
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,491
And save the judgment.
She was good.

78
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:47,695
And she liked it.
And it paid for piano lessons.

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,573
*

80
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,045
- * Oh, oh, oh, oh

81
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,680
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

82
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:10,050
- What?
Where'd it go?

83
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,321
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

84
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,290
What the hell?

85
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,659
*

86
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,060
- Where did these people
come from?

87
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,929
- Who are they?

88
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:22,996
I don't recognize them.

89
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,565
- What time is it, y'all?

90
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,666
- Todd.

91
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,369
- Yeah, it's time for the one,
the only

92
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,772
King of Party O'Clock!

93
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,079
*

94
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,650
- * Can't wait for the time
when I could shed my skin *

95
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,819
* You can't read my mind,
but if you're wondering *

96
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:49,089
* I'm somebody else,
you ain't met me before *

97
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,392
* I'll put my real face on

98
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,960
* Open the door

99
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,030
* Wham, bam, here I am

100
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,032
* Demon of the glitter
and glam *

101
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,568
* Yes, catch your breath

102
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,403
* Got you eating
out of my hand *

103
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,737
* Wham, thank you, ma'am

104
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,639
* Now I'm here,
the party is on *

105
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,475
* Wow, check me out

106
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,943
* Don't know what you got
till it's gone *

107
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,713
Guys, what took you so long?

108
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,348
* Pump the beat through my
veins

109
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,117
* Ain't no stopping me now

110
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,886
* Wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am *

111
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,688
* Now I'm here,
the party is on *

112
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,356
* Wow, check us out

113
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,757
* Don't know what you got
till it's gone *

114
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,593
all: * Need it up,
Need it up *

115
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,629
- * Turn the freakin' music up,
Gone *

116
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,802
*

117
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,770
- I think we found hell.

118
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:43,844
*

119
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,390
- Whatever this is,
I don't have time.

120
00:05:56,424 --> 00:06:01,028
*

121
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,863
Where's the door?

122
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,467
Really?

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,641
*

124
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,611
All the clocks say 4:20.

125
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,480
- Well, it's not hell for Josh.

126
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,614
- Why would the book
send us here?

127
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,083
Where are we?
- Guys.

128
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,184
Great to see you.

129
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,520
Seriously, it's been too long.

130
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,922
Little word of advice,
this is a no-rules zone,

131
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,023
except one--

132
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,059
You gotta be the vibe.

133
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,162
And the vibe is fun-in-the-sun,
and you can't throw shade,

134
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,530
capisce?

135
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:40,100
- I have no idea
what you just said.

136
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,440
- Good to see you, uh...

137
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,542
Where are we, exactly?

138
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,844
And why are they doing that?

139
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,546
- Okay, guys.

140
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,781
Guys, it's okay.
It's okay, all right?

141
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,150
What Joshster was telling you,

142
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,687
it's all good in
the New World Order,

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,555
but one rule, okay?

144
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,657
Have a blast, or adios.

145
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,760
- How do we "adios," Todd?
There's no door.

146
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,963
- True, but the trade-off...

147
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,100
Is this.

148
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,702
- Holy shit.

149
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,105
- Yeah, we're not just
partying 'cause it's fun.

150
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,108
- Uh-uh.

151
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,845
*

152
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:28,115
We're tearing it up 'cause
magic is back, my babies.

153
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,251
Yeah, it is.

154
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,786
Whoo-hoo.

155
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,692
- How?
I--

156
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,895
- Two words--
who cares?

157
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:48,969
*

158
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,114
- Oh, my gosh, this feels--

159
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:08,522
*

160
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:26,106
*

161
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,051
- That bone saw,
the smith who forged it

162
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,587
must've been a monster.

163
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,189
- Fen, I did a whole line of
that fairy coke shit.

164
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,724
All right?
We've gotta help.

165
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,225
- We can't.
- Excuse me?

166
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,895
- I agreed that what's being
done to the fairies is awful,

167
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,964
but they are evil, and I told
you what they did to me,

168
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,332
my daughter.

169
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,301
And Julia, they can't
be enslaved.

170
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,669
They can do magic.

171
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,671
- Yeah,
but that was in Fillory.

172
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,640
You know,
it's obviously different here.

173
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,911
Maybe--maybe they're different.

174
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,149
And I can see them
without making a deal.

175
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,586
- How?

176
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,264
- What the fuck me hell?

177
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,966
- You've been found guilty.

178
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,068
- By a marsupial
in a wig and a robe.

179
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,638
- The judge you requested
for trial.

180
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,673
The Wombat?
- Wombat?

181
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,608
Jesus, Tick, I said combat.

182
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,309
We wanted trial by combat.

183
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,811
- That is not,
as you would say,

184
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,279
"a thing" in Fillory.

185
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,383
- Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

186
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,719
If we'd known it
was a wombat judge,

187
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,188
we would've hired
a wombat lawyer.

188
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,724
- There is some good news.

189
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,160
You are free...

190
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:57,030
to choose the manner
of your execution.

191
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,733
- Tick.

192
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,869
I don't mean to sound snappish,

193
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:05,205
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

194
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,840
- It's an honor only bestowed

195
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,276
upon the greatest
of deposed monarchs.

196
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,678
Let's see.

197
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,781
The serrated spoon----

198
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,048
Don't pick that one.

199
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,084
The steep climb up
Fire Ant Mountain.

200
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,753
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

201
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,389
The Infinite Waterfall.
The Stone Crush.

202
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,891
- Wait.

203
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,225
Infinite Waterfall?

204
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,095
- It's quite horrid, and wet.

205
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,196
- Right.

206
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:34,367
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

207
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,237
The one with the word
"infinite" in it.

208
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,438
Right?
- Right.

209
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,074
- A lot of time to...

210
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,211
- Think on our
royal sins and repent.

211
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,314
- Plan on how best to...

212
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,049
- Meet death...

213
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,284
gracefully.

214
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,986
- As desired then.

215
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,755
You will plummet
through freezing waters

216
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,223
against walls of razor rocks,

217
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,459
so you bleed out or drown,
or if you're lucky,

218
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,829
just starve to death.

219
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,230
- I really don't think
we could've picked

220
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,098
a better option.

221
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:13,406
*

222
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:17,945
- Feels really good.

223
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,013
- There's something
very wrong here.

224
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,749
None of my locator spells
are working.

225
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,016
I--I don't know where we are.

226
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,885
- How about I just blow
a hole in the wall?

227
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,088
- Sure, go ahead, but...

228
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,358
The only magic
that works here is--

229
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,893
- Party tricks.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,361
- Look, we're on the Quest.

231
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,865
So maybe there's a clue
in what we can and can't do.

232
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,834
- What we can't do is sit
around here getting blitzed

233
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,903
on never-ending scotch.

234
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,972
- It's cognac, actually.

235
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,775
- Easy.
- You, easy.

236
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,843
For all I know, this is you.
- Me?

237
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,979
- Yeah, doing shit
for your Library buddies

238
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,081
to slow us down.
- Okay, hey, you know what?

239
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,850
We're all pretty raw,
so why don't we have a drink?

240
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,924
- Wait a bit.
Wh--

241
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,826
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
take it e--

242
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,996
Ah.
No, no, no, no, no.

243
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,402
- No, no, no, no.
I'm not--

244
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,108
- * Ha--ha--happy birthday
to you *

245
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,812
* Happy birthday to you

246
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:29,850
both:
* Happy birthday, dear...

247
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:34,855
- * Fun and amazing
party hounds *

248
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:40,127
* Happy birthday to you

249
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,862
- * You

250
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,100
- There's Josh.

251
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,468
We have to figure this out now.

252
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,271
- We can't do it here.
- We gotta get him alone.

253
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,806
- I can get him upstairs.

254
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,908
Somebody has to stay here
and put on a show

255
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,444
so that they don't pick up
on any bad vibes.

256
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:01,048
- Okay.
You take the nerd.

257
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,884
I got these bozos.

258
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,887
*

259
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,262
I can thank good ol' mom.

260
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,260
- Ah.

261
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,363
- Here.
Here, I--

262
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,399
Who are you?

263
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,101
How can you see me?

264
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,602
- I'm Julia.

265
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,205
You've probably
seen me with Irene?

266
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,606
You're Skye.

267
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,075
Um, my--my friend Fen,
she told me about you,

268
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,543
about what happened
with your leg.

269
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,247
- I'm sorry,
I'm very busy.

270
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,317
- You clean their homes,
you cook their food,

271
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,419
and they take your leg
and grind it into powder

272
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,189
to snort so they can do
magic tricks.

273
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,491
I wanna help you
get out of here.

274
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,093
- No.

275
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,195
No, this is the way.

276
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,964
We can't do magic.

277
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,332
We're helpless.

278
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,034
The McAllistairs,
they protect us.

279
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,570
- No, the McAllistairs use you.
And they hurt you.

280
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,942
- Mrs. McAllistair
will be angry if I'm late.

281
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,244
- I'm told that
fairies can do magic.

282
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,082
- If that's true,
if I can show you that,

283
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,986
it proves that the McAllistairs
have lied to you.

284
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,054
About everything.

285
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,226
Meet me in the lab as soon
as you can get away.

286
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,429
Deal?

287
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:10,510
*

288
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:18,385
- * Got my new gown

289
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,686
* Got my hair--

290
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,588
- Wait.

291
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,092
Wrong key.
Try E.

292
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,160
- It's in A.

293
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,562
- We like it in E.

294
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:37,304
- That's...an excellent idea.

295
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,405
Thank you.

296
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,040
- I always felt a connection.

297
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,541
Especially when
you'd glare at me

298
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,477
like you were
trying to kill me.

299
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,046
- I always thought
you were annoying.

300
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,049
- Which turns out
to be my power move.

301
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:01,061
* Got my new gown

302
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:05,332
* Got my hair down

303
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:09,536
* All I need, oh

304
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:14,141
* Is the boy

305
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,677
* Got my silk net

306
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,049
* Got my heart set

307
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:27,220
* Got my five yards
of beaded crêpe de chine on *

308
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:32,225
* Now all I need's
a strong arm to lean on *

309
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,097
* If he'll just appear

310
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,231
*

311
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:43,203
* We'll use this big town

312
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:48,075
* For a toy

313
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,477
* And if

314
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,579
* He'll say

315
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,747
* My darling, I'm yours

316
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,117
* I'll throw away

317
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,586
* My silk nets

318
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:04,357
* Yes, and every bead

319
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:08,395
* All I really need

320
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,165
* Is the boy

321
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:19,239
*

322
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,112
- Is this a thing
you guys are into?

323
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,414
I'm not judging,
it's just a little high school.

324
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,048
- Oh, my God.

325
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,785
- Is that the book?

326
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,786
- Not here.

327
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,523
- All right, of course.
It's not even our piano.

328
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,158
It's just a part of all this.

329
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,692
- I don't know what you guys
are babbling about.

330
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,428
I had it moved up here
so I could rehearse.

331
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,662
Hence the reason
it's in my room.

332
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,097
- This isn't your room.

333
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,832
- Yeah, Josh,
you're a Naturalist.

334
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,801
This is not even your house.

335
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,570
- That's pretty much all
you know about me, right?

336
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,704
Where am I from?

337
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,373
Where'd I go to undergrad?

338
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,675
When is the last time
we actually saw each other?

339
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,844
- A couple of weeks ago?
I--

340
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,846
- Exactly.
I texted, I called.

341
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,182
Over and over, to try to get
back with you guys

342
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,316
and go on the Quest.

343
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,486
Go ahead,
check your phones.

344
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,720
I got one reply, from Julia.

345
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,422
Then nada from any of you.

346
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,592
And that's pretty much all
you think about me, right?

347
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,596
*

348
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:20,500
- * Got my new gown

349
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,404
* Got my hair down

350
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,608
* All I need now

351
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:33,346
* Is the boy

352
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,384
* Got my silk net...

353
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,686
- Ventriloquist act.
Nice trick.

354
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,489
Is that even your voice
down there?

355
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,790
Brava.

356
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,626
- You really contacted a lot.

357
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,595
- Um, uh, sorry,
we were just so--

358
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,363
- Narcissistically
up your own asses?

359
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,300
- Look, you ditched us
in Fillory, so it's not--

360
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,602
- Not the same.
That was cowardice.

361
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,404
Not indifference.

362
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,838
Look, it's fine.
It's fine.

363
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,373
Because we don't really
know each other,

364
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,608
and now we don't need to.

365
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,743
Quest is over.
Magic is back.

366
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,845
- Okay, great, well,
then just magic yourself

367
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,248
out of those ropes.

368
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,882
*

369
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,852
That is weird.

370
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,654
- Josh, I know
you're a smart guy.

371
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,256
And you want to believe
that this is real

372
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,725
because it feels so good,
but this isn't life, okay?

373
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,327
And I'm worried
the longer you stay here,

374
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,628
the less you'll want to leave.

375
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,864
- Look, he wants to stay.
Fine.

376
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:29,236
Just tell us how you got here
so we can get out.

377
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,415
- Leave us.

378
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,586
All right.

379
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,656
Good, good, good,
good, good, good, good.

380
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,324
- You pickpocketed the key?

381
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,925
- I did...

382
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,594
not.

383
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,728
- Wait till it gets dark,
that's better.

384
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,697
- Let me stop you right there.

385
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,332
I will not be helping you
escape.

386
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,001
In fact, I will not be
helping you with anything,

387
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,703
ever again.
- Wait, what?

388
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,338
- You're the worst.

389
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,541
The absolute worst rulers
Fillory has ever had.

390
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,310
- Oh, come on.
Martin Chatwin?

391
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,579
- All of you.
Children of Earth.

392
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,581
The divine prank
of Ember and Umber's.

393
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,449
And you know what's
truly infuriating?

394
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,719
How you always really believe
you have the right.

395
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,354
- Look, we didn't make
the rules here.

396
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,755
- We don't even like them.

397
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,958
- Good, as they no longer need
to be followed.

398
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,729
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

399
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,764
and I get my Kingdom back.

400
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:32,899
- Your Kingdom?

401
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,435
- I ran Fillory for years.

402
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,004
Tick.

403
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,674
Maybe we can just take a beat,
okay?

404
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,644
If there's something that
we did or didn't do,

405
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,945
or missed or fucked up,

406
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,715
don't you think
after everything

407
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,882
that we have been through,
you couldn't just,

408
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,518
I don't know,
maybe talk to us?

409
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:55,788
- I refuse to beg for what
I have waited to seize.

410
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,559
Now is the time.

411
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,995
Muntjac,

412
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,432
we are going to
the Infinite Waterfall.

413
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,367
As soon as we reach
the point of no return,

414
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,636
we'll put them in a lifeboat
and let the rapids

415
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,671
carry them over the edge.

416
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,040
And then finally have
a free Fillory

417
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,511
of, for, and by Fillorians
like us.

418
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,413
What do you say?

419
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,415
Allies?

420
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,520
- Her too?

421
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,922
Does everybody hate us?

422
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,026
- All right, you've got us
guarded and locked down here.

423
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,728
You might as well
just undo these.

424
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,398
- I shall...

425
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,868
not.

426
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,189
- How is this not
a terrible idea?

427
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,727
- Fen, whatever they did,
they don't deserve to--

428
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,865
I mean, nobody deserves to--

429
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,935
- Mrs. McAllistair is dining.

430
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,004
I have one hour.

431
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,473
- Uh.

432
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:24,911
Uh, okay, um,
we won't push too hard.

433
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:28,515
I just want to see
what you can do.

434
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,117
- So after
I couldn't find Kady,

435
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,986
I called
and called and called--

436
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,923
- Okay, we suck.
Got it.

437
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,591
Next?

438
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,728
- I went back to Bacchus'.
Party was still raging.

439
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,996
But no matter how hard
I hit the pharmaceuticals,

440
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,998
I couldn't shake the fact
that I was ditched hard

441
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,634
by you guys.

442
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,836
Which wasn't
exactly unfamiliar.

443
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,504
And, can you untie me?

444
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,106
You've made your point
and I can't feel my thumbs.

445
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,646
It's a life theme for me,
I guess.

446
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,783
You know, my brother got us
tickets to that concert.

447
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,786
Turned out to be the last one
Bowie did in the U.S.

448
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,457
- I saw it.
- It was amazing, wasn't it?

449
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,024
Is what I heard
from my brother,

450
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,893
who ditched me to take
Ann Posner.

451
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,663
And even after they got back
and told me how great it was,

452
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,565
and that Bowie went
into the middle of the crowd

453
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,832
to do "Under Pressure,"

454
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,734
I didn't feel as bad
as I should've

455
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,670
because I was just like,
"This is what happens.

456
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,505
This is what's
always gonna happen."

457
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,574
- Can we just get back to
the part of how you got here?

458
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:38,985
*

459
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,553
- Todd?
- What's up, brother?

460
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,089
- Not my dick.
I gotta crash.

461
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,558
- Hey, uh...

462
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,895
Let you in on a little secret?

463
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,667
- Get the fuck out.

464
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:58,705
Okay--one, if I'm tripping,
keep me on a molly drip.

465
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:00,640
Two, who else knows?

466
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,975
Three, how?

467
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:07,580
*

468
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,850
Ooh.
- One, you are not tripping.

469
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,086
Two, everyone
who needs to know.

470
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,756
And three...

471
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,591
- Wait, Todd has
the Fifth Key?

472
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,494
- It's one of them.
I'm not sure.

473
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,129
- Well, let's get it.

474
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,065
- Well...

475
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,100
- The key

476
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,837
isn't the key to what
we're getting up to here.

477
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,739
- Okay,
but that's pretty important.

478
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,041
I need to tell my friends.
Are they here?

479
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,944
And sorry,
but how can magic be back

480
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,546
if you have
one of the keys?

481
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,550
And why are they...

482
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,851
- Yes, we lived it.

483
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,920
Uh, have a blast or--
all: Adios.

484
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,122
- That wasn't maybe a clue
all this was fake?

485
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,725
- It's not fake.
It's just different, okay?

486
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,293
Magic comes back,
it's a little off.

487
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,763
Things always evolve.

488
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:04,937
- * For a toy

489
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:08,307
* And if he'll say

490
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,979
* My darling I'm yours,
I'll throw away *

491
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,949
* My silk net, yes

492
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,120
- Look, have you seen anybody
else you know other than Todd?

493
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,656
Have you been outside?
- I mean, these guys are great.

494
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,792
And I'll get a campus tour
as soon as--

495
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,060
- Josh, this is not Brakebills.

496
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:32,699
- And this Todd,
very un-Todd.

497
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:36,002
The real Todd isn't creepily
bossy with a prancing army

498
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,805
that turns psycho the m--

499
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:39,872
Oh, no.

500
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:45,978
*

501
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:49,281
- Okay, Josh, the quest
brought us here for a reason,

502
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,652
and it's not to party to death
for Todd's pleasure.

503
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,353
Uh--
- Wait, that's it.

504
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,123
- What's it?
- Why Todd isn't Todd.

505
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,257
I think--

506
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,692
- Shit.

507
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,095
- Okay, look, we have been
total dicks to you,

508
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,097
and I swear to you,
we are gonna make it up to you,

509
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,365
but you have
to buy us some time

510
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,867
so that we can
figure this out.

511
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,669
- Figure it out or don't,
but if you're right,

512
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,237
and this is
my own private Idaho,

513
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,012
*

514
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,684
*

515
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,818
- Let's hustle.

516
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:36,062
*

517
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,601
- Ready?

518
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,807
Okay.

519
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,976
It's okay.

520
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,210
Again.

521
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:57,149
One, two, three.

522
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,159
This is silly.

523
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,729
- Maybe you're
teaching it wrong.

524
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:14,934
I've never seen a fairy do all
that Magician-y finger bending.

525
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,035
They are magic.

526
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,704
They don't have to access it.

527
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:22,809
They just get right to
the ruining-your-life part.

528
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,211
- Okay.

529
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,080
Here.
Give me your hand.

530
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:36,723
Imagine a flower growing out
of the palm of your hand.

531
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,991
But don't picture it
in your head.

532
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,193
Picture it here.

533
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:45,231
In the real world.

534
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:52,138
- * You might not ever
get rich *

535
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,007
* But let me tell you, it's
better than digging a ditch *

536
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,744
- Wait, Todd's a what?
- A traumesser.

537
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,011
It's from German folk tales.

538
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,013
It's a demon who creates
a pocket world

539
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,015
where all your fantasies
come true,

540
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,751
and then feeds off
your happiness.

541
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,853
- So, it's a joy junkie?

542
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:10,089
- Yeah, and it created all this
to mainline Josh.

543
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,291
- Who just happens
to look like Todd?

544
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,960
- It's also a shape-shifter.

545
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,462
- But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

546
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,165
And, why would it hide it?
- I don't know.

547
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,167
It's not malevolent.
Well, for demons.

548
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,403
- Okay, so the demon
had the Fifth Key here.

549
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,105
The book brought us here,
so the--

550
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:30,009
the key is still
gotta be here, right?

551
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,079
- Ugh, boy,
not working in E.

552
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,982
- What?
- Uh, just the--the song.

553
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:40,186
Not Todd has a fetish for--
- E.

554
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,288
- The Fifth Key.
- But from A.

555
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,137
Wait, wait.
No fingers.

556
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,106
*

557
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,309
Sometimes bad shit happens.

558
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,313
Give it a sec.

559
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,381
See if it tells us what it is.

560
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,196
- Honey, you don't
have to listen to Tick.

561
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,798
You can just do your own thing.

562
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:30,236
Turn around, head home,
relax, whatevs.

563
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,177
Nothing.

564
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,247
- Maybe Tick was
right about us.

565
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,283
I mean, what really gave us
the right?

566
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:47,854
- Hey,
we didn't make the world.

567
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,857
It was baked by fucking
goat-meat nut-jobs,

568
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,424
so of course it's insane.

569
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,594
And of course we're insane for
thinking we can make it better.

570
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,463
But you know what?
- What?

571
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,331
- We did.

572
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:02,201
For a hot minute, we did.
- When?

573
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,137
- Right after you
and Idri sealed that deal.

574
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,472
- And he turned into a rat?

575
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,175
I said "one hot minute."

576
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,277
- I meant, literally one
perfect minute

577
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,546
on this god-fucked rock.

578
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,983
- And we can do it again.
We made it better.

579
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,250
I mean, come on.

580
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,852
We've pretty much
only ever had each other.

581
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:20,953
- Ugh.

582
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,589
- And that's gotten us through
pretty much everything.

583
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,624
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, everything.

584
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,126
- Everything.

585
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,396
Well, whatever happens,

586
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,300
thank you for giving us
the time where we can finally

587
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:40,239
just speak with no bullshit,
and I can just say,

588
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,275
I love you, Margo.

589
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,044
- I know.

590
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,253
- We've reached
the point of no return.

591
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:58,958
Please stop so
we can cast them off.

592
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,327
Please.
Stop.

593
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,528
Please?

594
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,333
I order you to stop,
this moment.

595
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,368
I am your king.

596
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,371
Stop right now.

597
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,528
*

598
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,132
*

599
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,968
- My first Royal Proclamation--

600
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,036
Scuttle all ships
that can think.

601
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,306
Write that down.

602
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,541
- I don't suppose
you'd stop for me?

603
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,413
Ah.

604
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:04,590
*

605
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,259
- Fuck this.

606
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,633
Holy shit.

607
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:29,415
*

608
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:47,733
*

609
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,368
- The necklace.

610
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,272
It kills them
when they use magic.

611
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,275
How could I not--
- Your eyes.

612
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,143
Julia.

613
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,445
The magic you just did.

614
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,313
You didn't use your hands.

615
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,582
How?

616
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:06,785
*

617
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,687
- I think I'm leveling up.

618
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,791
* Working at the car wash

619
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,760
* Working at the car wash,
Yeah *

620
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,295
- Whoo!

621
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,464
- * Come on down
and sing it with me *

622
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,698
* Car wash

623
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,468
*

624
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:26,572
* Car wash, yeah

625
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:30,042
*

626
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,377
- Dude, I'm new here, okay?

627
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,145
I don't know
where the coffee is.

628
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,314
I don't even know
if there is coffee here.

629
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,315
- Penny.

630
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,184
- Wait, you hear him too?
- Inside your head?

631
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,586
Yeah, me too.
- Penny, Penny!

632
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,321
- Wait, Kady?

633
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,056
- Oh, my God, Penny,
where are you?

634
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,525
- I'm--I'm in
the Underworld Library.

635
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,727
Where are you?
How am I hearing you?

636
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,596
- I don't know,
but we can all hear you.

637
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:53,065
- Yeah, can you--
can you hear all of us?

638
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,733
- Am I hallucinating?
- If you are, so am I.

639
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,068
- Um...

640
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,304
- Eliot, Margo?
- Quentin?

641
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,206
Penny?
What's going on?

642
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,841
- Uh, okay, it's the Fifth Key;
that must be what it does.

643
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,843
It--it links us all up.

644
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:09,648
- Guys, I'm sure
this is important,

645
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,184
but I almost killed somebody.

646
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,820
And then somehow
froze her in time.

647
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,256
And I'm not sure
what to do next.

648
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,759
So just give me a sec.
Hi.

649
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,829
- Well, we're chained to a boat
about to go over a waterfall.

650
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,765
- Yeah, complete
with lacerating rocks, so...

651
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,467
- Oh, shit,
the Infinite Waterfall.

652
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,237
- Not helping--
wait, you guys have magic.

653
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,638
Can you stop this boat?

654
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,173
- No, it's not that
kind of magic.

655
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,875
- Great, well, enjoy
our death screams, I guess.

656
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,677
- Hey, everybody
out of my head.

657
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,647
- Josh--oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I think, um--

658
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,349
- Look, look, we go
back to Brakebills.

659
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,117
And then we get the Time Key,
and we reverse--

660
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,552
- No, no, no, we can't go
through the door.

661
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,187
- Why?

662
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,655
- Because we are all
listening to each other.

663
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,690
We're speaking to each other.
All eight of us.

664
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,392
That--

665
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,761
That's what it is, it's unity.
Uh...

666
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,231
The Quest brought us to a world
made for the Quester

667
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,499
who always feels left behind.

668
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,267
The key--

669
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,901
The key needs us
to work together.

670
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,570
Um--
- Oh, bullshit!

671
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:09,608
You know, everything was great
until you guys got here,

672
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,610
so just go.
- Wait, who's that?

673
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,279
- Perfect, thank you, Penny.

674
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,182
You know what?
Fuck the rule.

675
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,650
- No, Josh, uh,
Josh, just calm down, I--

676
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,187
- And fuck you!

677
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,389
*

678
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,356
Wah!

679
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,859
*

680
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:30,262
Ah, no, no.

681
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,830
- Okay, everybody, listen.

682
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,400
Um, we have to save Josh

683
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:35,834
and convince him
to come back with us.

684
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,703
- No idea what
you're talking about.

685
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,838
- All right, well, we've got
some life and death stakes

686
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,507
of our own over here.

687
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,676
- Yes, we're all fucked
in our own way, like always.

688
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,178
But if we do not do this,

689
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,614
then the Quest is done.

690
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,883
Okay, we have to work together
and we have to do it now.

691
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,186
All right,
it's gonna sound weird,

692
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,187
but just go with me.

693
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,622
You're gonna hear music,

694
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,624
and I'm gonna make sure that
everyone knows the words,

695
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,261
but every single one of us
has to sing.

696
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,397
- God, I hate you.

697
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:08,634
- Ah, stop!
Ugh, no.

698
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,537
No, stop, stop!

699
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:18,610
*

700
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,215
* Mm bu ba de

701
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,916
* Um bum ba de

702
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,653
* Bu bu bum ba de de

703
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:33,225
- * Pressure
pushing down on me *

704
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:37,296
* Pressing down on you,
No man ask for *

705
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,864
- * Under pressure

706
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:43,369
* That brings a building down,
Splits a family in two *

707
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,837
both: * Puts people
on streets *

708
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,908
- * Um ba ba be,
Um ba ba be *

709
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,644
* Bi de da,
Di de da *

710
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,979
- Julia?

711
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,282
- * That's the terror
of knowing *

712
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,617
* What this world
is about *

713
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,919
both: * Watching some
good friends *

714
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,654
- * Screaming let me out

715
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:07,259
- * Pray tomorrow
gets me higher *

716
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:11,663
- * Pressure on people,
People on streets *

717
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,332
all: * De de dum

718
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,503
- * Ba da da da bum

719
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,306
* Okay

720
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,941
- * Chippin' around

721
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,976
* Kick my brains
around the floor *

722
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,515
* These are the days
it never rains but it pours *

723
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,283
all: * Ee doo doe de ma

724
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,685

00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,955
* Do bum,

726
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,890
* People on streets

00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,059
* Ee da dee da deh

728
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,928
* People on streets

729
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,896
* Ee da dee da dee da dee da

730
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,800
- * It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about *

731
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,737
all: * Watching some
good friends *

732
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,972
* Screaming let me out

733
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,975
- * Pray tomorrow

734
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,710
* Higher high

735
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,747
* Pressure on people,
People on streets *

736
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,516
- God damn it, Penny.

737
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,321
- * Turned away from it all
like a blind man *

738
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:13,091
* Sat on a fence
but it don't work *

739
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,726
both: * Keep coming up
with love *

740
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,396
* But it's so
slashed and torn *

741
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,997
all: * Why

742
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,335
* Why, Why

743
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:28,474
*

744
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:31,843
* Love love love love love

745
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:36,114
* Insanity laughs
under pressure we're cracking *

746
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,518
* Can't we give ourselves
one more chance *

747
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:43,855
* Why can't we give love
that one more chance *

748
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,626
* Why can't we give love
Give love give love *

749
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,029
* Give love give love,
Give love *

750
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,731
* Give love give love

751
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:57,903
- * 'Cause love's such
an old-fashioned word *

752
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,939
* And love dares you

753
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,074
* To care for

754
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,644
all: * The people on the

755
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,814
* Edge of the night

756
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,483
* And love dares you

757
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,386
* To change our way of

758
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,524
* Caring about ourselves

759
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:22,394
* This is our last dance

760
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:26,665
* This is our last dance

761
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,001
* This is ourselves

762
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,803
* Under pressure

763
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:34,606
*

764
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,775
* Under pressure

765
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,177
*

766
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,646
* Pressure

767
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,882
*

768
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,927
- Bowie fan?

769
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,096
- Margo fan.

770
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,132
- Well, he said you'd ace it.

771
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,568
- Who said--what?

772
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,703
- The only one I'd do this for.

773
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,473
To be honest,
it was kind of a pain.

774
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:10,542
Nothing personal, Josh,
but after a couple of weeks,

775
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,044
I started having doubts whether
your friends would come

776
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,180
or actually be worthy.

777
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,549
- Right, so this was
all a test?

778
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,487
- Everything's just a test.
Right, Pen?

779
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,756
Penny?

780
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,459
Penny, can you hear me?
- Eliot, Margo?

781
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,461
Wait, why can't we hear
each other anymore?

782
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,630
- I don't mean to be rude,

783
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,099
but pigging out on
Josh's dream world

784
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,735
has left me
a little gassy.

785
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,805
I need a little me time
at the ashram.

786
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,508
So...

787
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:45,811
Auf Weidersen.
Congratulations.

788
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:48,547
Schnell, schnell.

789
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,189
- You can just feel
the boring.

790
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:00,926
Thank God.

791
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,965
- Wait, where is the Truth Key?

792
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:10,502
- Is it gone?

793
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:12,871
- Just needed to borrow it.

794
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,239
Hey, guys.

795
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,774
Phew.

796
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,146
Josh.
You never called me back.

797
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,915
- The old me was
a dick that way.

798
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,838
- Really?

799
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,949
- I missed a lot, didn't I?

800
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,017
- Yep.
