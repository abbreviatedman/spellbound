00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>Previously on "The Magicians..."</i>

2
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:05,724
Children of Earth have been making a
mess of things here for some time.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:14,025
I demand that this trial/peasant
uprising be dismissed.

4
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:16,527
Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

5
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,029
Come with me if you want to live.

6
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,899
It has begun.

7
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:22,933
Sorry.

8
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:24,401
Is that cocaine?

9
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,371
It's the excretion of a very
rare magical creature.

10
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,159
But yes, you will have to snort it.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,936
- What creature?
- A fairy?

12
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,411
And I can't see her because
I've never made a fairy deal?

13
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:36,380
My daughter's dead because of them.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,382
You need to talk to Irene's fairy.

15
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,717
My name is Skye.

16
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:42,552
Fen, what is it? What do you see?

17
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:43,720
It's her, it's Skye.

18
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,288
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

19
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:48,725
<i>That's what the powder is made of.</i>

20
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,383
_

21
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:51,727
_

22
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:54,630
Weren't you supposed to
report to the Underworld

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,899
<i>branch of the Library anyway?</i>

24
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,301
Yeah, and I burned my body
to avoid that.

25
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,237
Did you...

26
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:02,805
Okay, come on.

27
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:08,344
Alice, are you working with the Library?

28
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,908
Maybe we should've waited at the
mirror for a little while longer.

29
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,227
- I mean, maybe they survived somehow.
- They didn't.

30
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:27,333
Ask her.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,767
Harriet and Victoria were in the bridge.

32
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:35,274
I'm pretty sure both mirrors shattered.

33
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:38,157
Oh, my God. No.

34
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,950
There's your answer.

35
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:43,570
Where's your bag?

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,113
I need the Truth Key.

37
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:46,714
To see Penny, if he made it back.

38
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,387
All right.

39
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:52,594
You found The Fourth Key?

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,738
Here we go.

41
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,373
Okay. It's in code.

42
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,152
Be careful with that.

43
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:26,420
Penny?

44
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,322
- This looks familiar.
- You know what?

45
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,555
No.

46
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:32,692
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

47
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,328
I was finishing something.

48
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,896
Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

49
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,177
I needed information.

50
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,365
Penny!

51
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,502
Funny, 'cause there is
no magic to unify.

52
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:44,313
Just let me see it again.

53
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,073
No.

54
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,055
I... I know what it is.

55
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:51,540
Music.

56
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,727
Music?

57
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:55,722
Medieval music.

58
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,695
Here.

59
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,067
Just give it a minute, okay?

60
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:19,247
- Sure you're playing it right?
- Yes, I'm sure.

61
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,669
Then you're an idiot.

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,696
Back then the scale didn't start at C.

63
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,112
So that's an A.

64
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,446
What?

65
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,319
No, I just didn't know that you had...

66
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,150
Well, me and music go way back.

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,919
It's what my mom took her
clothes off to for money.

68
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:37,722
And save the judgment. She was good.

69
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:41,934
And she liked it.
And it paid for piano lessons.

70
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,532
What? Where'd it go?

71
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,899
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

72
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:09,227
What the hell?

73
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,560
Where did these people come from?

74
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,259
Who are they?

75
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,718
- I don't recognize them.
- What time is it, y'all?

76
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:19,746
Todd.

77
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:22,532
Yeah, it's time for the one, the only

Where are we?

109
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:17,410
Guys.

110
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,545
Great to see you.

111
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,713
Seriously, it's been too long.

112
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:23,216
Little word of advice,
this is a no-rules zone,

113
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,317
except one...

114
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,385
You gotta be the vibe.

115
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:30,723
And the vibe is fun-in-the-sun, and
you can't throw shade, capisce?

116
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,989
I have no idea what you just said.

117
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:40,599
Good to see you, uh...

118
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,734
Where are we, exactly?

119
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:45,103
And why are they doing that?

120
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,738
Okay, guys.

121
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:49,241
Guys, it's okay. It's okay, all right?

122
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,900
What Joshster was telling you,

123
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,912
it's all good in the New World Order,

124
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:55,747
but one rule, okay?

125
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,849
Have a blast, or adios.

126
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:00,985
How do we "adios," Todd?
There's no door.

127
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:04,255
True, but the trade-off...

128
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:07,425
Is this.

129
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,927
Holy shit.

130
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:12,430
Yeah, we're not just
partying 'cause it's fun.

131
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:22,440
We're tearing it up 'cause
magic is back, my babies.

132
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,610
Yeah, it is.

133
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,985
Whoo-hoo.

134
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:32,883
How? I...

135
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:35,673
Two words... who cares?

136
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:55,405
Oh, my gosh, this feels...

137
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:32,433
That bone saw, the smith who forged it

138
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:33,742
must've been a monster.

139
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,890
Fen, I did a whole line of
that fairy coke shit.

140
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,292
All right? We've gotta help.

141
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:39,547
- We can't.
- Excuse me?

142
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:42,117
I agreed that what's being
done to the fairies is awful,

143
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,220
but they are evil, and I told
you what they did to me,

144
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,688
my daughter.

145
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,623
And Julia, they can't be enslaved.

146
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,858
They can do magic.

147
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah, but that was in Fillory.

148
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,795
You know, it's obviously different here.

149
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:58,140
Maybe... maybe they're different.

150
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,438
And I can see them
without making a deal.

151
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:06,716
How?

152
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,585
What the fuck me hell?

153
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:20,221
You've been found guilty.

154
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:22,323
By a marsupial in a wig and a robe.

155
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,791
The judge you requested for trial.

156
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,827
- The Wombat?
- Wombat?

157
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:28,762
Jesus, Tick, I said combat.

158
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,630
We wanted trial by combat.

159
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,998
That is not, as you would say,

160
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,600
"a thing" in Fillory.

161
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,738
Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

162
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:39,906
If we'd known it was a wombat judge,

163
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,476
we would've hired a wombat lawyer.

164
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,911
There is some good news.

165
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:46,897
You are free...

166
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:51,259
to choose the manner of your execution.

167
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,919
Tick.

168
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,089
I don't mean to sound snappish,

169
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:59,492
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

170
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:03,596
It's an honor only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

171
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:04,805
Let's see.

172
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,966
The serrated spoon......

173
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,301
Don't pick that one.

174
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,336
The steep climb up Fire Ant Mountain.

175
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:13,939
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

176
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,709
The Infinite Waterfall. The Stone Crush.

177
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,110
Wait.

178
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,511
Infinite Waterfall?

179
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:22,347
It's quite horrid, and wet.

180
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,448
Right.

181
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,686
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

182
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,523
The one with the word "infinite" in it.

183
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,791
- Right?
- Right.

184
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,326
A lot of time to...

185
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:38,496
Think on our royal sins and repent.

186
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,633
Plan on how best to...

187
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,301
Meet death...

188
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,570
gracefully.

189
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,204
As desired then.

190
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,907
You will plummet through freezing waters

191
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,507
against walls of razor rocks,

192
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,811
so you bleed out or drown,
or if you're lucky,

193
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,013
just starve to death.

194
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,350
I really don't think we could've
picked a better option.

195
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,576
Feels really good.

196
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,230
There's something very wrong here.

197
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,899
None of my locator spells are working.

198
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,233
I... I don't know where we are.

199
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,069
How about I just blow
a hole in the wall?

200
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,313
Sure, go ahead, but...

201
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,790
The only magic that works here is...

202
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,368
- Party tricks.
- Yeah.

203
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:28,915
Look, we're on the Quest.

204
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:32,048
So maybe there's a clue
in what we can and can't do.

205
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,018
What we can't do is sit
around here getting blitzed

206
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,087
on never-ending scotch.

207
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,189
It's cognac, actually.

208
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,924
- Easy.
- You, easy.

209
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,026
- For all I know, this is you.
- Me?

210
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,195
Yeah, doing shit
for your Library buddies

211
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,297
- to slow us down.
- Okay, hey, you know what?

212
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,033
We're all pretty raw,
so why don't we have a drink?

213
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,107
Wait a bit. Wh...

214
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it e...

215
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,212
Ah. No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,960
No, no, no, no. I'm not...

217
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:14,430

218
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:18,067

223
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,423
There's Josh.

224
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:42,592
We have to figure this out now.

225
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,193
- We can't do it here.
- We gotta get him alone.

226
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:46,596
I can get him upstairs.

227
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:48,913
Somebody has to stay here
and put on a show

228
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:51,583
so that they don't pick up
on any bad vibes.

229
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:55,087
Okay. You take the nerd.

230
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:57,889
I got these bozos.

231
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:09,342
I can thank good ol' mom.

232
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:44,467
Here. Here, I...

233
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:46,503
Who are you?

234
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:48,138
How can you see me?

235
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,773
I'm Julia.

236
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:52,275
You've probably seen me with Irene?

237
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:53,777
You're Skye.

238
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,112
Um, my... my friend Fen,
she told me about you,

239
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:57,680
about what happened with your leg.

240
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,317
I'm sorry, I'm very busy.

241
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,420
You clean their homes,
you cook their food,

242
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,522
and they take your leg
and grind it into powder

243
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:10,259
to snort so they can do magic tricks.

244
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:12,628
I wanna help you get out of here.

245
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,129
No.

246
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,265
No, this is the way.

247
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,966
We can't do magic.

248
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:19,435
We're helpless.

249
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:21,036
The McAllistairs, they protect us.

250
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:24,706
No, the McAllistairs use you.
And they hurt you.

251
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:28,944
Mrs. McAllistair
will be angry if I'm late.

252
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:31,313
I'm told that fairies can do magic.

253
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:36,118
If that's true, if I can show you that,

254
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:39,987
it proves that the McAllistairs
have lied to you.

255
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,063
About everything.

256
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:47,295
Meet me in the lab as soon
as you can get away.

257
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:50,506
Deal?

258
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:12,486

259

260
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:15,723
Wait.

261
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,982
Wrong key. Try E.

262
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:21,194
It's in A.

263
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,697
We like it in E.

264
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:31,371
That's... an excellent idea.

265
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:32,505
Thank you.

266
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,040
I always felt a connection.

267
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,578
Especially when you'd glare at me
like you were trying to kill me.

268
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,046
I always thought you were annoying.

269
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:43,049
Which turns out to be my power move.

270
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,958

Is this a thing you guys are into?

291
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,744
I'm not judging,
it's just a little high school.

292
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:22,287
Oh, my God.

293
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,216
Is that the book?

294
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:27,347
Not here.

295
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,887
All right, of course.
It's not even our piano.

296
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:31,421
It's just a part of all this.

297
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:33,243
I don't know what you
guys are babbling about.

298
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:35,076
I had it moved up here
so I could rehearse.

299
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,396
Hence the reason it's in my room.

300
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:37,725
This isn't your room.

301
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:41,907
Yeah, Josh, you're a Naturalist.
This is not even your house.

302
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,377
That's pretty much all you
know about me, right?

303
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:45,468
Where am I from?

304
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,069
Where'd I go to undergrad?

305
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,438
When is the last time
we actually saw each other?

306
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:51,639
A couple of weeks ago? I...

307
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:53,641
Exactly. I texted, I called.

308
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,810
Over and over, to try to get
back with you guys

309
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,979
and go on the Quest.

310
00:17:56,989 --> 00:18:00,215
Go ahead, check your phones.

311
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,483
I got one reply, from Julia.

312
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:03,118
Then Nada from any of you.

313
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:06,320
And that's pretty much all
you think about me, right?

Ventriloquist act. Nice trick.

320
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:36,183
Is that even your voice down there?

321
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:37,584
<i>Brava.</i>

322
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:40,353
You really contacted a lot.

323
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:42,322
Um, uh, sorry, we were just so...

324
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,024
Narcissistically up your own asses?

325
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:46,960
Look, you ditched us
in Fillory, so it's not...

326
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,329
Not the same. That was cowardice.

327
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,097
Not indifference.

328
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,633
Look, it's fine. It's fine.

329
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:55,335
Because we don't really know each
other, and now we don't need to.

330
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,504
Quest is over. Magic is back.

331
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,639
Okay, great, well,
then just magic yourself

332
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,874
out of those ropes.

333
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:06,646
That is weird.

334
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,527
Josh, I know you're a smart guy.

335
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,176
And you want to believe
that this is real

336
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:12,484
because it feels so good,
but this isn't life, okay?

337
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:15,354
And I'm worried the longer you stay
here, the less you'll want to leave.

338
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:18,658
Look, he wants to stay. Fine.

339
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:22,862
Just tell us how you got here
so we can get out.

340
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,075
Leave us.

341
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,312
All right.

342
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:43,382
Good, good, good,
good, good, good, good.

343
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,983
You pickpocketed the key?

344
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:46,633
I did...

345
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,719
not.

346
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,583
Wait till it gets dark, that's better.

347
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:51,422
Let me stop you right there.

348
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:52,991
I will not be helping you escape.

349
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:55,827
In fact, I will not be
helping you with anything,

350
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:57,754
- ever again.
- Wait, what?

351
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:58,997
You're the worst.

352
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,233
The absolute worst rulers
Fillory has ever had.

353
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,987
Oh, come on. Martin Chatwin?

354
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,270
All of you. Children of Earth.

355
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,272
The divine prank of Ember and Umber's.

356
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,108
And you know what's truly infuriating?

357
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:13,444
How you always really believe
you have the right.

358
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:15,012
Look, we didn't make the rules here.

359
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:16,514
We don't even like them.

360
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:19,750
Good, as they no longer need
to be followed.

361
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,453
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

362
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:25,522
and I get my Kingdom back.

363
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:26,690
Your Kingdom?

364
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,093
I ran Fillory for years.

365
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,795
Tick.

366
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,398
Maybe we can just take a beat, okay?

367
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,368
If there's something that
we did or didn't do,

368
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,736
or missed or fucked up,

369
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,252
don't you think after everything

370
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:43,929
that we have been through,
you couldn't just,

371
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,208
I don't know, maybe talk to us?

372
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:49,521
I refuse to beg for what
I have waited to seize.

373
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,249
Now is the time.

374
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,786
Muntjac,

375
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:59,088
we are going to the Infinite Waterfall.

376
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:00,990
As soon as we reach
the point of no return,

377
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,325
we'll put them in a lifeboat
and let the rapids

378
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,394
carry them over the edge.

379
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:07,829
And then finally have a free Fillory

380
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,168
of, for, and by Fillorians like us.

381
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,069
What do you say?

382
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,071
Allies?

383
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,177
Her too?

384
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:23,679
Does everybody hate us?

385
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:27,816
All right, you've got us
guarded and locked down here.

386
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,450
You might as well just undo these.

387
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,989
I shall...

388
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,895
not.

389
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:40,136
Okay, the "not" thing is kind of arch.

390
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,919
How is this not a terrible idea?

391
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,955
Fen, whatever they did,
they don't deserve to...

392
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:05,167
I mean, nobody deserves to...

393
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:08,270
Mrs. McAllistair is dining.

394
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,339
I have one hour.

395
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:17,212
Uh, okay, um, we won't push too hard.

396
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:20,716
I just want to see what you can do.

397
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:23,485
So after I couldn't find Kady,

398
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:26,321
I called and called and called...

399
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:29,224
Okay, we suck. Got it.

400
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,826
Next?

401
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:33,995
I went back to Bacchus'.
Party was still raging.

402
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:36,331
<i>But no matter how hard
I hit the pharmaceuticals,</i>

403
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,333
<i>I couldn't shake the fact
that I was ditched hard</i>

404
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:39,867
by you guys.

405
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:42,137
Which wasn't exactly unfamiliar.

406
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,704
And, can you untie me?

407
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:46,474
You've made your point
and I can't feel my thumbs.

408
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:51,879
It's a life theme for me, I guess.

409
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:56,050
You know, my brother got us
tickets to that concert.

410
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,053
Turned out to be the last one
Bowie did in the U.S.

411
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:02,657
- I saw it.
- It was amazing, wasn't it?

412
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,358
Is what I heard from my brother,

413
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:06,193
who ditched me to take Ann Posner.

414
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:08,895
And even after they got back
and told me how great it was,

415
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,764
and that Bowie went
into the middle of the crowd

416
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,098
to do "Under Pressure,"

417
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:14,000
I didn't feel as bad as I should've

418
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,902
because I was just like,
"This is what happens.

419
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:17,859
This is what's always gonna happen."

420
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,425
Can we just get back to the
part of how you got here?

421
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,752
- Todd?
- What's up, brother?

422
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:35,421
Not my dick. I gotta crash.

423
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:37,757
Hey, uh...

424
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:41,194
Let you in on a little secret?

425
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,899
Get the fuck out.

426
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,936
Okay... one, if I'm tripping,
keep me on a molly drip.

427
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:52,871
Two, who else knows?

428
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,273
Three, how?

429
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,115
- Ooh.
- One, you are not tripping.

430
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,418
Two, everyone who needs to know.

431
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,987
And three...

432
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,789
<i>Wait, Todd has the Fifth Key?</i>

433
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,658
It's one of them. I'm not sure.

434
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,460
Well, let's get it.

435
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,396
Well...

436
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,432
The key

437
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:23,101
isn't the key to what
we're getting up to here.

438
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:24,969
Okay, but that's pretty important.

439
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,339
I need to tell my friends.
Are they here?

440
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:30,241
And sorry, but how can magic be back

441
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,743
if you have one of the keys?

442
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:35,747
And why are they...

443
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,115
Yes, we lived it.

444
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,184
Uh, have a blast or... all: Adios.

445
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:42,453
That wasn't maybe a clue
all this was fake?

446
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:44,955
It's not fake.
It's just different, okay?

447
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:46,657
Magic comes back, it's a little off.

448
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,992

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,671

Look, have you seen anybody
else you know other than Todd?

454
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,852
- Have you been outside?
- I mean, these guys are great.

455
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,020
And I'll get a campus tour as soon as...

456
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,356
Josh, this is not Brakebills.

457
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:24,894
And this Todd, very un-Todd.

458
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:28,298
The real Todd isn't creepily
bossy with a prancing army

459
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:31,033
that turns psycho the m...

460
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,109
Oh, no.

461
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:41,643
Okay, Josh, the quest
brought us here for a reason,

462
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,847
and it's not to party to death
for Todd's pleasure.

463
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,715
Wait, that's it.

464
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,418
- What's it?
- Why Todd isn't Todd.

465
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:50,585
I think...

466
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:51,861
Shit.

467
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:55,390
Okay, look, we have been
total dicks to you,

468
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,553
and I swear to you,
we are gonna make it up to you,

469
00:25:57,564 --> 00:26:00,460
but you have to buy us some time
so that we can figure this out.

470
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,230
Figure it out or don't,
but if you're right,

471
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,932
and this is my own private Idaho,

472
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,408
I want you out of it.

473
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,699
Let's hustle.

474
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:33,623
Ready?

475
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,687
Okay.

476
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:41,110
It's okay.

477
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:43,165
Again.

478
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:47,969
One, two, three.

479
00:26:55,512 --> 00:26:59,139
This is silly.

480
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:01,156
Maybe you're teaching it wrong.

481
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:06,847
I've never seen a fairy do all
that Magician-y finger bending.

482
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:07,981
They are magic.

483
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:09,550
They don't have to access it.

484
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,672
They just get right to
the ruining-your-life part.

485
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,190
Okay.

486
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,001
Here. Give me your hand.

487
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:28,568
Imagine a flower growing out
of the palm of your hand.

488
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:30,903
But don't picture it in your head.

489
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:33,172
Picture it here.

490
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:37,184
In the real world.

491
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:44,083
♪ You might not ever get rich ♪

492
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:46,919

493
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:49,588
- Wait, Todd's a what?
- A traumesser.

494
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:50,922
It's from German folk tales.

495
00:27:50,932 --> 00:27:52,924
It's a demon who creates a pocket world

496
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:54,926
where all your fantasies come true,

497
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,595
and then feeds off your happiness.

498
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:58,730
So, it's a joy junkie?

499
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,033
Yeah, and it created all this
to mainline Josh.

500
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:04,269
Who just happens to look like Todd?

501
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,870
It's also a shape-shifter.

502
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,472
But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

503
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:11,109
- And, why would it hide it?
- I don't know.

504
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,111
It's not malevolent. Well, for demons.

505
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:16,414
Okay, so the demon
had the Fifth Key here.

506
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:18,049
The book brought us here, so the...

507
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,919
the key is still gotta be here, right?

508
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:24,988
Ugh, boy, not working in E.

509
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:27,892
- What?
- Uh, just the... the song.

510
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:32,129
- Not Todd has a fetish for...
- E.

511
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:34,239
- The Fifth Key.
- But from A.

512
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:49,389
Wait, wait. No fingers.

513
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:55,284
Sometimes bad shit happens.

514
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,288
Give it a sec.

515
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:01,365
See if it tells us what it is.

516
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,138
Honey, you don't have to listen to Tick.

517
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:17,639
You can just do your own thing.

518
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:21,764
Turn around, head home, relax, whatevs.

519
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:30,117
Nothing.

520
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:32,748
Maybe Tick was right about us.

521
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:36,224
I mean, what really gave us the right?

522
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,695
Hey, we didn't make the world.

523
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:42,698
It was baked by fucking
goat-meat nut-jobs,

524
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,399
so of course it's insane.

525
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,635
And of course we're insane for
thinking we can make it better.

526
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:49,471
- But you know what?
- What?

527
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,306
We did.

528
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:54,142
- For a hot minute, we did.
- When?

529
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:57,045
Right after you
and Idri sealed that deal.

530
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:58,480
And he turned into a rat?

531
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,081
I said "one hot minute."

532
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,217
I meant, literally one perfect minute

533
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:06,554
on this god-fucked rock.

534
00:30:06,564 --> 00:30:08,856
And we can do it again.
We made it better.

535
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,190
I mean, come on.

536
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,220
We've pretty much
only ever had each other.

537
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:15,596
And that's gotten us through
pretty much everything.

538
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,664
I mean, everything.

539
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:19,033
Everything.

540
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:22,369
Well, whatever happens,

541
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:26,240
thank you for giving us
the time where we can finally

542
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:32,179
just speak with no bullshit,
and I can just say,

543
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:35,214
I love you, Margo.

544
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,917
I know.

545
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:46,192
We've reached the point of no return.

546
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:49,220
Please stop so we can cast them off.

547
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:53,266
Please. Stop.

548
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:54,508
Please?

549
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:59,272
I order you to stop, this moment.

550
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:01,307
I am your king.

551
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,595
Stop right now.

552
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:33,923
My first Royal Proclamation...

553
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,907
Scuttle all ships that can think.

554
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,591
Write that down.

555
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:41,520
I don't suppose you'd stop for me?

556
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:59,163
Fuck this.

557
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:06,612
Holy shit.

558
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:41,031
The necklace.

559
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:44,773
It kills them when they use magic.

560
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:47,776
- How could I not...
- Your eyes.

561
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:51,013
Julia. The magic you just did.

562
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:52,683
You didn't use your hands.

563
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:54,301
How?

564
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,288
I think I'm leveling up.

572
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:27,925
Penny.

573
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:30,273
- Wait, you hear him too?
- Inside your head? Yeah, me too.

574
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:32,153
Penny, Penny!

575
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:33,821
Wait, Kady?

576
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,489
Oh, my God, Penny, where are you?

577
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:38,092
I'm... I'm in the Underworld Library.

578
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:40,327
Where are you? How am I hearing you?

579
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:42,162
I don't know, but we can all hear you.

580
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:44,498
Yeah, can you... can you hear all of us?

581
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:46,333
- Am I hallucinating?
- If you are, so am I.

582
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:47,501
Um...

583
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,803
- Eliot, Margo?
- Quentin?

584
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:51,672
Penny? What's going on?

585
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:54,475
Uh, okay, it's the Fifth Key;
that must be what it does.

586
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:56,476
It... it links us all up.

587
00:33:56,486 --> 00:34:01,248
Guys, I'm sure this is important,

588
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:03,650
but I almost killed somebody.

589
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,452
And then somehow froze her in time.

590
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,755
And I'm not sure what to do next.

591
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:12,358
So just give me a sec. Hi.

592
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:15,461
Well, we're chained to a boat
about to go over a waterfall.

593
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:18,364
Yeah, complete
with lacerating rocks, so...

594
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:19,999
Oh, shit, the Infinite Waterfall.

595
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,702
Not helping...
wait, you guys have magic.

596
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:24,011
Can you stop this boat?

597
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,718
No, it's not that kind of magic.

598
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,508
Great, well, enjoy
our death screams, I guess.

599
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,276
Hey, everybody out of my head.

600
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:33,212
Josh... oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I think, um...

601
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:34,847
Look, look, we go back to Brakebills.

602
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,703
And then we get the Time
Key, and we reverse...

603
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,234
No, no, we can't go through the door.

604
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,253
Why?

605
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,220
Because we are all
listening to each other.

606
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,159
We're speaking to each other.
All eight of us. That...

607
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,350
That's what it is, it's unity. Uh...

608
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:50,696
The Quest brought us to a world
made for the Quester

609
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,798
who always feels left behind. The key...

610
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,369
The key needs us to work together.

611
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,108
- Um...
- Oh, bullshit!

612
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,172
You know, everything was great
until you guys got here,

613
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,025
- <i>so just go.</i>
- Wait, who's that?

614
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,741
Perfect, thank you, Penny.

615
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:07,549
You know what? Fuck the rule.

616
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,860
No, Josh, uh, Josh, just calm down, I...

617
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:11,322
And fuck you!

618
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:15,883
Wah!

619
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:21,725
Ah, no, no.

620
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:23,426
Okay, everybody, listen.

621
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,895
Um, we have to save Josh

622
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:27,430
and convince him to come back with us.

623
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,265
No idea what you're talking about.

624
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:31,434
All right, well, we've got
some life and death stakes

625
00:35:31,444 --> 00:35:33,035
of our own over here.

626
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:36,239
Yes, we're all fucked
in our own way, like always.

627
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:37,607
But if we do not do this,

628
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:40,176
then the Quest is done.

629
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:43,512
Okay, we have to work together
and we have to do it now.

630
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:45,614
All right, it's gonna sound weird,

631
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,951
but just go with me.
You're gonna hear music,

632
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:50,244
and I'm gonna make sure that
everyone knows the words,

633
00:35:50,255 --> 00:35:53,722
but every single one of us has to sing.

634
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:56,747
God, I hate you.

635
00:35:56,758 --> 00:36:00,195
Ah, stop! Ugh, no.

636
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:03,064

703
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:52,754
Well, he said you'd ace it.

704
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,022
Who said... what?

705
00:39:54,032 --> 00:39:56,190
The only one I'd do this for.

706
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,927
To be honest, it was kind of a pain.

707
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,997
Nothing personal, Josh,
but after a couple of weeks,

708
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:04,633
I started having doubts whether
your friends would come

709
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,800
or actually be worthy.

710
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,003
Right, so this was all a test?

711
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:12,914
Everything's just a test. Right, Pen?

712
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:16,277
Penny?

713
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:18,879
- Penny, can you hear me?
- Eliot, Margo?

714
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:20,881
Wait, why can't we hear
each other anymore?

715
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:23,117
I don't mean to be rude,

716
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:25,686
but pigging out on Josh's dream world

717
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:28,221
has left me a little gassy.

718
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:31,324
I need a little me time at the ashram.

719
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:33,961
So...

720
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:37,330
<i>Auf Weidersen.</i> Congratulations.

721
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,974
<i>Schnell, schnell.</i>

722
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:49,809
You can just feel the boring.

723
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:52,453
Thank God.

724
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:58,517
Wait, where is the Truth Key?

725
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:01,921
Is it gone?

726
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:04,390
Just needed to borrow it.

727
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,858
Hey, guys.

728
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,731
Josh. You never called me back.

729
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:15,434
The old me was a dick that way.

730
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,331
Really?

- I missed a lot, didn't I?

733
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:50,543
Yep.
