14

rare magical creature.

But yes, you will
have to snort it.

17

- A fairy?

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,208
And I can't see her because
I've never made a fairy deal?

19
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,176

because of them.

to Irene's fairy.

What do you see?

Oh, God,
they cut off her leg.

to avoid that.

Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

no magic to unify.

Back then the scale
didn't start at C.

So that's an A.

- Well, me and music
go way back.

It's what my mom took her
clothes off to for money.

She was good.

00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,895
- I agreed that what's being
done to the fairies is awful,

185
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,964
but they are evil, and I told
you what they did to me,

186
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,332
my daughter.

187
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,301
And Julia, they can't
be enslaved.

188
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,669
They can do magic.

189
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,671
- Yeah,
but that was in Fillory.

190
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,640
You know,
it's obviously different here.

191
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,911
Maybe--maybe they're different.

192
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,149
And I can see them
without making a deal.

193
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,586

- You've been found guilty.

198
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,068
- By a marsupial
in a wig and a robe.

199
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,638
- The judge you requested
for trial.

200
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,673
The Wombat?
- Wombat?

201
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,608
Jesus, Tick, I said combat.

202
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,309
We wanted trial by combat.

203
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,811
- That is not,
as you would say,

204
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,279
"a thing" in Fillory.

205
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,383
- Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

206
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,719
If we'd known it
was a wombat judge,

207
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,188
we would've hired
a wombat lawyer.

208
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,724
- There is some good news.

209
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,160
You are free...

210
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:57,030
to choose the manner
of your execution.

211
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,733
- Tick.

212

I don't mean to sound snappish,

213
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:05,205
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

214
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,840
- It's an honor only bestowed

215
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,276
upon the greatest
of deposed monarchs.

216
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,678

Fire Ant Mountain.

the serrated spoon first.

The Stone Crush.

But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

227
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,237
The one with the word
"infinite" in it.

228
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,438
Right?
- Right.

229
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,074
- A lot of time to...

230
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,211
- Think on our
royal sins and repent.

231
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,314
- Plan on how best to...

232
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,049

- As desired then.

235
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,755
You will plummet
through freezing waters

against walls of razor rocks,

237
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,459

or if you're lucky,

a hole in the wall?

- Sure, go ahead, but...

250

The only magic
that works here is--

- Party tricks.
- Yeah.

252

- Look, we're on the Quest.

253
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,865
So maybe there's a clue
in what we can and can't do.

254
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,834

around here getting blitzed

and grind it into powder

00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,786
- Not here.

364
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,523
- All right, of course.
It's not even our piano.

365
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,158
It's just a part of all this.

366
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,692
- I don't know what you guys
are babbling about.

367
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,428
I had it moved up here
so I could rehearse.

368
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,662
Hence the reason
it's in my room.

369
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,097
- This isn't your room.

370
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,832
- Yeah, Josh,
you're a Naturalist.

371
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,801
This is not even your house.

372
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,570
- That's pretty much all
you know about me, right?

373
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,704
Where am I from?

374
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,373
Where'd I go to undergrad?

375
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,675
When is the last time
we actually saw each other?

376
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,844
- A couple of weeks ago?
I--

377
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,846
- Exactly.
I texted, I called.

378
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,182
Over and over, to try to get
back with you guys

379
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,316
and go on the Quest.

380
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,486
Go ahead,
check your phones.

381
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,720
I got one reply, from Julia.

382
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,422
Then nada from any of you.

383
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,592
And that's pretty much all
you think about me, right?

00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,608
* All I need now

388
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:33,346
* Is the boy

389
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,384
* Got my silk net...

390
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,686
- Ventriloquist act.
Nice trick.

391
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,489
Is that even your voice
down there?

392
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,790
Brava.

393
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,626
- You really contacted a lot.

394
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,595
- Um, uh, sorry,
we were just so--

395
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,363
- Narcissistically
up your own asses?

396
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,300
- Look, you ditched us
in Fillory, so it's not--

397
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,602
- Not the same.
That was cowardice.

398
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,404
Not indifference.

399
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,838
Look, it's fine.
It's fine.

400
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,373
Because we don't really
know each other,

401
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,608
and now we don't need to.

402
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,743
Quest is over.
Magic is back.

403
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,845
- Okay, great, well,
then just magic yourself

404
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,248

- Josh, I know
you're a smart guy.

408
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,256
And you want to believe
that this is real

409
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,725
because it feels so good,
but this isn't life, okay?

410
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,327
And I'm worried
the longer you stay here,

411
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,628
the less you'll want to leave.

412
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,864
- Look, he wants to stay.
Fine.

413
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:29,236

so we can get out.

not.

422

that's better.

423
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,697

I will not be helping you
escape.

Fillory has ever had.

- All of you.
Children of Earth.

The divine prank
of Ember and Umber's.

And you know what's
truly infuriating?

How you always really believe
you have the right.

434
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,354

the rules here.

435

to be followed.

No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

438
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,764

- Your Kingdom?

440

we did or didn't do,

that we have been through,
you couldn't just,

447
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,518

maybe talk to us?

we are going to
the Infinite Waterfall.

As soon as we reach
the point of no return,

454
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,636
we'll put them in a lifeboat
and let the rapids

455
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,671
carry them over the edge.

456
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,040

just undo these.

I couldn't find Kady,

You know, my brother got us
tickets to that concert.

491

Turned out to be the last one
Bowie did in the U.S.

- I saw it.
- It was amazing, wasn't it?

Ann Posner.

And even after they got back
and told me how great it was,

into the middle of the crowd

as I should've

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,979
* My darling I'm yours,
I'll throw away *

539
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,949
* My silk net, yes

540
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,818
[tense music]

541
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,120
- Look, have you seen anybody
else you know other than Todd?

542
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,656
Have you been outside?
- I mean, these guys are great.

543
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,792
And I'll get a campus tour
as soon as--

544
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,060
- Josh, this is not Brakebills.

545
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:32,699
- And this Todd,
very un-Todd.

546
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:36,002
The real Todd isn't creepily
bossy with a prancing army

547
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,805
that turns psycho the m--

548
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:39,872
Oh, no.

549
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:45,978
*

550
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:49,281
- Okay, Josh, the quest
brought us here for a reason,

551
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,652
and it's not to party to death
for Todd's pleasure.

552
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,353
Uh--
- Wait, that's it.

553
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,123
- What's it?
- Why Todd isn't Todd.

554
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,257
I think--
[pounding on door]

555
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,692
- Shit.

556
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,095
- Okay, look, we have been
total dicks to you,

557
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,097
and I swear to you,
we are gonna make it up to you,

558
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,365
but you have
to buy us some time

559
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,867
so that we can
figure this out.

560
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,669
- Figure it out or don't,
but if you're right,

561
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,237
and this is
my own private Idaho,

562
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:16,208
.

563
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:16,676
[tense music]

564
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,012

566

*

567
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,818
- Let's hustle.

568
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,888
[all cheering]

569
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:36,062
*

570
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,601
- Ready?

571
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,807
- [sighs]
- Okay.

572
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,976
It's okay.

573
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,210
Again.

574
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:57,149
One, two, three.

575
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,656
- [sighs]

576
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,159
This is silly.

577
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,729
- Maybe you're
teaching it wrong.

578
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:14,934
I've never seen a fairy do all
that Magician-y finger bending.

579
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,035
They are magic.

580
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,704
They don't have to access it.

581
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:22,809
They just get right to
the ruining-your-life part.

582
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,211
- Okay.

583
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,080
Here.
Give me your hand.

584
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:36,723
Imagine a flower growing out
of the palm of your hand.

585
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,991
But don't picture it
in your head.

586
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,193
Picture it here.

587
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:45,231
In the real world.

588
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:52,138
- * You might not ever
get rich *

589
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,007
* But let me tell you, it's
better than digging a ditch *

590
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,744
- Wait, Todd's a what?
- A traumesser.

591
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,011
It's from German folk tales.

592
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,013
It's a demon who creates
a pocket world

593
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,015
where all your fantasies
come true,

594
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,751
and then feeds off
your happiness.

595
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,853
- So, it's a joy junkie?

596
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:10,089
- Yeah, and it created all this
to mainline Josh.

597
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,291
- Who just happens
to look like Todd?

598
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,960
- It's also a shape-shifter.

599
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,462
- But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

600
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,165
And, why would it hide it?
- I don't know.

601
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,167
It's not malevolent.
Well, for demons.

602
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,403
- Okay, so the demon
had the Fifth Key here.

603
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,105
The book brought us here,
so the--

604
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:30,009
the key is still
gotta be here, right?

605
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,079
- Ugh, boy,
not working in E.

606
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,982
- What?
- Uh, just the--the song.

607
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:40,186
Not Todd has a fetish for--
- E.

608
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,288
- The Fifth Key.
- But from A.

609
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,495
[piano note reverberates
and rattles]

610
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,137
Wait, wait.
No fingers.

611
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,106
*

612
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,309
Sometimes bad shit happens.

[key clinks against glass]

614
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,313
Give it a sec.

615
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,381
See if it tells us what it is.

616
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,196
- Honey, you don't
have to listen to Tick.

617
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,798
You can just do your own thing.

618
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:30,236
Turn around, head home,
relax, whatevs.

619
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,975
[chains rattle]

620
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,177
Nothing.

621
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,247
- Maybe Tick was
right about us.

622
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,283
I mean, what really gave us
the right?

623
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:47,854
- Hey,
we didn't make the world.

624
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,857
It was baked by fucking
goat-meat nut-jobs,

625
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,424
so of course it's insane.

626
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,594
And of course we're insane for
thinking we can make it better.

627
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,463
But you know what?
- What?

628
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,331
- We did.

629
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:02,201
For a hot minute, we did.
- When?

630
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,137
- Right after you
and Idri sealed that deal.

631
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,472
- And he turned into a rat?

632
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,175
- I said "one hot minute."
- [chuckles]

633
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,277
- I meant, literally one
perfect minute

634
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,546
on this god-fucked rock.
- [laughs]

635
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,983
- And we can do it again.
We made it better.

636
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,250
I mean, come on.

637
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,852
We've pretty much
only ever had each other.

638
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:20,953
- Ugh.

639
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,589
- And that's gotten us through
pretty much everything.

640
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,624
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, everything.

641
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,126
- Everything.

642
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,396
[laughs]
Well, whatever happens,

643
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,300
thank you for giving us
the time where we can finally

644
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:40,239
just speak with no bullshit,
and I can just say,

645
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,275
I love you, Margo.

646
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,044
- I know.

- We've reached
the point of no return.

650
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:58,958
Please stop so
we can cast them off.

651

Please.
Stop.

Please?

I order you to stop,
this moment.

Scuttle all ships
that can think.

665

Write that down.

666
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,541
- I don't suppose
you'd stop for me?

667
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,413
[whimpers]
- Ah.

It kills them
when they use magic.

681
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,275
How could I not--
- Your eyes.

682

Julia.

683
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,445
The magic you just did.

684
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,313
You didn't use your hands.

685
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,582
How?

I don't know
where the coffee is.

698

I don't even know
if there is coffee here.

699
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,315
- Penny.

700
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,184
- Wait, you hear him too?
- Inside your head?

701
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,586
Yeah, me too.
- Penny, Penny!

where are you?

the Underworld Library.

Where are you?
How am I hearing you?

but we can all hear you.

can you hear all of us?

- Quentin?

Penny?
What's going on?

712
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,841
- Uh, okay, it's the Fifth Key;
that must be what it does.

713
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,843
It--it links us all up.

714

- Guys, I'm sure
this is important,

715
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,184
but I almost killed somebody.

716
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,820
And then somehow
froze her in time.

717
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,256
And I'm not sure
what to do next.

718
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,759
So just give me a sec.
Hi.

719
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,829
- Well, we're chained to a boat
about to go over a waterfall.

720
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,765
- Yeah, complete
with lacerating rocks, so...

721
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,467
- Oh, shit,
the Infinite Waterfall.

722
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,237
- Not helping--
wait, you guys have magic.

723
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,638
Can you stop this boat?

724
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,173
- No, it's not that
kind of magic.

725
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,875
- Great, well, enjoy
our death screams, I guess.

726
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,677
- Hey, everybody
out of my head.

727
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,647
- Josh--oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I think, um--

728
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,349
- Look, look, we go
back to Brakebills.

729
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,117
And then we get the Time Key,
and we reverse--

730
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,552
- No, no, no, we can't go
through the door.

731
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,187
- Why?

732
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,655
- Because we are all
listening to each other.

733
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,690
We're speaking to each other.
All eight of us.

734
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,392
That--

735
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,761
That's what it is, it's unity.
Uh...

736
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,231
The Quest brought us to a world
made for the Quester

737
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,499
who always feels left behind.

738
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,267
The key--

739
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,901
The key needs us
to work together.

740
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,570
Um--
- Oh, bullshit!

741
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,373
[music stops]

742
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:09,608
You know, everything was great
until you guys got here,

743
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,610
so just go.
- Wait, who's that?

744
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,279
- Perfect, thank you, Penny.

745
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,513
[tense music]

746
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,182
You know what?
Fuck the rule.

747
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,650
- No, Josh, uh,
Josh, just calm down, I--

748
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,187
- And fuck you!

749

*

750
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,356
Wah!

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,492

753
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:30,262
Ah, no, no.

754
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,830
- Okay, everybody, listen.

755
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,400
Um, we have to save Josh

756
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:35,834
and convince him
to come back with us.

757
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,703
- No idea what
you're talking about.

758
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,838
- All right, well, we've got
some life and death stakes

759
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,507
of our own over here.

760
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,676
- Yes, we're all fucked
in our own way, like always.

761
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,178
But if we do not do this,

762
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,614
then the Quest is done.

763
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,883
Okay, we have to work together
and we have to do it now.

764
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,186
All right,
it's gonna sound weird,

765
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,187
but just go with me.

766
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,622
You're gonna hear music,

767
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,624
and I'm gonna make sure that
everyone knows the words,

768
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,261
but every single one of us
has to sing.

"Under Pressure" plays]

00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:08,634
- Ah, stop!
Ugh, no.

00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,537

- Who said--what?

847
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,703
- The only one I'd do this for.

848
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,473
To be honest,
it was kind of a pain.

849
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:10,542
Nothing personal, Josh,
but after a couple of weeks,

850
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,044
I started having doubts whether
your friends would come

851
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,180
or actually be worthy.

852
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,549
- Right, so this was
all a test?

853
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,487
- Everything's just a test.
Right, Pen?

854
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,756
Penny?

855
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,459
Penny, can you hear me?
- Eliot, Margo?

Wait, why can't we hear
each other anymore?

858

but pigging out on
Josh's dream world

859
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,735
has left me
a little gassy.

860
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,805
I need a little me time
at the ashram.

- Yep.
