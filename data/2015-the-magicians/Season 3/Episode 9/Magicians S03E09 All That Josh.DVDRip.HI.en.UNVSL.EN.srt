180
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,936
Why do you think we went in
with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

181
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,038
If we'd known it
was a wombat judge,

182
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,674
we would've hired
a wombat lawyer.

183
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,117
There is some good news.

184
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,654
You are free...

185
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,589
To choose the manner
of your execution.

186
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,118
Tick.

187
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,255
I don't mean to sound snappish,

188
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,698
but what part of that
news is remotely good?

189
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,795
It's an honor only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

The steep climb up
Fire Ant Mountain.

194
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,138
I'd pick the
serrated spoon first.

195
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,912
The Infinite Waterfall.
The Stone Crush.

196
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,280
Wait.

197
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,718
"Infinite Waterfall"?

198
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,086
It's quite horrid, and
wet. (CHUCKLES)

199
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,921
Right.

200
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,826
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

201
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,057
The one with the
word "infinite" in it.

202
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,994
Right? Right.

00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,797

sins and repent.

waters against walls of razor rocks,

209
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,878
so you bleed out or drown,

210
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,219
or if you're lucky,
just starve to death.

and grind it into powder

They don't have to access it.

534
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,704

the ruining-your-life part.

Okay.

00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,242
Here. Give me your hand.

out of the palm of your hand.

it in your head.

544
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,105
It's from German folktales.

545
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,114
It's a demon who creates a pocket
world where all your fantasies come true,

546
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,774
and then feeds
off your happiness.

547
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,909
So, it's a joy junkie?

548
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,216
Yeah, and it created
all this to mainline Josh.

to look like Todd?

It's also a shape-shifter.

551
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,651
But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

552
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,218
And, why would it hide it?

Well, for demons.

had the Fifth Key here.

We did.

I started having doubts
whether your friends would come

pigging out on Josh's dream world
