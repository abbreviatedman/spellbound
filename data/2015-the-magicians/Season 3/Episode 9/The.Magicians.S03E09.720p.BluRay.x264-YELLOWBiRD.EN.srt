1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,833
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,504
Children of Earth have been making
a mess of things here for some time.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,837
I'm your Queen!

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:14,763
I demand that this trial/peasant
uprising be dismissed.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,261
Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,095
Come with me
if you want to live.

7
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,603
It has begun.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,689
Sorry.

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,140
Is that cocaine?

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,477
It's the excretion of a very rare
magical creature.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,981
But, yes, you will
have to snort it.

12
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,072
What creature?

13
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,317
<i>A fairy?</i>

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,571
And I can't see her because
I've never made a fairy deal?

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,527
My daughter's dead
because of them.

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,534
You need to talk
to Irene's fairy.

17
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,865
My name is Skye.

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,700
Fen, what is it?
What do you see?

19
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,875
It's her, it's Skye.

20
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,453
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

21
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,709
<i>That's what the powder
is made of.</i>

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,804
Weren't you supposed to
report to the Underworld

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,596
<i>branch of the Library anyway?</i>

24
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,474
Yeah, and I burned my body
to avoid that.

25
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,722
Did you...

26
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,974
Okay, come on.

27
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,521
Alice, are you working
with the Library?

28
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,017
Maybe we should've waited at the mirror
for a little while longer.

29
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,408
- I mean, maybe they survived somehow.
- They didn't.

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,085
Ask her.

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,299
Harriet and Victoria
were in the bridge.

32
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,585
I'm pretty sure
both mirrors shattered.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,671
Oh, my God. No.

34
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,177
There's your answer.

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,101
Where's your bag?

36
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,020
I need the Truth Key.

37
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,897
To see Penny,
if he made it back.

38
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,144
All right.

39
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,898
You found the Fourth Key?

40
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,954
Here we go.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,837
Okay. It's in code.

42
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,471
Mmm.

43
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,768
Be careful with that.

44
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,557
Penny?

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,181
- This looks familiar.
- You know what? No.

46
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,397
Not till you tell me what you were
doing in the Library.

47
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,481
I was finishing something.

48
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,609
Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

49
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,149
I needed information.

50
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,528
Penny!

51
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,077
Funny, 'cause there is
no magic to unify.

52
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,071
Just let me see it again.

53
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,541
No.

54
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,325
I... I know what it is.

55
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,127
Music.

56
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,548
Music?

57
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,666
Medieval music.

58
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,926
Here.

59
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,851
Just give it a minute, okay?

60
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,277
- Sure you're playing it right?
- Yes, I'm sure.

61
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,653
Then you're an idiot.

62
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,577
Back then the scale
didn't start at C.

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,116
So that's an A.

64
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,616
What?

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,292
No, I just didn't know
that you had...

66
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,335
Well, me and music go way back.

67
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,422
It's what my mom took her
clothes off to for money.

68
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,882
And save the judgment.
She was good.

69
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:43,179
And she liked it.
And it paid for piano lessons.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,941
What? Where'd it go?

71
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,783
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

72
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,906
What the hell?

73
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,586
Where did
all these people come from?

74
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,958
Who are they?

75
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,498
I don't recognize them.

76
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,958
What time is it, y'all?

77
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,087
Todd.

78
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:27,220
Yeah, it's time for the one,
the only King of Party O'Clock!

79
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,059
<i>Can't wait for the time
When I could shed my skin.</i>

80
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,271
<i>You can't read my mind
But if you're wondering</i>

81
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,607
<i>I'm somebody else,
you ain't met me before</i>

82
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,738
<i>I'll put my real face on.</i>

83
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,444
<i>Open the door.</i>

84
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,539
<i>Wham, bam, here I am.</i>

85
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,538
<i>Demon of the glitter and glam.</i>

86
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,960
<i>Yes, catch your breath.</i>

87
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,753
<i>Got you eating out of my hand.</i>

88
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,171
<i>Wham, thank you, ma'am.</i>

89
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,044
<i>Now I'm here, the party is on.</i>

90
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,841
<i>Wow, check me out.</i>

91
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,420
<i>Don't know what you got
till it's gone.</i>

92
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,380
Guys, what took you so long?

93
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,682
<i>Pump the beat through my veins.</i>

94
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,636
<i>Ain't no stopping me now.</i>

95
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,345
<i>Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.</i>

96
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,101
<i>Now I'm here, the party is on.</i>

97
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,682
<i>Wow, check us out.</i>

98
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,253
<i>Don't know what you got
till it's gone.</i>

99
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,984
<i>Need it up, need it up.</i>

100
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,563
<i>Turn the freakin' music up Gone.</i>

101
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,987
I think we've found Hell.

102
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,716
Whatever this is,
I don't have time.

103
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,097
Where's the door?

104
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Really?

105
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,987
All the clocks say 4:20.

106
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,822
Well, it's not hell for Josh.

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,060
Why would the book send us here?

108
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,916
- Where are we?
- Guys.

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,706
Great to see you.

110
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,879
Seriously, it's been too long.

111
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,504
Little word of advice,
this is a no-rules zone, except one.

112
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,551
You gotta be the vibe.

113
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,970
And the vibe is fun-in-the-sun,

114
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,888
and you can't throw shade,
<i>capisce?</i>

115
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,591
I have no idea
what you just said.

116
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,807
Good to see you, uh...

117
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,892
Where are we, exactly?

118
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,274
And why are they doing that?

119
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,900
Okay, guys.

120
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,573
Guys, it's okay.
It's okay, all right?

121
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,944
What Joshster was telling you,

122
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,030
it's all good
in the New World Order,

123
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,906
but one rule, okay?

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,037
Have a blast, or <i>adiós.</i>

125
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,165
How do we <i>"adiós, "</i> Todd?
There's no door.

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,419
True, but the trade-off...

127
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,624
Is this.

128
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,089
Holy shit.

129
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,469
Yeah, we're not just partying
'cause it's fun.

130
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,765
Uh-uh.

131
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,600
We're tearing it up 'cause
magic is back, my babies.

132
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,104
Yeah, it is.

133
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,233
Whoo-hoo.

134
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,075
How? I...

135
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,326
Two words. "Who cares?"

136
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,219
Oh, my gosh, this feels...

137
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,963
That bone saw.

138
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,921
The smith who forged it
must've been a monster.

139
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,678
Fen, I did a whole line
of that fairy coke shit.

140
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,099
All right? We've gotta help.

141
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,721
- We can't.
- Excuse me?

142
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,304
I agree that what's being
done to the fairies is awful,

143
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,142
but they are evil, and I told you
what they did to me, my daughter.

144
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,810
And Julia,
they can't be enslaved.

145
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,020
They can do magic.

146
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,026
Yeah, but that was in Fillory.

147
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,982
You know, it's obviously
different here.

148
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,443
Maybe...
Maybe they're different.

149
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,991
And I can see them
without making a deal.

150
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,747
How?

151
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,765
What the fuck-me hell?

152
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,387
You've been found guilty.

153
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,515
By a marsupial in a wig
and a robe.

154
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,972
The judge
you requested for trial.

155
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,023
- The Wombat?
- "Wombat"?

156
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,941
Jesus, Tick, I said "combat."

157
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,815
We wanted trial by combat.

158
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,773
That is not, as you would say,
"a thing" in Fillory.

159
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,906
Why do you think we went
in with Bingle, a mute swordsman?

160
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,032
If we'd known
it was a wombat judge,

161
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,660
we would've hired
a wombat lawyer.

162
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,083
There is some good news.

163
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,660
You are free...

164
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,581
To choose the manner
of your execution.

165
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,084
Tick.

166
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,261
I don't mean to sound snappish,

167
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,681
but what part of that news
is remotely good?

168
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,761
It's an honor only bestowed upon
the greatest of deposed monarchs.

169
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,061
Let's see.

170
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,139
The serrated spoon...

171
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,475
Don't pick that one.

172
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,525
The steep climb
up Fire Ant Mountain.

173
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,104
I'd pick
the serrated spoon first.

174
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,906
The Infinite Waterfall.
The Stone Crush.

175
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,275
Wait.

176
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,701
"Infinite Waterfall"?

177
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,074
It's quite horrid, and wet.

178
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,909
Right.

179
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,834
But which death on your
little list takes the longest?

180
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,046
The one with the word
"infinite" in it.

181
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,960
- Right?
- Right.

182
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,791
A lot of time to...

183
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,678
Think on our royal sins
and repent.

184
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,802
Plan on how best to...

185
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,851
Meet death... Gracefully.

186
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,391
As desired then.

187
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,690
You will plummet through freezing waters
against walls of razor rocks,

188
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,859
so you bleed out or drown,

189
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,188
or if you're lucky,
just starve to death.

190
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,195
I really don't think we could've
picked a better option.

191
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,663
Feels really good.

192
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,418
There's something
very wrong here.

193
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,090
None of my locator spells
are working.

194
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,418
I... I don't know where we are.

195
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,252
How about I just blow
a hole in the wall?

196
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,338
Sure, go ahead, but...

197
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,846
The only magic
that works here is...

198
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,268
- Party tricks.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,845
Look, we're on the quest.

200
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,228
So maybe there's a clue
in what we can and can't do.

201
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,186
What we can't do is sit
around here getting blitzed

202
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,271
on never-ending scotch.

203
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,356
It's cognac, actually.

204
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,113
- Easy.
- You, easy.

205
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,195
- For all I know, this is you.
- Me?

206
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,452
Yeah, doing shit for your Library
buddies to slow us down.

207
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,541
Okay, hey, you know what?

208
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,209
We're all pretty raw,
so why don't we have a drink?

209
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,299
Wait a minute.

210
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,172
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

211
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,300
- Uh...
- No, no, no, no, no.

212
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,554
No, no, no, no. I'm not...

213
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,767
<i>Ha... Ha...
Happy birthday to you.</i>

214
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,692
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

215
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:25,743
<i>Happy birthday, dear...</i>

216
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:30,744
<i>Fun and amazing party hounds.</i>

217
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:36,079
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

218
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,754
<i>You.</i>

219
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,047
There's Josh.

220
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,503
We have to figure this out now.

221
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,758
We can't do it here.

222
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,259
We gotta get him alone.

223
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,682
I can get him upstairs.

224
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,805
Somebody has to stay here
and put on a show

225
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,636
so that they don't pick up
on any bad vibes.

226
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,730
Okay. You take the nerd.

227
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,230
I got these bozos.

228
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,537
I can thank good ol' Mom.

229
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,439
Ah.

230
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,360
Here. Here, I...

231
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,408
Who are you?

232
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,030
How can you see me?

233
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,657
I'm Julia.

234
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,161
You've probably
seen me with Irene?

235
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,661
You're Skye.

236
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,119
My... My friend Fen,
she told me about you,

237
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,578
about what happened to your leg.

238
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,289
I'm sorry, I'm very busy.

239
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,294
You clean their homes,
you cook their food,

240
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,424
and they take your leg
and grind it into powder

241
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,597
to snort so they can
do magic tricks.

242
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,808
I wanna help you
get out of here.

243
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,765
No.

244
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,641
No, this is the way.

245
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,848
We can't do magic.

246
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,308
We're helpless.

247
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,938
The McAllistairs,
they protect us.

248
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,613
No, the McAllistairs use you.
And they hurt you.

249
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,658
Mrs. McAllistair
will be angry if I'm late.

250
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,199
I'm told that fairies
can do magic.

251
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,996
If that's true,
if I can show you that,

252
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,875
it proves that the McAllistairs
have lied to you.

253
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,000
About everything.

254
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,468
Meet me in the lab as soon
as you can get away.

255
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,263
Deal?

256
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:14,362
<i>Got my new gown.</i>

257
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,741
<i>Got my hair...</i>

258
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,832
Wait.

259
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,540
Wrong key. Try E.

260
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,578
It's in A.

261
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,585
We like it in E.

262
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,176
That's... An excellent idea.

263
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,385
Thank you.

264
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,932
I always felt a connection.

265
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,680
Especially when you'd
glare at me

266
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,762
like you were trying to kill me.

267
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,931
I always thought
you were annoying.

268
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,937
Which turns out
to be my power move.

269
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,563
Yeah, just not today.

270
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,948
<i>Got my new gown.</i>

271
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,285
<i>Got my hair down.</i>

272
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,544
<i>All I need, oh.</i>

273
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,048
<i>Is the boy.</i>

274
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,381
<i>Got my silk net.</i>

275
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,927
<i>Got my heart set.</i>

276
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:25,141
<i>Got my five yards
Of beaded crêpe de chine on.</i>

277
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:30,150
<i>Now all I need's
a strong arm to lean on.</i>

278
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:35,451
<i>If he'll just appear.</i>

279
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:41,116
<i>We'll use this big town.</i>

280
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,954
<i>For a toy.</i>

281
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,460
<i>And if.</i>

282
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,586
<i>He'll say.</i>

283
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,793
<i>My darling, I'm yours</i>

284
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,004
<i>I'll throw away.</i>

285
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,589
<i>My silk nets.</i>

286
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:02,303
<i>Yes, and every bead.</i>

287
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,356
<i>All I really need.</i>

288
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,061
<i>Is the boy.</i>

289
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,154
Ugh!

290
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,408
Ugh.

291
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,990
Is this a thing
you guys are into?

292
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,084
I'm not judging,

293
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,408
it's just a little high school.

294
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,952
Oh, my God.

295
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,171
Is that the book?

296
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,086
Not here.

297
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,509
All right, of course.
It's not even our piano.

298
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,052
It's just a part of all this.

299
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,783
I don't know what you guys
are babbling about.

300
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,451
I had it moved up here
so I could rehearse.

301
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,744
Hence the reason
it's in my room.

302
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,975
This isn't your room.

303
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,893
Yeah, Josh, you're a Naturalist.

304
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,721
This is not even your house.

305
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,627
That's pretty much all
you know about me, right?

306
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,732
Where am I from?

307
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,310
Where'd I go to undergrad?

308
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,691
When is the last time
we actually saw each other?

309
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,898
A couple of weeks ago? I...

310
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,904
Exactly. I texted, I called.

311
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,907
Over and over, to try to get back
with you guys and go on the quest.

312
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,579
Go ahead, check your phones.

313
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,749
I got one reply, from Julia.

314
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,371
Then <i>nada</i> from any of you.

315
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,703
And that's pretty much all
you think about me, right?

316
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,466
<i>Got my new gown.</i>

317
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:22,345
<i>Got my hair down.</i>

318
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,600
<i>All I need now.</i>

319
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:31,275
<i>Is the boy.</i>

320
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,320
<i>Got my silk net...</i>

321
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,693
Ventriloquist act. Nice trick.

322
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,143
Is that even
your voice down there?

323
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,822
Brava.

324
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,620
You really contacted a lot.

325
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,573
Sorry, we were just so...

326
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,283
Narcissistically up
your own asses?

327
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,295
Look, you ditched us
in Fillory, so it's not...

328
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,667
Not the same.
That was cowardice.

329
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,420
Not indifference.

330
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,966
Look, it's fine. It's fine.

331
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,670
Because we don't really know each other,
and now we don't need to.

332
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,847
Quest is over. Magic is back.

333
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,048
Okay, great, well,

334
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,862
then just magic yourself
out of those ropes.

335
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,347
That is weird.

336
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,729
Josh, I know you're a smart guy.

337
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,296
And you want to believe that
this is real

338
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,812
because it feels so good,
but this isn't life, okay?

339
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,746
And I'm worried the longer you stay here,
the less you'll want to leave.

340
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,993
Look, he wants to stay. Fine.

341
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,492
Just tell us how you got here
so we can get out.

342
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,634
Leave us.

343
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,514
All right.

344
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,808
Good, good, good, good, good,
good, good.

345
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,303
You pickpocketed the key?

346
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,478
I did...

347
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,690
Not.

348
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,838
Wait till it gets dark,
that's better.

349
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,767
Let me stop you right there.

350
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,318
I will not be
helping you escape.

351
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,148
In fact, I will not be
helping you with anything,

352
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,777
- ever again.
- Wait, what?

353
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,324
You're the worst.

354
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,575
The absolute worst rulers
Fillory has ever had.

355
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,280
Oh, come on. Martin Chatwin?

356
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,616
All of you. Children of Earth.

357
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,622
The divine prank
of Ember and Umber's.

358
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,453
And you know
what's truly infuriating?

359
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,711
How you always really believe
you have the right.

360
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,340
Look, we didn't make
the rules here.

361
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,838
We don't even like them.

362
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,092
Good, as they no longer
need to be followed.

363
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,800
No magic means
no more idiotic Earth rulers,

364
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,850
and I get my Kingdom back.

365
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,018
Your Kingdom?

366
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,438
I ran Fillory for years.

367
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,145
Tick.

368
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,728
Maybe we can just
take a beat, okay?

369
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,690
If there's something that
we did or didn't do,

370
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,777
or missed or fucked up,
don't you think after everything

371
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,056
that we have been through,
you couldn't just,

372
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,537
I don't know, maybe talk to us?

373
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,162
I refuse to beg for what
I have waited to seize.

374
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,752
Now is the time.

375
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:03,427
<i>Muntjac,</i> we are going
to the Infinite Waterfall.

376
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,344
As soon as we reach
the Point of No Return,

377
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,673
we'll put them in a lifeboat
and let the rapids

378
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,724
carry them over the edge.

379
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,223
And then finally
have a free Fillory

380
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,977
of, for,
and by Fillorians like us.

381
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,396
What do you say?

382
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,647
Allies?

383
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,568
Her too?

384
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,031
Does everybody hate us?

385
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,238
All right, you've got us
guarded and locked down here.

386
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,785
You might as well
just undo these.

387
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,037
I shall...

388
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,545
Not!

389
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,543
Okay, the "not" thing
is kind of arch.

390
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,651
How is this not a terrible idea?

391
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,402
Fen, whatever they did,
they don't deserve to...

392
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,233
I mean, nobody deserves to...

393
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,747
Mrs. McAllistair is dining.

394
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,325
I have one hour.

395
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,663
Uh...

396
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,460
Okay, um,
we won't push too hard.

397
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,508
I just want to see
what you can do.

398
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:32,717
So after I couldn't find Kady,
I called and called and called...

399
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,644
Okay, we suck. Got it.

400
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,228
Next?

401
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,398
I went back to Bacchus'.
Party was still raging.

402
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,726
<i>But no matter how hard
I hit the pharmaceuticals,</i>

403
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,733
<i>I couldn't shake the fact that I was
ditched hard by you guys.</i>

404
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,527
Which wasn't exactly unfamiliar.

405
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,108
And, can you untie me?

406
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,865
You've made your point
and I can't feel my thumbs.

407
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,287
It's a life theme for me,
I guess.

408
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,462
You know, my brother got us
tickets to that concert.

409
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,461
Turned out to be the last one
Bowie did in the U.S.

410
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,551
I saw it.

411
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,048
It was amazing, wasn't it?

412
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,674
It's what I heard
from my brother,

413
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,596
who ditched me
to take Ann Posner.

414
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,300
And even after they got back
and told me how great it was,

415
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,247
and that Bowie went
into the middle of the crowd

416
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,389
to do <i>Under Pressure,</i>
I didn't feel as bad as I should've

417
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,362
because I was just like,
"This is what happens."

418
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,108
"This is what's always
gonna happen."

419
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,274
Can we just get back to
the part of how you got here?

420
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,157
- Todd?
- What's up, brother?

421
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,834
Not my dick. I gotta crash.

422
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:42,921
Hey, uh...

423
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,088
Let you in on a little secret?

424
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,087
Get the fuck out.

425
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,350
Okay... One, if I'm tripping,
keep me on a molly drip.

426
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,268
Two, who else knows?

427
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,688
Three, how?

428
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,525
One, you are not tripping.

429
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,824
Two, everyone who needs to know.

430
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,151
And three...

431
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,203
<i>Wait, Todd has the Fifth Key?</i>

432
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,077
It's one of them. I'm not sure.

433
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,874
Well, let's get it.

434
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:22,997
Well...

435
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,121
The Key...

436
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,507
Isn't the key to what
we're getting up to here.

437
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,380
Okay, but that's
pretty important.

438
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,757
I need to tell my friends.
Are they here?

439
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:38,137
And sorry, but how can magic be back
if you have one of the keys?

440
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,145
And why are they...

441
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,517
Yes, we lived it.

442
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,600
- Uh, have a blast or... <i>Adiós.</i>
<i>- Adiós.</i>

443
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,856
That wasn't maybe a clue
all this was fake?

444
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,359
It's not fake.
It's just different, okay?

445
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,064
Magic comes back,
it's a little off.

446
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,400
Things always evolve.

447
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,827
<i>For a toy.</i>

448
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,079
<i>And if he'll say.</i>

449
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,667
<i>My darling I'm yours,
I'll throw away.</i>

450
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,629
<i>My silk net, yes.</i>

451
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,845
Look, have you seen anybody else
you know other than Todd?

452
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,051
Have you been outside?

453
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,305
I mean, these guys are great.

454
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,437
And I'll get a campus tour
as soon as...

455
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,765
Josh, this is not Brakebills.

456
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,320
And this Todd, very un-Todd.

457
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,694
The real Todd isn't creepily
bossy with a prancing army

458
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,864
that turns psycho the...

459
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,027
Oh, no.

460
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:48,041
Okay, Josh, the quest
brought us here for a reason,

461
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,248
and it's not to party to death
for Todd's pleasure.

462
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,377
Wait, that's it.

463
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,213
What's it?

464
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,839
Why Todd isn't Todd.

465
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,010
I think...

466
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,338
Shit.

467
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay, look,
we have been total dicks to you,

468
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,872
and I swear to you, we are gonna
make it up to you,

469
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,307
but you have to buy us some time

470
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,583
so that we can figure this out.

471
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,327
Figure it out or don't,
but if you're right,

472
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,522
and this is my own private Idaho,
I want you out of it.

473
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,872
Let's hustle.

474
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,755
Ready?

475
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,146
It's okay.

476
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,223
Again.

477
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,853
One, two, three.

478
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,571
This is silly.

479
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,082
Maybe you're teaching it wrong.

480
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:14,002
I've never seen a fairy do all
that Magician-y finger bending.

481
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,127
They are magic.

482
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,708
They don't have to access it.

483
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,715
They just get right to
the ruining-your-life part.

484
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,932
Okay.

485
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,222
Here. Give me your hand.

486
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,684
Imagine a flower growing out
of the palm of your hand.

487
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,733
But don't picture it
in your head.

488
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,648
Picture it here.

489
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,900
In the real world.

490
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,417
<i>You might not ever get rich.</i>

491
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,079
<i>But let me tell you
It's better than digging a ditch.</i>

492
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,756
- Wait, Todd's a what?
- A traumesser.

493
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,083
It's from German folktales.

494
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,091
It's a demon who creates a pocket world
where all your fantasies come true,

495
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,763
and then
feeds off your happiness.

496
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,886
So, it's a joy junkie?

497
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,185
Yeah, and it created all this
to mainline Josh.

498
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,433
Who just happens
to look like Todd?

499
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,014
It's also a shape-shifter.

500
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,646
But how would it find
the Fifth Key and why?

501
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,193
And, why would it hide it?

502
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,279
I don't know.

503
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,275
It's not malevolent.
Well, for demons.

504
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,574
Okay, so the demon
had the Fifth Key here.

505
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,496
The book brought us here, so the...
The key has still gotta be here, right?

506
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:32,166
Ugh, boy, not working in E.

507
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,289
- What?
- No, just the... The song.

508
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,295
- Not Todd has a fetish for...
- E.

509
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,384
The Fifth Key.

510
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,469
But from A.

511
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,273
Wait, wait. No fingers.

512
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,692
Sometimes bad shit happens.

513
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,442
Give it a sec.

514
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,198
See if it tells us what it is.

515
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,297
Honey, you don't have
to listen to Tick.

516
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,798
You can just do your own thing.

517
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,097
Turn around, head home,
relax, whatevs.

518
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,268
Nothing.

519
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,442
Maybe Tick was right about us.

520
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,404
I mean, what really
gave us the right?

521
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,858
Hey, we didn't make the world.

522
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,865
It was baked by fucking
goat-meat nutjobs,

523
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,571
so of course it's insane.

524
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,783
And of course we're insane for
thinking we can make it better.

525
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,333
- But you know what?
- What?

526
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,752
We did.

527
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,209
For a hot minute, we did.

528
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,299
When?

529
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,217
Right after you and Idri
sealed that deal.

530
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,635
And he turned into a rat?

531
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,259
I said "one hot minute."

532
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,092
I meant, literally one perfect minute
on this god-fucked rock.

533
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,020
And we can do it again.
We made it better.

534
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,347
I mean, come on.

535
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,979
We've pretty much
only ever had each other.

536
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,777
And that's gotten us through
pretty much everything.

537
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,820
- Mmm-hmm.
- I mean, everything.

538
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,192
Everything.

539
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,526
Well, whatever happens,

540
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,408
thank you for giving us
the time where we can finally

541
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,959
just speak with no bullshit,
and I can just say...

542
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,333
I love you, Margo.

543
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,466
I know.

544
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,349
We've reached the point
of no return.

545
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,143
Please stop so we can
cast them off.

546
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,432
Please. Stop.

547
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,732
Please?

548
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,445
I order you to stop,
this moment.

549
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,488
I am your king.

550
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,237
Stop right now.

551
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,979
My first Royal Proclamation.

552
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,058
Scuttle all ships
that can think.

553
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,483
Write that down!

554
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,730
I don't suppose
you'd stop for me?

555
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,494
Ah.

556
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,413
Fuck this.

557
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,345
Holy shit.

558
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,040
The necklace.

559
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,881
It kills them
when they use magic.

560
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,884
- How could I not...
- Your eyes.

561
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,974
Julia.

562
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,095
The magic you just did.

563
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,927
You didn't use your hands.

564
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,137
How?

565
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,397
I think I'm leveling up.

566
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,527
<i>Working at the car wash.</i>

567
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,575
<i>Working at the car wash Yeah.</i>

568
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,111
<i>Come on down and sing it with me.</i>

569
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,412
<i>Car wash.</i>

570
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,667
<i>Car wash, yeah.</i>

571
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,006
<i>Dude, I'm new here, okay?</i>

572
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,708
<i>I don't know
where the coffee is.</i>

573
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,919
<i>I don't even know
if there is coffee here.</i>

574
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,174
Penny.

575
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,825
- Wait, you hear him too?
- Inside your head?

576
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,262
- Yeah, me too.
- Penny, Penny!

577
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,934
Wait, Kady?

578
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,602
Oh, my God, Penny,
where are you?

579
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,180
I'm... I'm in
the Underworld Library.

580
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,436
Where are you?
How am I hearing you?

581
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,268
I don't know,
but we can all hear you.

582
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,604
Yeah, can you...
Can you hear all of us?

583
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,485
- Am I hallucinating? Um...
- If you are, so am I.

584
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,532
- Eliot, Margo?
<i>- Quentin?</i>

585
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,781
Penny? What's going on?

586
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,579
Uh... Okay, it's the Fifth Key.
That must be what it does.

587
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,578
It... It links us all up.

588
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:11,673
Guys, I'm sure this is important,
but I almost killed somebody.

589
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,549
<i>And then somehow
froze her in time.</i>

590
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,844
And I'm not sure
what to do next.

591
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,343
So just give me a sec.

592
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,468
Hi.

593
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,552
Well, we're chained to a boat
about to go over a waterfall.

594
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,479
Yeah, complete
with lacerating rocks, so...

595
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,101
Oh, shit,
the Infinite Waterfall.

596
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,808
Not helping...
Wait, you guys have magic.

597
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,313
<i>Can you stop this boat?</i>

598
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,736
No, it's not that kind of magic.

599
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,610
Great, well, enjoy our death screams,
I guess.

600
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,362
Hey, everybody out of my head.

601
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,319
Josh... Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I think...

602
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,949
Look, look,
we go back to Brakebills.

603
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,725
And then we get the Time Key,
and we reverse...

604
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,269
No, no, no, we can't
go through the door.

605
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,293
Why?

606
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,331
<i>Because we are all
listening to each other.</i>

607
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,378
<i>We're speaking to each other.
All eight of us.</i>

608
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,000
That...

609
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,582
That's what it is, it's unity.

610
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,799
Uh... The quest brought us to
a world made for the Quester

611
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,129
who always feels left behind.

612
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,636
The key... The key needs us
to work together.

613
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,262
Oh, bullshit!

614
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,271
You know, everything was great
until you guys got here,

615
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,269
- <i>so just go.</i>
- Wait, who's that?

616
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,850
Perfect, thank you, Penny.

617
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,728
You know what? Fuck the rule.

618
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,314
No, Josh, Josh,
just calm down, I...

619
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,408
And fuck you!

620
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,829
No, no. No!

621
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,535
Okay, everybody, listen.

622
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,544
We have to save Josh and convince
him to come back with us.

623
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,375
No idea
what you're talking about.

624
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,552
All right, well, we've got
some life-and-death stakes

625
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,129
of our own over here.

626
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,340
Yes, we're all fucked
in our own way, like always.

627
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,643
But if we do not do this,
then the quest is done.

628
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,598
Okay, we have to work together
and we have to do it now.

629
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,729
All right, it's gonna sound weird,
but just go with me.

630
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,276
<i>You're gonna hear music,</i>

631
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,341
and we're gonna make sure that
everyone knows the words,

632
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,574
but every single one of us
has to sing.

633
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,739
God, I hate you.

634
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,450
Stop! No.

635
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,370
No! No, stop, stop!

636
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,772
<i>Pressure pushing down on me.</i>

637
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,851
<i>Pressing down on you
No man ask for.</i>

638
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,561
<i>Under pressure.</i>

639
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,945
<i>That burns a building down
Splits a family in two.</i>

640
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,321
<i>Puts people on streets</i>

641
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,709
Julia?

642
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,832
<i>That's the terror of knowing.</i>

643
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,255
<i>What this world is about.</i>

644
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,628
<i>Watching some good friends.</i>

645
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,301
<i>Screaming, "Let me out!"</i>

646
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,802
<i>Pray tomorrow takes me higher.</i>

647
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,760
<i>Pressure on people
People on streets.</i>

648
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,856
<i>Okay.</i>

649
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,654
<i>Chippin' around.</i>

650
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,698
<i>Kick my brains around the floor.</i>

651
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,119
<i>These are the days
It never rains but it pours.</i>

652
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,587
<i>People on streets.</i>

653
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,625
<i>People on streets.</i>

654
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,468
<i>It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about.</i>

655
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,392
<i>Watching some good friends.</i>

656
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,686
<i>Screaming let me out.</i>

657
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,685
<i>Pray tomorrow takes me higher.</i>

658
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,357
<i>Higher high.</i>

659
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,402
<i>Pressure on people
People on streets.</i>

660
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,899
God damn it, Penny.

661
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,864
<i>Turned away from it all
like a blind man.</i>

662
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,823
<i>Sat on a fence but it don't work.</i>

663
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,373
<i>Keep coming up with love.</i>

664
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,951
<i>But it's so slashed and torn.</i>

665
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,661
<i>Why.</i>

666
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,882
<i>Why Why.</i>

667
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,507
<i>Love love love love love.</i>

668
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,845
<i>Insanity laughs
Under pressure we're cracking.</i>

669
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:39,103
<i>Can't we give ourselves
one more chance.</i>

670
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,527
<i>Why can't we give love
That one more chance.</i>

671
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,232
<i>Why can't we give love
Give love, give love.</i>

672
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,739
<i>Give love, give love, give love.</i>

673
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,365
<i>Give love, give love</i>

674
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:57,575
<i>'Cause love's
such an old-fashioned word.</i>

675
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,628
<i>And love dares you.</i>

676
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,796
<i>To care for.</i>

677
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:08,469
<i>The people on the edge
of the night.</i>

678
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,047
<i>And love dares you.</i>

679
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:18,104
<i>To change our way
Of caring about ourselves.</i>

680
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:26,189
<i>This is our last dance.</i>

681
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,698
<i>This is ourselves.</i>

682
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,446
<i>Under pressure.</i>

683
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,406
<i>Under pressure.</i>

684
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,243
<i>Pressure.</i>

685
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,258
Bowie fan?

686
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,142
Margo fan.

687
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,684
Well, he said you'd ace it.

688
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,147
Who said... What?

689
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,316
The only one I'd do this for.

690
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,019
To be honest,
it was kind of a pain.

691
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,106
Nothing personal, Josh,
but after a couple of weeks,

692
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,737
I started having doubts whether
your friends would come

693
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,659
or actually be worthy.

694
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,113
Right, so this was all a test?

695
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,324
Everything's just a test.
Right, Pen?

696
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,837
Penny?

697
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,580
Penny, can you hear me?

698
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,005
Eliot, Margo?

699
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,003
Wait, why can't we hear
each other anymore?

700
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,804
I don't mean to be rude, but pigging
out on Josh's dream world

701
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,348
has left me a little gassy.

702
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,427
I need a little me-time
at the ashram.

703
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,601
So...

704
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,437
<i>Auf Weidersen.</i> Congratulations.

705
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,142

You can just feel the boring.

707
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,364
Thank God.

708
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,954
Wait, where is the Truth Key?

709
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,000
Is it gone?

710
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,796
Just needed to borrow it.

711
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,673
Hey, guys.

712
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,851
Josh. You never called me back.

713
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,554
The old me was a dick that way.

714
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,285
Really?

715
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,136
I missed a lot, didn't I?

716
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,718
Yep.
