1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,367
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,541
No more magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,250
and I get my kingdom back.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,582
We are gonna hunt down

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,962
every last living slaver,

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,046
<i>and hang them
by their own entrails.</i>

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,261
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,843
Ember gave her the ability
to create a time loop.

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,937
A time loop.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,603
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,180
How many times have I died?

12
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,641
Thirty-nine... the Alice
from the 23rd timeline

13
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,068
was the sole survivor
of The Beast.

14
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,191
- We need to talk to her.
- Well, you can't.

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,943
<i>Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?</i>

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

17
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,235
I thought I'd never
see you again.

18
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,116
The Beast, he...
He tore you apart,

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,163
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,116
but your...
Your Shade, everything.

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,044
I have
sexually-transmitted lycanthropy.

22
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,495
It's totally curable.

23
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,582
- There is no actual cure.
- A silver bullet.

24
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,383
These are my students,
they are in need

25
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,801
of the Rhinemann Ultra.

26
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast...</i>

27
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,141
<i>It will kill anyone
including your Beast.</i>

28
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,748
So, you wanna tell me where you
hooked up with your partner?

29
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,772
Fillory.

30
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,848
If he smells you again,
he won't show.

31
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,353
If you want him,

32
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,435
<i>you mightjust have
to risk losing your base.</i>

33
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,148
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

34
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,357
Yes.

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,095
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,156
Without the key,
everything collapses,

37
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,238
which is why we can
never give it to you.

38
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,241
I don't know what they
think is going on with my nose.

39
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,913
Yeah, and those
are not my teeth.

40
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,042
And only 1,000 Fillorian
Gold Crescents for us?

41
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,089
Tick is cheap.
It'll be his downfall.

42
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,041
- I'll kill him.
- Who you gonna kill?

43
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,468
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

44
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,671
Your incursion
into the throne room

45
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,505
put that cheapskate
on red alert.

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,057
Wait, we're on there too?

47
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,679
You're kings
and queens of Fillory,

48
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,180
so you're a threat to his reign.

49
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,307
Yeah, well, so was Josh.

50
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,683
I don't see his face on there.

51
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,686
He was more like a substitute
teacher, didn't count.

52
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,768
We got news.
Uh, Julia sent a bunny.

53
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,570
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

54
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,314
Fucking what?

55
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,358
Hold on, so, on Earth,

56
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,195
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is...

57
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,404
A good guy, kind of?

58
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,576
Uh-uh. You know what?

59
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,458
Fuck Tinkerbitch.
Fuck her right in the Egg McMuffin.

60
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,792
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

61
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,965
Unfortunately,
she's as helpful as pubic lice.

62
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,209
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

63
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,447
and I think we should
do it in person.

64
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,337
Sorry, but we're all wanted,

65
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,390
and Tick's just stepped up the patrols
around the portal tree.

66
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,703
Well, why don't we
just send one of us?

67
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,871
It'll be easier
to break through.

68
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,431
- I'll do it.
- You can't.

69
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,228
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

70
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,058
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

71
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,359
It doesn't taste like horse...

72
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,695
What?

73
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,401
Jesus, fuck.

74
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,369
I'm...

75
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,947
I'm much too sober for all this.

76
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,748
Yeah, well, you have to hear it.

77
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,200
A lot of the McAllistairs
are dead,

78
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,501
but Irene is still out there,

79
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,147
and I don't know
what she's going to do.

80
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,505
Slavery, mass murder...

81
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,335
And yet, it smells
so floral in here.

82
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,590
Lucier's cleaning charm.

83
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,884
Next time, try less rosewater.

84
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,142
Any idea about
how to deal with Irene,

85
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,265
who will doubtless
want her property back?

86
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,479
Well, she'll
have to find it first.

87
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,814
Did you poke out her eyes?

88
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,187
No.

89
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,153
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

90
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,276
You did what? By yourself?

91
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,652
That's impossible.

92
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,404
That's apparently
what I can do now.

93
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,826
My magic's been growing,

94
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,825
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

95
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,328
This is new territory for me.

96
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,830
Me too.

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,708
Well, look, the school's yours
again, if you want it.

98
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,706
Sober up.

99
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,923
'Sup.

100
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,049
So, the Fairy Queen
can't give us the Sixth Key.

101
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,427
The Fairy Realm
will collapse without it.

102
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,179
Well, that blows.

103
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,812
Honestly, my instructions
ended at talk to Julia.

104
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,190
So what are we
supposed to do now?

105
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,357
Uh...

106
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,238
How did we end up
at Burning Man?

107
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,241
We're inside a Tesla Flexion.

108
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,491
Is that a car?

109
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,824
A device that allows you to
communicate across timelines.

110
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,997
Like, alternate
universes-type shit?

111
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,504
Like alternate
universes-type shit.

112
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,502
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

113
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,959
Usual paradox/explosion
problems?

114
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,759
Someone cast this
to pull us inside.

115
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,257
We just need to find out who.

116
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,926
Thank God, it worked.

117
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,361
Holy mirror universes, Batman.

118
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,783
It's me.

119
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,202
Like, you're me...

120
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,349
Okay, calm your shit.
I'm from a different timeline.

121
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,013
You're in a Tesla Flexion,
we only have...

122
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,374
Two minutes. We know the rules.

123
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,621
Right. Of course.

124
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,351
You pulled Alice
into one of these before.

125
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,003
Wait, you're from
that same timeline?

126
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,484
That's right. Look,
we need your help.

127
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,295
There's this monster here
killing Magicians.

128
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,384
We call him The Beast.

129
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,586
12 fingers?
Cloud of moths around his face?

130
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,840
Yeah, I tried to get people

131
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,513
to call him Mothra...
Didn't stick.

132
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,056
Here either,
can't expect everyone

133
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,883
to be down with
the Kaiju classics.

134
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,639
Okay, guys, two minutes, right?

135
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,812
Right, uh, problem is,
magic vanished.

136
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,542
These plumber guys
showed up one day and just...

137
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,807
Shut it off like a faucet.

138
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,517
Here, too.

139
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,227
But you guys have no idea why?

140
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,857
No clue, except the problem is,

141
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,985
we lost magic,
but The Beast didn't.

142
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,407
He was suddenly unstoppable.

143
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,609
I don't understand.

144
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,819
So magic is gone,

145
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,075
but then how does
he still have it?

146
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,781
Dude, I don't know.

147
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,686
Maybe it has something to do
with this key around his neck.

148
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,121
Wait, what key?

149
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,623
Uh, about yea big.

150
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,579
Rumor is, it gives him
visions of the future.

151
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,882
Visions of the future...
None of our keys do that.

152
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,800
Look, Julia, in my timeline,

153
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,878
you were the best student
Brakebills ever had

154
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,338
until you were
horribly murdered.

155
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,888
- Oh.
- But with your help,

156
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,887
we might stand a chance
against Mothra.

157
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,435
And Josh, well, you're me.

158
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,395
No argument there.

159
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,517
Shit, uh, please...

160
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,835
You have to find
a way back here.

161
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,127
This is our most desperate hour.

162
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,267
Help us, Julia and Josh.

163
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,647
You're our only hope.

164
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,361
Ended on a <i>Star Wars</i> reference?

165
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,682
He really knew how to get to me.

166
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,947
We're his new hope.

167
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,202
All I'm saying is,
can we even trust him?

168
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,659
Of course we can trust him.

169
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,913
It's me.

170
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,916
I would know if I was lying.

171
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,463
You said we can't
get the Sixth Key,

172
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,710
and visions of the future?

173
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,507
That has to be the seventh.

174
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,051
Any reason we gotta
do this in order?

175
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,378
I don't know.

176
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,463
Up until now, the book told us
where to go,

177
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,765
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

178
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,131
about where to find
the next one.

179
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,097
Well, maybe this time,
we flip it.

180
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,179
The key quest
has been Q's thing.

181
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,230
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

182
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,855
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

183
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,881
and see what he and the others
have to say about it.

184
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,568
Fine, but I will freely admit
I was getting excited

185
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,115
at the idea of a Josh-Julia
solo adventure.

186
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,487
Sorry.

187
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,570
Yeah, what would
the shippers even call us?

188
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,531
Josh? Julia? See?

189
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,227
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

190
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,537
Nope.

191
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,133
Where's the portal?

192
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,964
What happened?

193
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,596
The Time Key sent us to the lab.

194
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,383
Not our lab.

195
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,763
This place is a wreck.

196
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,266
Damn, that was fast.

197
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,768
We're in Timeline 23.

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,896
Act out.

199
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,566
This doesn't make sense.

200
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,523
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

201
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,700
It just decided
to send us back here?

202
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,118
What even are the rules?

203
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,204
Beats me...

204
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,888
- They're weirdly inconsistent.
- Uh-huh.

205
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,828
I guess we have some shit to
take care of in Timeline 23,

206
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,580
maybe key-related.

207
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,502
It worked! They're here!

208
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,458
Marina?

209
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,087
Holy shit.

210
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,919
Wait, you know her?

211
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,426
Of course I do,
she was a year ahead of me,

212
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,973
and hot, um...

213
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,972
Okay, I know you by reputation,

214
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,224
but how do you know me?

215
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,930
I don't know you here?

216
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,185
No.

217
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,937
You went to Brakebills,

218
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,984
I'm a hedge witch, we don't mix.

219
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,108
So, what happened
in your timeline?

220
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,948
Um... I didn't go to Brakebills,

221
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,617
so we became friends.

222
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,990
Friends?

223
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,824
That does not sound like me.

224
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,656
Wait, you didn't
go to Brakebills?

225
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,538
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

226
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,335
Alternate timeline
shit is weird.

227
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,503
Tell me about it.

228
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,875
Why don't we go somewhere safer?

229
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,377
We can talk about all this.

230
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,835
Jesus, place hasn't looked

231
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,795
this partied out
since my first year.

232
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,427
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

233
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,342
No clue, how about in yours?

234
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,474
A god was killed by a human.

235
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,187
The old gods took it away
as punishment.

236
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,436
Bunch of Mount
Olympus-sized dicks.

237
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,109
And magic going out here
was the beginning of the end for us.

238
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,715
That Beast started
killing Magicians...

239
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,863
First Brakebills,
then the hedge witches.

240
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,815
So, we joined forces to survive.

241
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,281
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

242
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,954
is Brakebills really the safest place
for us to hang out?

243
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,998
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

244
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,495
Thinks everyone's dead.

245
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,669
We have scoured
what's left of the place

246
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,168
looking for a way to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

247
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,919
That's how we found
the Tesla Flexion,

248
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,466
and a battery to cast it.

249
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,009
And this sweet jacket.

250
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,462
It's not magic,
but might as well be.

251
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,467
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

252
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,514
Julia can...

253
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,971
Uh, tell you about it herself.

254
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,022
And it's not even...
It's not even big news.

255
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,599
I don't know why I said that...

256
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,019
Your Beast has some sort of key?

257
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,653
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,314
We need it.

259
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,573
You help us kill our Beast,

260
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,575
key is yours.

261
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,326
Deal.

262
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,529
Boom.

263
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,159
Let's celebrate, bitches...

264
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,907
Powerful women.

265
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,251
So, Marina, huh?

266
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,000
You know, I've always
had a crush on her.

267
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,171
I know.

268
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,293
Oh.

269
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,794
Right...

270
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,488
Hey, what happened
to the glasses?

271
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,548
Lasik.

272
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,097
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

273
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,300
You are the braver Josh.

274
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,176
I've been through some shit.

275
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,351
Tell.

276
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,807
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

277
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,061
I ended up stuck...

278
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,017
Stuck in the Neitherlands,
me too.

279
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,339
If the Physical Kids
hadn't shown up,

280
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,479
I don't know how long...

281
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,983
No one ever showed up for me.

282
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,899
No one made it out?

283
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,277
Some made it out,
they just forgot about me.

284
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,949
Dude.

285
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,956
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

286
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,160
I'd be a lone wolf...
Brave, heroic, solo.

287
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,911
Got Lasik,
found this sweet jacket,

288
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,337
and changed my fucking life.

289
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,539
Wow.

290
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,361
Is this like that time
when we got that.

291
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,626
Kangol hat in middle school

292
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,322
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

293
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,178
No, it's not like that at all.

294
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,638
Cool.

295
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,307
Inspiring.

296
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,474
And, uh...

297
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,927
Whew.

298
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,182
Did you...

299
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,522
Did you just roofie me?

300
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,276
Nighty-night.

301
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,621
What happened?

302
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,370
What the hell
are we tied up with?

303
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,825
It was Professor Sunderland's.

304
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,660
Wish I took more
classes with her.

305
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,792
Why are we all tied up?

306
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,628
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

307
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,175
until now.

308
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,672
We're gonna give you to him.

309
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,295
This is insane.

310
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,347
You can't trust The Beast.

311
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,914
What makes you think he'll
make a deal instead of killing you?

312
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,263
You.

313
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,596
When he showed up here with
his key killing everybody,

314
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,101
he kept asking for you.

315
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,784
I don't understand,
I thought I was dead here.

316
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,562
You are, it was actually
pretty confusing.

317
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,487
So, maybe the guy with
the face full of moths

318
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,406
isn't in the best place
psychologically.

319
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,442
But it gave me an idea.

320
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,072
Give The Beast what he wants...

321
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,870
Julia, from
an alternate timeline

322
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,663
in exchange
for leaving us alone.

323
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,165
And what about me?

324
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,537
Sorry, bro.

325
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,335
You're the Cedric Diggory
of this story.

326
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,458
At least he died looking hot.

327
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,172
The Beast should be here soon.

328
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,874
He can sense magic.

329
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,005
There's no way he'd miss
that Tesla Flexion.

330
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,969
You have another choice.

331
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,089
In our timeline,

332
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,266
we killed The Beast
using a spell...

333
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,593
The Rhinemann Ultra.

334
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,848
Yeah, I've heard of that.

335
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,184
Don't you need
god-level power to cast it?

336
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,071
Yeah, you do.

337
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,340
Also took care of your migraines

338
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,387
and smoking addiction...
You're welcome.

339
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,010
- How did you...
- Long story.

340
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,762
Act out.

341
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,010
Easy, cowboy.

342
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,645
I promise you, it's real.

343
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,515
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

344
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,271
So, what do you say?

345
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,448
You have this Rhinemann spell?

346
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,075
Dean Fogg will know where to
find it, if he's still alive.

347
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,614
Oh, he's still alive...

348
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,240
Not exactly the premier educator
he once was.

349
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,199
Kind of a walking opioid crisis.

350
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,581
I'll take you to him.

351
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,126
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

352
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,966
Enjoy swapping puberty stories.

353
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,256
They're the same stories.

354
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,263
So, you and Dean Fogg
are on good terms here?

355
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,164
I mean, he did kick me
out of Brakebills,

356
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,145
but he's warmed to me
a bit since then.

357
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,335
Nothing like watching all
of your students and friends

358
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,477
get murdered by a creature
from another world to open you up.

359
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,350
How do you know him? I thought
you didn't go to Brakebills.

360
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,981
It's complicated.

361
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,941
- You fucked him.
- No! What?

362
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,819
Okay, defensive much?

363
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,575
He's not that bad in bed...

364
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,868
Okay...

365
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,534
Hey, speaking of,

366
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,869
what's the deal with
you and me in your timeline?

367
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,121
I'm sensing some
weird kinda tension.

368
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,215
Is it the fun kind?

369
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,337
Like I said, we were friends.

370
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,677
It wasn't always fun.

371
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,255
We got into a big fight,

372
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,558
uh, but we ended up
kinda getting over it.

373
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
That's it?

374
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,690
From your face,
I was expecting something a little more...

375
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,108
Dramatic.

376
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,353
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

377
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,694
This way?

378
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,416
Marina.

379
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,493
Oh, come on.

380
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,747
I won't steal anything
from you this time.

381
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,010
What did you steal
from me last time?

382
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,509
Nothing, just forget
I said anything.

383
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,510
Just... I found an
old student of yours, okay?

384
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,625
Come in.

385
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,624
Timeline 40?

386
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,467
I have to live through
another 17 more of these.

387
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,182
Uh, you don't remember them all?

388
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,975
Only the ones
I've been through already.

389
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,348
I thought 22 was
absolutely dreadful,

390
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,979
until this one.

391
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,485
Is that really necessary?

392
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,064
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

393
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,241
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

394
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,692
No, it doesn't.

395
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,995
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

396
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,578
Ah, yes, the Rhinemann Ultra.

397
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,374
My friend Bigby had that.

398
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,497
Unfortunately, she's dead.

399
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,915
Everything went to shit
when magic died.

400
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,169
Creatures got set upon,

401
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,003
chopped up to steal their mojo.

402
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,303
That poor thing.

403
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,718
I killed a leprechaun once.

404
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,478
I'm not proud.

405
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,857
Just saying.

406
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,479
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

407
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,110
You wouldn't happen
to know where Bigby kept it?

408
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,197
The spell?

409
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,613
I don't.

410
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,741
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

411
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,319
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

412
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,406
but I sent two students
to see her.

413
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,202
They died.

414
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,000
Seems to be a bit of a theme.

415
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,327
There's good news.

416
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,333
You see, their deaths were,

417
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,836
well, earth-shatteringly
horrible.

418
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,043
I mean, really awful...

419
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,378
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

420
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,431
Wait, so how is this good news?

421
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,725
Because they're ghosts, dear.

422
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,308
They still haunt the Library,
last I checked...

423
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,638
Pretty deep in the stacks.

424
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,848
They might remember the spell.

425
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,107
But I'd be careful
if I were you.

426
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,032
Ghosts, well,
ghosts can be dangerous.

427
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,493
Yeah.

428
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,449
How could you
do this to me, man?

429
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,120
You're me, I'm you, we're us.

430
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,700
I would never betray myself.

431
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,396
You haven't been through
what I've been through.

432
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,457
Yes, I have, except the Lasik.

433
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:29,880
There's more than that.

434
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,132
Whatever.

435
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,753
You know, I thought
you were cool

436
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,254
and brave.

437
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,552
And I dug your jacket,

438
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,470
but now I just think
you're a dick,

439
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,514
which sucks,
because that means I'm a dick.

440
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,425
What do you expect?

441
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,885
My friends abandoned me.

442
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,140
Maybe they were right too.

443
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,935
What, did you
roofie and betray them too?

444
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,185
No.

445
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,920
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

446
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,606
How do you know
what you're gonna do?

447
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,902
The Quickening?

448
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,480
What's the Quickening?

449
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,235
I can't think about it.

450
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,636
I don't want all their blood
on my hands.

451
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,367
What the hell is the Quickening?

452
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,864
Nothing you need to worry about.

453
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,571
Just be glad you
didn't bang a werewolf.

454
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,145
Let's talk about
something else, okay?

455
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,415
Now I need an aspirin.

456
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,374
Yeah, the Library got ransacked

457
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,801
after The Beast took out
most of the school.

458
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,129
Honestly, I did
most of the ransacking,

459
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,306
but I didn't see any ghosts.

460
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,437
Eliot, holy shit!

461
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,602
What the hell was that?

462
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,643
I think I know
the students who died here.

463
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,020
- Eliot and...
- Margo?

464
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,405
I told you we need to
get our shit together, Eliot.

465
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,908
I have my shit together.

466
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,332
No, you're holding
your shit together, barely.

467
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,909
There's a difference.

468
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,542
Don't let that pixie twat
Bigby get in your head.

469
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,464
She called me a lush,

470
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,509
which is basically just
a nice way of saying alcoholic.

471
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,846
And she said
I couldn't handle the spell.

472
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,469
Why don't you prove her wrong
and help me, okay?

473
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,890
What are we doing?

474
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,680
Well, before we
can do the Rhinemann,

475
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,182
we need a power-up.

476
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,560
Here is a cooperative spell.

477
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,733
Now, if we can
cast this together,

478
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,231
it might just give us
enough juice to kill The Beast.

479
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,358
And if we cast it wrong,

480
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,113
kaboom.

481
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,780
So, let's not cast it wrong.

482
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,578
What if Bigby was right?

483
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,576
What if I am too drunk?

484
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,283
What if I screw it up?

485
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,543
Ooh.

486
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,162
You are not gonna
cock out on me.

487
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,463
Cock out?

488
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,542
I'd say pussy,
but let's be honest.

489
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,422
Which one is tougher?

490
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,087
Point made.

491
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,685
Oh, God, oh, God...

492
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,359
I screwed up, I screwed up,

493
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,489
I screwed up, I screwed...

494
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:16,289
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up,

495
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,873
I screwed it up...

496
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,327
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up...

497
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,511
Bambi?

498
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,759
Where's my Bambi?

499
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,758
Where's my Bambi?

500
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Come on. Oh!

501
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,266
Jesus Christ!

502
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,900
Cocks.

503
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,481
Oh, yuck, that was...

504
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,858
So yuck.

505
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,530
Not fun at all.

506
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,232
Please tell me
you got that spell.

507
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,735
Yeah, I think I can make it out.

508
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,239
I think someone is following us.

509
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,998
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

510
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,130
Okay.

511
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,967
Now!

512
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,258
That's your signal?

513
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,430
Penny?

514
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,844
Julia.

515
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,098
So, it is you.

516
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,643
You're real.

517
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,812
You're alive.

518
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,776
Whoa! Um, uh...

519
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,576
Julia, it's me.

520
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,662
Yeah, I know.

521
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:30,828
God, it's like I'm...

522
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,706
I'm living in a dream.

523
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,328
Just let me short-circuit this.

524
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,000
If you think following
two strangers

525
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,794
and then kissing one of them
is dream behavior...

526
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,247
She's not a stranger.

527
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,457
She's my soul mate.

528
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,836
Oh, God.

529
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,509
I'm...

530
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,054
I'm actually not your Julia.

531
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,889
You see, I'm from
a different timeline.

532
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,180
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

533
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,311
I'm sorry, I thought...

534
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,733
No, it's... It's okay.

535
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,028
When I heard a rumor that
The Beast was looking for her

536
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,695
even though she's dead, I...

537
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,114
It's crazy, but I...

538
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,949
I had to see.

539
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,069
I'm sorry.

540
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,449
It was stupid.

541
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,872
Julia, we gotta get out of here.

542
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,075
- Where are you going?
- To kill The Beast.

543
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,376
- Let me come with you.
- Okay, sorry, buddy,

544
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,190
but we got everything we need,
no baggage necessary.

545
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,955
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

546
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,417
He's a Traveler,
could come in handy.

547
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,338
Eye roll.

548
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,647
It's working, I can feel it.

549
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,274
It's just a lot
of moving pieces.

550
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,195
So...

551
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,780
What's up with me
in your timeline?

552
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,281
Well,

553
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,494
you're kind of
in the Underworld.

554
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,041
Not good.

555
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,715
I'm not sure
you're technically dead.

556
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,252
So, in the Underworld,
but not dead?

557
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,428
That sounds worse.

558
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,096
Truth is,

559
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,391
you got there because
you did something heroic.

560
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,061
Unlike my alternate self,
who's a dick,

561
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,731
possibly related
to self-esteem issues,

562
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,400
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

563
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,604
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

564
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,781
Here he comes.

565
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,994
Hey, can I ask you
one last time...

566
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,287
What is the Quickening?

567
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,080
No, you can't.

568
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,954
I don't wanna talk about
my private tragedy,

569
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,229
so unless you want me
to gag you...

570
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,745
Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

571
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,205
Don't call me Dick Josh.

572
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,006
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

573
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,918
I am not a dick.
I've had a harder life than you.

574
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,049
Did you? What makes you so sure?

575
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,426
Because you get
to hang out with Julia,

576
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,802
who is awesome,

577
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,931
and I get Marina,
who is mean all the time.

578
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,643
Then why do you
hang out with her?

579
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,859
Because when she dies,
it's not going to feel so bad.

580
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,853
Truth is, maybe my friends
abandoned me,

581
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,860
or maybe, I pushed them away.

582
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,192
Because whatever
this thing is that's looming...

583
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,695
Because unlike me,

584
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,823
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

585
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,259
Don't call me Dick Josh again.

586
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,266
Wow.

587
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,609
Oh, shit, we got company!

588
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
I hope you're ready.

589
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,908
Josh, go!

590
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,743
A Josh has to live
to tell our story.

591
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,795
Get back! Anything inside
of 20 feet will be ash!

592
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,849
Julia.

593
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,935
The key didn't lie.

594
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Q?

595
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,063
Getting a little sick
of plot twists.

596
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,516
Focus, we need
to get out of here.

597
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,521
I can travel,
but I can't take anyone with me

598
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,172
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

599
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,277
Let me try.

600
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:49,042
Quentin is The Beast.
Quentin is The Beast?

601
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,123
How the fuck
is Quentin The Beast?

602
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,503
Who's Quentin again?

603
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,090
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

604
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,699
to run away to Fillory
in the first place

605
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,930
and get murdered.

606
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,133
Yeah, by The Beast.

607
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,768
So, you see why
this is confusing?

608
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,142
Doesn't make any sense.

609
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,771
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

610
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,818
She said that
he tore out his Shade,

611
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,316
and destroyed him.

612
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,190
Uh, did he look
destroyed to any of you?

613
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,697
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

614
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,278
I didn't even think
that was possible.

615
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,862
You'd have to have
a lot of power,

616
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,197
like a god.

617
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,533
Oh, we are in such deep shit.

618
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,836
Maybe we should just stay here
in this branch of The Library.

619
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,964
Hey, Penny,
where are all the Librarians?

620
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,333
I don't know.

621
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,571
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

622
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,995
It's the first place I found where
I couldn't hear The Beast.

623
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,422
Now, is that The Beast beast,

624
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:44,100
or the Q Beast,
or is there another Beast?

625
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,099
I think we're missing
some pages of the story here

626
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,226
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

627
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,809
and Quentin is The Beast,
only more powerful.

628
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,644
I know who we should talk to...

629
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,481
The one person who tried
to bring Quentin back.

630
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,818
Do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

631
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,411
Um...

632
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,035
Is there an Alice Quinn
on this boat?

633
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,495
Other cabin.

634
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,792
Thanks.

635
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,459
I was going
to give up on Quentin.

636
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,921
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

637
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,221
and I couldn't reach it

638
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,390
until your Tesla Flexion
came through.

639
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,017
That changed everything.

640
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,559
Seeing him and hearing
that he loved me,

641
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,066
just knowing that
he was out there,

642
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,270
if only I could bring him back.

643
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,444
So, what did you do?

644
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,482
There's a creature
in the Northern Marsh

645
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,992
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

646
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,862
What kind of evil
creature-type deal

647
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,322
are we talking here?

648
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,284
When I die, I won't
go to the Underworld.

649
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,036
Now, I belong to him.

650
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,042
So, Harvey Weinstein-type evil.

651
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,004
So, um, what did he give you?

652
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,046
The power to bring
Quentin back without his Shade.

653
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,380
I was so heartbroken,

654
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,742
I thought that
maybe we could just

655
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,849
fix it together
once he returned.

656
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,687
It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

657
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,727
Without his Shade, he...

658
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,608
He wasn't Quentin.

659
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:16,977
No.

660
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,230
He wanted Fillory for himself.

661
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,403
So, he killed The Beast.

662
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,863
But that wasn't enough.

663
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,913
So, he found a way to kill
Ember, and steal his powers.

664
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,740
But because he killed a god...

665
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,042
The old gods took magic away.

666
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,330
Quentin still had the power
he stole from Ember.

667
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:42,001
He told me that Fillory was
the only thing that he truly loved.

668
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,887
It was always his escape.

669
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,177
He was afraid of magic,

670
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,019
of any Magician who
might bring it back.

671
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,221
Anyone who would oppose him,

672
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,397
take Fillory from him...

673
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,109
And the six fingers, moths...

674
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,111
How'd that shit happen?

675
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,859
I don't know.

676
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,156
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

677
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,453
that he was the only one

678
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,655
who appreciated
Fillory like he did.

679
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,158
I'm sorry.

680
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,270
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

681
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,078
I just... I loved Quentin.

682
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,084
And I wanted to see him again.

683
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,169
It's okay.

684
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,630
Hell no, it's not okay.

685
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,675
All of our friends died
because of you,

686
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,098
because of what you did.

687
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,433
Because of what I did.

688
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,304
Quentin and I used
the Tesla Flexion

689
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,060
to talk to her.

690
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,476
And if we hadn't,
Alice never would've tried

691
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,901
to bring her Quentin back,

692
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,854
and none of this
would've happened.

693
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,486
Whoa, whoa,
time travel headache.

694
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,992
Okay, so, what, just
because you gave her the sads,

695
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,348
it's somehow your fault
that she resurrected a crazy monster

696
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,225
who murdered everybody
and got magic turned off?

697
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,832
I mean, yeah, I guess
it's kind of a little bit your fault,

698
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,078
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

699
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,917
So, why you on this ship anyway?

700
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,293
What is with all the bunnies?

701
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,583
Are you trying to send a bunch
of messages or something?

702
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,877
No, I work for them.

703
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,554
They're radish smugglers, I...

704
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,097
I stack boxes.

705
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,890
It's the only thing
they can't do.

706
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,225
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

707
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,307
so I can try to fix my mistake.

708
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,607
How?

709
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,855
By finding a weapon
to kill Quentin.

710
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,444
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

711
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,072
I found this.

712
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,415
Don't ask me how.

713
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,553
Let me guess...
You traveled to the past

714
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,345
and made a deal
with a knife maker?

715
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,431
The only problem is,

716
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,184
I don't have enough power
to touch it.

717
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,612
I do.

718
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,871
I'll tell Captain Hopps
I'm leaving.

719
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,298
Found some carrot wine.

720
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,390
The other Josh

721
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,515
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

722
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,514
Something did...
He fucking died.

723
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,933
Yeah, but...

724
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,356
It's gonna happen to me too.

725
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,113
Whatever the holy hell
was gonna happen to him

726
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,565
that he never goddamn told me

727
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,991
because I never
got past the part,

728
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,740
it's called the Quickening,

729
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,196
'cause that's not ominous.

730
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:01,117
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

731
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,627
That's what I always heard too.

732
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,214
Turns out, it's murder herpes.

733
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,551
So, yay.

734
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,298
If I find out I may turn into
a monster and kill everyone,

735
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,261
I'd run far away.

736
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,349
'Cause if you're near Julia
when that happens,

737
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,973
I'll kill you myself, Dick Josh.

738
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,327
- We can't do that.
- But it totally works.

739
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,155
We pop in, we throw Alice
to The Beast,

740
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,768
and when he's munching
on her entrails,

741
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,375
Penny pops you behind and you
stab Q-bert in the back.

742
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,670
Marina, I'm not going
to use Alice as bait.

743
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,417
Why not? I mean, you heard her.

744
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,623
This is all her fault,

745
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,504
she wants to fix
what she screwed up.

746
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,672
There are ways to do this

747
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,004
without sacrificing
her life, okay?

748
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,576
Are you getting cold feet
because The Beast

749
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,680
is your former best friend,

750
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,309
the unimpressive white guy?

751
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,806
No, it's not that.

752
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,791
Because people have
already died in this timeline.

753
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,351
Basically, everyone I know...

754
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,684
They're dead because
of short, blonde, and crazy,

755
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,143
and I guess you.

756
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,590
But why would you
give a shit about that?

757
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,196
You just want your stupid key.

758
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,161
I tried to kill a god once
with help from a friend...

759
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,743
You.

760
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,706
I used you as bait to lure him.

761
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,249
And when I couldn't
get back in time,

762
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,835
he killed you.

763
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,130
I screwed up, and you died.

764
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,884
And it was horrible.

765
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,886
Jesus Christ.

766
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,390
I'm so sorry.

767
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,856
I couldn't tell you
before because

768
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,690
it was my fault.

769
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,316
And I can never do that
to someone again.

770
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,446
So, what do you wanna do?

771
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,823
I mean, this shit is dangerous.

772
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,654
We can't just
waltz up on The Beast.

773
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,579
He may act like a beast, but,

774
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,332
deep down, he's the Quentin
I've always known.

775
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,755
So, what are you saying?
You wanna spare him?

776
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,797
I wanna use that against him.

777
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:37,862
Wow. He really let the place go.

778
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,571
What is all this shit?

779
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,115
The Winter's Doe...

780
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,243
What's left of her.

781
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,121
Jesus, did he eat her?

782
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,167
These are the polished rocks
from the Silver Banks.

783
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,386
That's where Martin Chatwin
learned to skip rocks.

784
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,134
This is a bugle from Brass City.

785
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,852
Rupert learned to play on this.

786
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,390
- You guys, this isn't trash.
- No.

787
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,853
This is a "Fillory and Further"
fan boy's collection.

788
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,196
It's trash.

789
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,361
Quentin's been hoarding this.

790
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,501
You're not a very good player,

791
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,927
whoever you are.

792
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,223
Hilarious.

793
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,352
Alice?

794
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,980
I can smell you.

795
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,741
Why don't you come on out?

796
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,988
He knows I'm here.

797
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,695
Hurry, quick, let's go.

798
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,996
I'm trying.

799
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,869
Shit, he must've cast a ward.

800
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,245
I can't travel
into the throne room.

801
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,170
Fine, you don't wanna come out?

802
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,665
Then I will...

803
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,504
Fill the room with fire.

804
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,638
You guys stay, I'll go.

805
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,840
No, Alice, don't.

806
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:26,934
I have to.

807
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,387
If I don't,
he'll kill all of us.

808
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,436
I'm here, Quentin.

809
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,074
Wait.

810
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,901
I am the only one
who can stop him.

811
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,420
I made a mistake.

812
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,089
I should never
have run from you.

813
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,382
That's what I said.

814
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,089
You killed every
Magician you could find,

815
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,671
except me.

816
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,595
Why?

817
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,097
I thought about it,
but you were doing

818
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,179
such a good job
of torturing yourself.

819
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,807
And the others, I...

820
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,435
I could say that
they were a threat,

821
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,646
but honestly, I just realized

822
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,481
that I didn't
like them very much.

823
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,404
Doesn't sound like you.

824
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,696
I know you.

825
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,496
You knew me.

826
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,074
You're not Martin Chatwin,

827
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,080
you're not The Beast...
You hate The Beast.

828
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,411
True.

829
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,668
But you show up
with a face full of moths,

830
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,545
and everyone loses their shit.

831
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,135
People think that The Beast

832
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,509
is invincible.

833
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,103
Who wouldn't use that
to their advantage?

834
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,778
I think that he
would be flattered.

835
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,654
I did a Dread Pirate Roberts.

836
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,951
<i>The Princess Bride.</i>

837
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,989
Please, Quentin.

838
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,492
I know the man that I love
is still inside you somewhere.

839
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,248
Yeah, I ate him.

840
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,080
Okay, this is obviously

841
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,712
a ploy to buy your friends time,

842
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,362
so why don't we just
get this over with?

843
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,307
That's a familiar scent.

844
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:40,776
Julia.

845
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,071
You can't kill me,
you've already tried.

846
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,283
What did you...

847
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,576
What did you do to me?

848
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,956
It's my Shade.

849
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,545
And I can live
without it if I have to.

850
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,007
Everything that you
are feeling right now,

851
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,462
I have felt...
Grief, sadness, shame, regret.

852
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,717
Q?

853
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,468
Alice.

854
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,689
I killed her.

855
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,479
I'm so sorry.

856
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,443
Q?

857
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,072
Where did you find the key?

858
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,073
Um...

859
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,094
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

860
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,791
and I couldn't have that,

861
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,167
so I got it first.

862
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,081
I know why
you were looking for me.

863
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,586
The key...

864
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,759
It showed you
visions of the future...

865
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,179
Me killing you.

866
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,257
Julia...

867
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,716
I'm here to tell you I'm not.

868
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,556
I'm not going to kill you.

869
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,355
I wanna help you.

870
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,517
The visions weren't
of you killing me.

871
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,276
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

872
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,650
You were trying to let magic in,

873
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,656
but you let in
something much worse.

874
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,320
What?

875
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,497
A monster.

876
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,452
One even worse than me.

877
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,755
You should take your Shade back.

878
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,118
You look dumb.

879
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,460
I'm trying to get this
stupid key to open up a door.

880
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,592
Well, isn't there, like,
some kind of ritual for that?

881
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,340
- Or...
- It would be nice

882
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,093
if there was,
but, no, so key-waving.

883
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,517
Is that my Josh's jacket?

884
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,806
Yeah.

885
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:22,932
Hmm.

886
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,851
You look cooler.

887
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,894
You are mean.

888
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,241
So, the key show you anything?

889
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,070
Visions of the future?

890
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,366
Nothing.

891
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,913
Okay.

892
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,453
Then I guess you don't know
that I'm coming with you.

893
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,253
What?

894
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,044
Your Penny's dead, or,

895
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,082
not alive in some confusing way.

896
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,091
Penny, I don't...

897
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,634
I'm not asking permission.

898
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,300
Okay.

899
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,761
I'm not her.

900
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,676
I know that.

901
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,934
It's just, there's
nothing here for me.

902
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,356
But there?

903
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,145
Give it time.

904
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,645
Hey, uh, Jules?

905
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,106
We have a door.

906
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,657
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

907
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,747
I honestly don't know.
