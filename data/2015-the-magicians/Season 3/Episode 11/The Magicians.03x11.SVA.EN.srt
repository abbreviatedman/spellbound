1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,523
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,645
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

3
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:06,496
and I get my kingdom back.

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,042
We are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>and hang them by their own entrails.</i>

6
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,426
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

7
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:18,517
Ember gave her the ability
to create a time loop.

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,018
A time loop.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,887
So far, all the loops
ends in your death.

10
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,455
How many times have I died?

11
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,924
39... the Alice from the 23rd timeline

12
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,126
was the sole survivor of The Beast.

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,462
- We need to talk to her.
- Well, you can't.

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,030
<i>Well, what about a Tesla Flexion?</i>

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,666
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

16
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,501
I thought I'd never see you again.

17
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,170
The Beast, he... he tore you apart,

18
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,439
piece by piece, but not just your body,

19
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,374
but your... your Shade, everything.

20
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,310
Oh! I have sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy.

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,313
It's totally curable.

22
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:49,848
- There is no actual cure.
- A silver bullet.

23
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,650
These are my students, they are in need

24
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,118
of the Rhinemann Ultra.

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,054
No one but you can be within
20 feet of the blast...

26
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:59,743
<i>It will kill anyone
including your Beast.</i>

27
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,969
So, you wanna tell me where you
hooked up with your partner?

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,996
Fillory.

29
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,031
If he smells you again, he won't show.

30
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,566
If you want him,

31
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,401
<i>you might just have
to risk losing your base.</i>

32
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,038
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,133
Yes.

34
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:15,974
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

35
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,143
Without the key, everything collapses,

36
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,412
which is why we can
never give it to you.

37
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,383
I don't know what they think
is going on with my nose.

38
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,884
Yeah, and those are not my teeth.

39
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:29,054
And only 1,000 Fillorian
gold crescents for us?

40
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,089
Tick is cheap. It'll be his downfall.

41
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,258
- I'll kill him.
- Who you gonna kill?

42
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,752
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

43
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,895
Your incursion into the throne room

44
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,697
put that cheapskate on red alert.

45
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,065
Wait, we're on there too?

46
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,900
You're Kings and Queens of Fillory,

47
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,402
so you're a threat to his reign.

48
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,904
Yeah, well, so was Josh.
I don't see his face on there.

49
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,725
He was more like a substitute
teacher, didn't count.

50
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,976
We got news... Julia sent a bunny.

51
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,979
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

52
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,514
Fucking what?

53
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,249
<i>Hold on, so, on Earth,</i>

54
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,385
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is...

55
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,758
- A good guy, kind of?
- Uh-uh, you know what?

56
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,135
Fuck Tinkerbitch.

57
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:06,813
Fuck her right in the Egg McMuffin.

58
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:10,250
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

59
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,133
Unfortunately,
she's as helpful as pubic lice.

60
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:15,406
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

61
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,469
- and I think we should do it in person.
- Sorry, but we're all wanted,

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,573
and Tick's just stepped up the
patrols around the portal tree.

63
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:24,272
Why don't we just send one of us?
It'll be easier to break through.

64
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,409
- I'll do it.
- You can't.

65
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,477
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

66
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:30,355
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

67
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:33,091
It doesn't taste like horse...

68
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,862
What?

69
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:40,870
<i>Jesus, fuck.</i>

70
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,806
I'm...

71
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:45,103
I'm much too sober for all this.

72
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:47,205
Yeah, well, you have to hear it.

73
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,792
A lot of the McAllisters are dead,
but Irene is still out there,

74
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,476
and I don't know what she's going to do.

75
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:53,979
Slavery, mass murder...

76
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:57,917
and yet, it smells so floral in here.

77
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,722
Lucier's cleaning charm.

78
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,234
Next time, try less rosewater.

79
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,324
Any idea about how to deal with Irene,

80
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,659
who will doubtless
want her property back?

81
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:10,062
Well, she'll have to find it first.

82
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,230
Did you poke out her eyes?

83
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:13,434
No.

84
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,309
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

85
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,521
You did what? By yourself?

86
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,063
That's impossible.

87
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,707
That's apparently what I can do now.

88
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,208
My magic's been growing,

89
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,153
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

90
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:29,748
This is new territory for me.

91
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,249
Me too.

92
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:34,059
Well, look, the school's
yours again, if you want it.

93
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,129
Sober up.

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,332
'Sup.

95
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,330
So, the Fairy Queen
can't give us the Sixth Key.

96
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:47,833
The Fairy Realm
will collapse without it.

97
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:51,536
Well, that blows.

98
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:54,239
Honestly, my instructions
ended at talk to Julia.

99
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,409
So what are we supposed to do now?

100
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:04,549
How did we end up at Burning Man?

101
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:06,475
We're inside a Tesla Flexion.

102
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:07,561
Is that a car?

103
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:10,188
A device that allows you to
communicate across timelines.

104
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,091
Like, alternate universes-type shit?

105
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:15,827
Like alternate universes-type shit.

106
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,829
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

107
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,065
Usual paradox/explosion problems?

108
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,933
Someone cast this to pull us inside.

109
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:23,602
We just need to find out who.

110
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:29,272
Thank God, it worked.

111
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:43,681
- Holy mirror universes,
Batman.

112
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,290
It's me.

113
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,225
Like, you're me...

114
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:49,394
Okay, calm your shit.
I'm from a different timeline.

115
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:51,096
You're in a Tesla Flexion,
we only have...

116
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,631
Two minutes. We know the rules.

117
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,400
Right. Of course. You pulled
Alice into one of these before.

118
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,135
Wait, you're from that same timeline?

119
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,668
That's right. Look, we need your help.

120
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,605
There's this monster here
killing Magicians.

121
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,460
- We call him The Beast.
- 12 fingers?

122
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,671
Cloud of moths around his face?

123
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:06,678
Yeah, I tried to get people to
call him Mothra... didn't stick.

124
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,981
Here either, can't expect everyone
to be down with the Kaiju classics.

125
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,783
Okay, guys, two minutes, right?

126
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,941
Right, uh, problem is, magic vanished.

127
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:15,812
These plumber guys
showed up one day and just...

128
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,089
Shut it off like a faucet.

129
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:20,258
Here, too. But you
guys have no idea why?

130
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,060
No clue, except the problem is,

131
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,995
we lost magic, but The Beast didn't.

132
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,397
He was suddenly unstoppable.

133
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,966
I don't understand.

134
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:31,241
So magic is gone, but then
how does he still have it?

135
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:32,780
Dude, I don't know.

136
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,878
Maybe it has something to do
with this key around his neck.

137
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,374
Wait, what key?

138
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:37,843
About yea big.

139
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:40,029
Rumor is, it gives him
visions of the future.

140
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,481
Visions of the future...
none of our keys do that.

141
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:44,049
Look, Julia, in my timeline,

142
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,917
you were the best student
Brakebills ever had

143
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,352
until you were horribly murdered.

144
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,121
- Oh.
- But with your help,

145
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:50,889
we might stand a chance against Mothra.

146
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,525
And Josh, well, you're me.

147
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,559
No argument there.

148
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,996
Shit, uh, please... you have
to find a way back here.

149
00:05:57,998 --> 00:05:59,498
This is our most desperate hour.

150
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,519
Help us, Julia and Josh.
You're our only hope.

151
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,542
Ended on a "Star Wars" reference?

152
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,978
He really knew how to get to me.
We're his new hope.

153
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,180
All I'm saying is,
can we even trust him?

154
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:17,949
Of course we can trust him. It's me.

155
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,951
I would know if I was lying.

156
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:22,888
You said we can't get the Sixth
Key, and visions of the future?

157
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,656
That has to be the seventh.

158
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,258
Any reason we gotta do this in order?

159
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,526
I don't know.

160
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,427
Up until now,
the book told us where to go,

161
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:31,930
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

162
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:35,267
- about where to find the next one.
- Well, maybe this time, we flip it.

163
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,169
The key quest has been Q's thing.

164
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:39,204
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

165
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,979
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

166
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,077
and see what he and the others
have to say about it.

167
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:46,726
Fine, but I will freely admit
I was getting excited

168
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,314
at the idea of
a Josh-Julia solo adventure.

169
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,615
Sorry.

170
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,484
Yeah, what would
the shippers even call us?

171
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:55,487
Josh? Julia? See?

172
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,728
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

173
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:58,999
Nope.

174
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,232
Where's the portal?

175
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,603
What happened?

176
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:12,206
The time key sent us to the lab.

177
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,842
Not our lab.

178
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:16,000
This place is a wreck.

179
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,929
Damn, that was fast.

180
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,216
We're in Timeline 23.

181
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:24,084
Act out.

182
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,413
This doesn't make sense.

183
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:28,183
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

184
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,488
It just decided to send us back here?

185
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,931
What even are the rules?

186
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,550
Beats me...
they're weirdly inconsistent.

187
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:37,637
I guess we have some shit
to take care of in Timeline 23,

188
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,339
maybe key-related.

189
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,441
It worked! They're here!

190
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,279
Marina?

191
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,747
Holy shit.

192
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,616
Wait, you know her?

193
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:52,252
Of course I do,
she was a year ahead of me,

194
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,032
and hot, um...

195
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,756
Okay, I know you by reputation,

196
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:59,092
but how do you know me?

197
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,760
I don't know you here?

198
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,128
No.

199
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,663
You went to Brakebills,

200
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:05,598
I'm a hedge witch, we don't mix.

201
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,067
So, what happened in your timeline?

202
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,204
Um, I didn't go to Brakebills,

203
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:13,306
so we became friends.

204
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:14,741
Friends?

205
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,776
That does not sound like me.

206
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,425
Wait, you didn't go to Brakebills?

207
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:21,281
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

208
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,082
Alternate timeline shit is weird.

209
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:24,162
Tell me about it.

210
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:27,006
Why don't we go somewhere safer?
We can talk about all this.

211
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:32,792
Jesus, place hasn't looked this
partied out since my first year.

212
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,195
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

213
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:37,096
No clue, how about in yours?

214
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,999
A God was killed by a human.

215
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,768
The Old Gods took it away as punishment.

216
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,180
Bunch of Mount Olympus-sized dicks.

217
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,806
And magic going out here was the
beginning of the end for us.

218
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,609
That Beast started killing Magicians...

219
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,510
first Brakebills,
then the hedge witches.

220
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,745
So, we joined forces to survive.

221
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:55,748
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

222
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,687
is Brakebills really the safest
place for us to hang out?

223
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,781
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

224
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,358
Thinks everyone's dead.

225
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,535
We have scoured what's left of the place

226
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,238
looking for away to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

227
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,007
That's how we found the Tesla Flexion,

228
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,408
and a battery to cast it.

229
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,034
And this sweet jacket.

230
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:14,345
It's not magic, but might as well be.

231
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:18,716
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

232
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,218
Julia can...

233
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,710
Uh, tell you about it herself.

234
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,989
And it's not even...
it's not even big news.

235
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,758
I don't know why I said that...

236
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,227
Your Beast has some sort of key?

237
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,269
We need it.

238
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,592
You help us kill our Beast,

239
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:37,049
key is yours.

240
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,226
Deal.

241
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:39,241
Boom.

242
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,219
Let's celebrate, bitches...

243
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,124
Powerful women.

244
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,793
So, Marina, huh?

245
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,694
You know,
I've always had a crush on her.

246
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:48,862
I know.

247
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:51,832
Oh, right...

248
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,267
Hey, what happened to the glasses?

249
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,002
Lasik.

250
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,771
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

251
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,141
You are the braver Josh.

252
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:02,076
I've been through some shit.

253
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:03,377
Tell.

254
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,580
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

255
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:09,850
- I ended up stuck...
- Stuck in the Neitherlands, me too.

256
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:12,301
If the Physical Kids hadn't shown
up, I don't know how long...

257
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,178
No one ever showed up for me.

258
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,923
No one made it out?

259
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:19,326
Some made it out,
they just forgot about me.

260
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,794
Dude.

261
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,630
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

262
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:26,934
I'd be a lone wolf...
brave, heroic, solo.

263
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:30,137
Got Lasik, found this sweet jacket,
and changed my fucking life.

264
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,503
Wow.

265
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:34,183
Is this like that time when we got
that Kangol hat in middle school

266
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:36,003
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

267
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:38,145
No, it's not like that at all.

268
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:39,713
Cool.

269
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,148
Inspiring.

270
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,316
And, uh...

271
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,019
Did you...

272
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,022
Did you just roofie me?

273
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:57,277
Nighty-night.

274
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,604
What happened?

275
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,973
What the hell are we tied up with?

276
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,493
It was Professor Sunderland's.

277
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:09,837
Wish I took more classes with her.

278
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,539
Why are we all tied up?

279
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,509
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

280
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,977
until now.

281
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,612
We're gonna give you to him.

282
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,714
This is insane.

283
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,015
You can't trust The Beast.

284
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:23,751
What makes you think he'll make
a deal instead of killing you?

285
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:25,096
You.

286
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:28,369
When he showed up here with
his key killing everybody,

287
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,480
he kept asking for you.

288
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:32,427
I don't understand, I
thought I was dead here.

289
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,129
You are, it was actually
pretty confusing.

290
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,964
So, maybe the guy with
the face full of moths

291
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,434
isn't in the best place psychologically.

292
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,569
But it gave me an idea.

293
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,899
Give The Beast what he wants...

294
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,607
Julia, from an alternate timeline
in exchange for leaving us alone.

295
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,180
And what about me?

296
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,242
Sorry, bro.

297
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,112
You're the Cedric Diggory of this story.

298
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:53,815
At least he died looking hot.

299
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:56,918
The Beast should be here soon.
He can sense magic.

300
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,953
There's no way he'd miss
that Tesla Flexion.

301
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,522
You have another choice.

302
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:02,957
In our timeline,

303
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,926
we killed The Beast using a spell...

304
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:06,260
the Rhinemann Ultra.

305
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,529
Yeah, I've heard of that.

306
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,032
Don't you need
God-level power to cast it?

307
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:27,448
Yeah, you do.

308
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,996
Also took care of your migraines,

309
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:44,098
and smoking addiction... you're welcome.

310
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,867
- How did you...
- Long story.

311
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,635
Act out.

312
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:49,437
Easy, cowboy.

313
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,472
I promise you, it's real.

314
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:55,076
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

315
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,611
So, what do you say?

316
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,116
You have this Rhinemann spell?

317
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:04,852
Dean Fogg will know where to
find it, if he's still alive.

318
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,454
Oh, he's still alive...

319
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:10,057
not exactly the premier
educator he once was.

320
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,959
Kind of a walking opioid crisis.

321
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,862
I'll, uh, take you to him.

322
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:18,212
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

323
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,768
Enjoy swapping puberty stories.

324
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,970
They're the same stories.

325
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,001
<i>So, you and Dean Fogg
are on good terms here?</i>

326
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,650
I mean, he did kick
me out of Brakebills,

327
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,631
but he's warmed to me a bit since then.

328
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,982
Nothing like watching all
of your students and friends

329
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,846
get murdered by a creature from
another world to open you up.

330
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,324
How do you know him? I thought
you didn't go to Brakebills.

331
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:41,993
It's complicated.

332
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,971
- You fucked him.
- No! What?

333
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,931
Okay, defensive much?

334
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,808
He's not that bad in bed...

335
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,235
Okay...

336
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,446
Hey, speaking of,

337
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:55,081
what's the deal with
you and me in your timeline?

338
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,137
I'm sensing some weird kinda tension.

339
00:13:57,148 --> 00:14:00,754
- Is it the fun kind?
- Like I said, we were friends.

340
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:03,895
It wasn't always fun.

341
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:05,379
We got into a big fight,

342
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,926
but we ended up kinda getting over it.

343
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,606
That's it?

344
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,543
From your face, I was expecting
something a little more...

345
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,020
dramatic.

346
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,705
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

347
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:20,873
This way?

348
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,677
Marina.

349
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:35,989
Aww, come on.

350
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,723
I won't steal anything
from you this time.

351
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,814
What did you steal from me last time?

352
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,075
Nothing, just forget I said anything.

353
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,754
Just... I found an
old student of yours, okay?

354
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:15,454
Come in.

355
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,767
Timeline 40?

356
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,566
I have to live through
another 17 more of these.

357
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:30,869
Uh, you don't remember them all?

358
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,704
Only the ones I've been through already.

359
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:35,273
I thought 22 was absolutely dreadful,

360
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,993
until this one.

361
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,414
Is that really necessary?

362
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,784
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

363
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:48,119
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

364
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,621
No, it doesn't.

365
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:52,724
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

366
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,473
Ah, yes, the Rhinemann Ultra.

367
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,673
My friend Bigby had that.

368
00:15:57,898 --> 00:15:59,731
Unfortunately, she's dead.

369
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:03,201
Everything went to shit when magic died.

370
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:05,003
Creatures got set upon,

371
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,872
chopped up to steal their mojo.

372
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:10,141
That poor thing.

373
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:15,814
I killed a leprechaun once.

374
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,899
I'm not proud.

375
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:19,620
Just saying.

376
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,354
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

377
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,024
You wouldn't happen to know
where Bigby kept it? The spell?

378
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,726
I don't.

379
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,362
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

380
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,198
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

381
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,267
but I sent two students to see her.

382
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,036
They died.

383
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,871
Seems to be a bit of a theme.

384
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,139
There's good news.

385
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:43,174
You see, their deaths were,

386
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:47,712
well, earth-shatteringly horrible.
I mean, really awful...

387
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:50,181
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

388
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,637
Wait, so how is this good news?

389
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,454
Because they're ghosts, dear.

390
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:59,090
They still haunt the library,
last I checked...

391
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:00,689
pretty deep in the stacks.

392
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,495
They might remember the spell.

393
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:07,059
But I'd be careful if I were you.

394
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,215
Ghosts, well, ghosts can be dangerous.

395
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:12,684
Yeah.

396
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,173
<i>How could you do this to me, man?</i>

397
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:18,810
You're me, I'm you, we're us.

398
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,478
I would never betray myself.

399
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,394
You haven't been through
what I've been through.

400
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,249
Yes I have, except the Lasik.

401
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,683
There's more than that.

402
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:26,918
Whatever.

403
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,387
You know, I thought you were cool

404
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:30,054
and brave.

405
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,224
And I dug your jacket, but now
I just think you're a dick,

406
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,794
which sucks,
because that means I'm a dick.

407
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,228
What do you expect?

408
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,148
My friends abandoned me.

409
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:40,913
Maybe they were right too.

410
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,691
What, did you
roofie and betray them too?

411
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:43,960
No.

412
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,746
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

413
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:47,605
How do you know what you're gonna do?

414
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,773
The Quickening?

415
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,442
What's The Quickening?

416
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,344
I can't think about it. I don'
want all their blood on my hands.

417
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,146
What the hell is The Quickening?

418
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,648
Nothing you need to worry about.

419
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,422
Just be glad you didn't bang a werewolf.

420
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,686
Let's talk about something else, okay?
Now I need an aspirin.

421
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,094
Yeah, the library got ransacked

422
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:12,530
after The Beast took out
most of the school.

423
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,866
Honestly, I did most of the ransacking,

424
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:18,002
but I didn't see any ghosts.

425
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:23,141
Eliot, holy shit!

426
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,310
Oh, what the hell was that?

427
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,780
I think I know
the students who died here.

428
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:31,349
- Eliot and...
- Margo?

429
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:37,088
I told you we need to
get our shit together, Eliot.

430
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,824
I have my shit together.

431
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:43,061
No, you're holding
your shit together, barely.

432
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:45,196
There's a difference.

433
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:48,199
Don't let that pixie twat
Bigby get in your head.

434
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,968
She called me a lush,

435
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,037
which is basically just
a nice way of saying alcoholic.

436
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,441
And she said
I couldn't handle the spell.

437
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:59,143
Why don't you prove her wrong
and help me, okay?

438
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,512
What are we doing?

439
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,215
Well, before we can do the
Rhinemann, we need a power-up.

440
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:06,217
Here is a cooperative spell.

441
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,286
Now, if we can cast this together,

442
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:10,989
it might just give us
enough juice to kill The Beast.

443
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:13,625
And if we cast it wrong,

444
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:14,792
kaboom.

445
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:17,654
So, let's not cast it wrong.

446
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:22,346
- What if Bigby was right?
- What if I am too drunk?

447
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:25,737
What if I screw it up?

448
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,185
Ack!

449
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,841
You are not gonna cock out on me.

450
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,109
Cock out?

451
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:34,946
I'd say pussy, but let's be honest.

452
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:36,548
Which one is tougher?

453
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,349
Point made.

454
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:48,526
Oh God, oh God...

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,101
I screwed up, I screwed up,
I screwed up, I screwed...

456
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:00,054
ah, ah, ah, ah...

457
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:08,880
I screwed it up, I
screwed it up, I screwed it up,

458
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:10,448
I screwed it up,

459
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,950
I screwed it up,

460
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:13,518
I screwed it up...

461
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
I screwed it up, I screwed it up...

462
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:18,623
Bambi?

463
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,225
Where's my Bambi?

464
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:25,087
Where's my Bambi?

465
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,932
- Come on... oh!
- Jesus Christ!

466
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,750
Cocks.

467
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:36,874
- Ugh, yuck, that was...
- So yuck.

468
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,176
Not fun at all.

469
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,711
Please tell me you got that spell.

470
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:43,247
Yeah, I, uh, I think I can make it out.

471
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:45,883
I think someone is following us.

472
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,589
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

473
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:53,324
Okay.

474
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,929
- Now!
- That's your signal?

475
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,034
Penny?

476
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,203
Julia.

477
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,207
So, it is you.

478
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:12,910
You're real.

479
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,912
You're alive.

480
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,759
Whoa, um, um...

481
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,661
Julia, it's me.

482
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:25,497
- Yeah, I... I know.
- God, it's like I'm...

483
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,496
- I'm living in a dream.
- Just let me short-circuit this.

484
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:30,102
If you think following two strangers

485
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,804
and then kissing one of them
is dream behavior...

486
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:34,373
She's not a stranger.

487
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,574
She's my soul mate.

488
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:37,142
Oh, God.

489
00:21:37,144 --> 00:21:38,610
Um, I'm...

490
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:42,757
I'm actually not your Julia.

491
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:47,252
You see, I'm from a different timeline.

492
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:51,046
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

493
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,325
I'm sorry, I thought-

494
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:55,027
- No, it's... it's okay.

495
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,262
When I heard a rumor that The
Beast was looking for her

496
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,664
even though she's dead, I...

497
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,599
it's crazy, but I...

498
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,539
I had to see.

499
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:05,304
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:06,471
It was stupid.

501
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:08,012
Julia, we gotta get out of here.

502
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:09,975
- Where are you going?
- To kill The Beast.

503
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:12,210
- Let me come with you.
- Okay, sorry, buddy,

504
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:14,356
but we got everything we need,
no baggage necessary.

505
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,114
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

506
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:20,437
He's a traveler, could come in handy.

507
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,355
Eye roll.

508
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:34,066
It's working, I can feel it.

509
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:41,086
It's just a lot of moving pieces.

510
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,929
So...

511
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:49,181
what's up with me in your timeline?

512
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:50,886
Well,

513
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:55,587
you're kind of in the Underworld.

514
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:57,489
Not good.

515
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,116
I'm not sure you're technically dead.

516
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:02,256
So, in the Underworld, but not dead?

517
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,686
That sounds worse.

518
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,698
Truth is,

519
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,768
you got there because
you did something heroic.

520
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,904
Unlike my alternate self, who's a dick,

521
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:16,188
possibly related to self-esteem issues,

522
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,666
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

523
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:22,277
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

524
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:25,176
Here he comes.

525
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:29,447
Hey, can I ask you one last time...

526
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,590
what is The Quickening?

527
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:32,488
No, you can't.

528
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:34,415
I don't wanna talk about
my private tragedy,

529
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:38,152
- so unless you want me to gag you...
- Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

530
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:39,520
Don't call me Dick Josh.

531
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,456
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

532
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,184
I am not a dick.
I've had harder life than you.

533
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:46,996
Did you? What makes you so sure?

534
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,897
Because you get to hang out with Julia,

535
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,265
who is awesome,

536
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,309
and I get Marina,
who is mean all the time.

537
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:56,905
Then why do you hang out with her?

538
00:23:56,907 --> 00:24:00,598
Because when she dies,
it's not going to feel so bad.

539
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:03,244
Truth is, maybe my friends abandoned me,

540
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:04,979
or maybe, I pushed them away.

541
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:07,949
Because whatever
this thing is that's looming...

542
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:11,004
because unlike me,

543
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:14,155
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

544
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,004
Don't call me Dick Josh again.

545
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:37,505
Wow.

546
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,987
Oh shit, we got company!

547
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,858
I hope you're ready.

548
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:57,432
Josh, go!

549
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,067
A Josh has to live to tell our story.

550
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:06,098
Get back! Anything inside
of 20 feet will be ash!

551
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,522
Julia.

552
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:17,618
The key didn't lie.

553
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,686
Q?

554
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:20,288
Getting a little sick of plot twists.

555
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,823
Focus, we need to get out of here.

556
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,667
I can travel, but I can't
take anyone with me

557
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:25,558
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

558
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,861
Let me try.

559
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,617
<i>Quentin is The Beast.</i>

560
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:41,289
Quentin is The Beast?

561
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,167
How the fuck is Quentin The Beast?

562
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,369
Who's Quentin again?

563
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:48,371
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

564
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:51,208
to run away to Fillory in the
first place and get murdered.

565
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,410
Yeah, by The Beast.

566
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:56,472
So, you see why this is confusing?

567
00:25:57,902 --> 00:25:59,735
Doesn't make any sense.

568
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:03,305
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

569
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:06,842
She said that he tore out his
Shade, and destroyed him.

570
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:09,578
Uh, did he look destroyed to any of you?

571
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,881
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

572
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,582
I didn't even think that was possible.

573
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:16,385
You'd have to have a lot
of power, like a God.

574
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:18,687
Oh, we are in such deep shit.

575
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:22,591
Maybe we should just stay here
in this branch of the library.

576
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:25,294
Hey Penny, where are all the Librarians?

577
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,872
I don't know.

578
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,822
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

579
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,244
It's the first place I found
where I couldn't hear The Beast.

580
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,793
Now, is that The Beast beast,

581
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:36,472
or the Q beast,
or is there another beast?

582
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:39,475
I think we're missing
some pages of the story here

583
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:41,610
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

584
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:45,214
and Quentin is The Beast,
only more powerful.

585
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:47,416
I know who we should talk to...

586
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:49,752
the one person who tried
to bring Quentin back.

587
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:53,789
do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

588
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:59,662
Um...

589
00:26:59,664 --> 00:27:02,331
is there an Alice Quinn on this boat?

590
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,614
Other cabin.

591
00:27:04,936 --> 00:27:06,364
Thanks.

592
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,840
I was going to give up on Quentin.

593
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,242
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

594
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:14,543
and I couldn't reach it

595
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:17,379
until your Tesla Flexion came through.

596
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:19,748
That changed everything.

597
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,255
Seeing him and hearing
that he loved me...

598
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:28,215
just knowing that he was out there,
if only I could bring him back.

599
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,825
So, what did you do?

600
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:31,727
There's a creature in the Northern Marsh

601
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:35,397
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

602
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,635
What kind of evil creature-type
deal are we talking here?

603
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:43,205
When I die,
I won't go to the Underworld.

604
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:45,474
Now, I belong to him.

605
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:47,755
So, Harvey Weinstein-type evil.

606
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:51,080
So, um, what did he give you?

607
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:54,383
The power to bring
Quentin back without his Shade.

608
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:57,119
I was so heartbroken, I thought
that maybe we could just

609
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:59,685
fix it together once he returned.

610
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,997
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

611
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:06,428
Without his Shade, he...

612
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,598
- He wasn't Quentin.
- No.

613
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:14,270
He wanted Fillory for himself.

614
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,005
So, he killed The Beast.

615
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:18,107
But that wasn't enough.

616
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,976
So, he found a way to kill
Ember, and steal his powers.

617
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:23,379
But because he killed a God...

618
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:26,015
The Old Gods took magic away.

619
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:29,364
Quentin still had the power
he stole from Ember.

620
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:34,450
He told me that Fillory was the
only thing that he truly loved.

621
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:37,559
It was always his escape.

622
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:39,763
He was afraid of magic,

623
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,256
of any Magician who might bring it back.

624
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:45,482
Anyone who would oppose him,

625
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,864
take Fillory from him...

626
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:51,874
And the six fingers, moths...

627
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,375
how'd that shit happen?

628
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:54,857
I don't know.

629
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:59,315
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

630
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:03,886
that he was the only one who
appreciated Fillory like he did.

631
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,688
I'm sorry.

632
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,258
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I just... I loved Quentin.

633
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,961
And I wanted to see him again.

634
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:13,796
It's okay.

635
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:16,465
Hell no, it's not okay.

636
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:18,934
All of our friends died because of you,

637
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:21,044
because of what you did.

638
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,139
Because of what I did.

639
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,442
Quentin and I used the Tesla Flexion

640
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:29,011
to talk to her.

641
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,647
And if we hadn't,
Alice never would've tried

642
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,082
to bring her Quentin back,

643
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,850
and none of this would've happened.

644
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:37,686
Whoa, whoa, time travel headache.

645
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,989
Okay, so, what, just
because you gave her the sads,

646
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,458
it's somehow your fault that
she resurrected a crazy monster

647
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:45,302
who murdered everybody and got
magic turned off? I mean, yeah,

648
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:47,161
I guess it's kind of
a little bit your fault,

649
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,549
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

650
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,101
So, why you on this ship anyway?

651
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,450
What is with all the bunnies?

652
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:55,885
Are you trying to send a
bunch of messages or something?

653
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,073
No, I work for them.

654
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:00,943
They're radish smugglers, I...

655
00:30:00,945 --> 00:30:04,146
I stack boxes. It's the
only thing they can't do.

656
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,384
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

657
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:10,686
so I can try to fix my mistake.

658
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,787
How?

659
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:14,456
By finding a weapon to kill Quentin.

660
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,638
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

661
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:26,268
I found this.

662
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:33,042
Don't ask me how.

663
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:40,682
Let me guess... you traveled to the past

664
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:42,518
and made a deal with a knife maker?

665
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:48,924
The only problem is,

666
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,360
I don't have enough power to touch it.

667
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:03,087
I do.

668
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,209
I'll tell Captain Hopps I'm leaving.

669
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:23,725
Found some carrot wine.

670
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,463
The other Josh

671
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:31,166
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

672
00:31:31,168 --> 00:31:33,936
Something did... he fucking died.

673
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:36,738
Yeah, but...

674
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,440
It's gonna happen to me too.

675
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:41,210
Whatever the holy hell
was gonna happen to him

676
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:44,113
that he never goddamn told me
because I never got past the part,

677
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,949
it's called The Quickening,

678
00:31:46,951 --> 00:31:48,928
'cause that's not ominous.

679
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,422
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

680
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:55,724
That's what I always heard too.

681
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:59,895
Turns out, it's murder herpes.

682
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:02,631
So, yay.

683
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:06,902
If I find out I may turn into
a monster and kill everyone,

684
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:09,153
I'd run far away.

685
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:14,176
'Cause if you're near Julia
when that happens,

686
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:16,560
I'll kill you myself, Dick Josh.

687
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,358
- We can't do that.
- But it totally works.

688
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,193
We pop in, we throw Alice to The Beast,

689
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:32,761
and when he's munching on her entrails,

690
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:35,397
Penny pops you behind and
you stab Q-bert in the back.

691
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,633
Marina, I'm not going
to use Alice as bait.

692
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:40,669
Why not? I mean, you heard her.
This is all her fault,

693
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:43,338
she wants to fix what she screwed up.

694
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,875
There are ways to do this without
sacrificing her life, okay?

695
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:49,938
Are you getting cold feet because The
Beast is your former best friend,

696
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:52,347
the unimpressive white guy?

697
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:53,949
No, it's not that.

698
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:56,055
Because people have already
died in this timeline.

699
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,500
Basically, everyone I know...

700
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:01,323
they're dead because of short,
blonde, and crazy, and I guess you.

701
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:04,793
But why would you give a shit about
that? You just want your stupid key.

702
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:16,138
I tried to kill a God once
with help from a friend...

703
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,675
you.

704
00:33:19,472 --> 00:33:21,944
I used you as bait to lure him.

705
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:25,621
And when I couldn't get back
in time, he killed you.

706
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:29,878
I screwed up, and you died.

707
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,689
And it was horrible.

708
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:34,957
Jesus Christ.

709
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:36,358
I'm so sorry.

710
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:39,191
I couldn't tell you before because

711
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:41,831
it was my fault.

712
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:46,508
And I can never do that
to someone again.

713
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:51,807
So, what do you wanna do?
I mean, this shit is dangerous.

714
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:55,244
We can't just waltz up on The Beast.

715
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:57,555
He may act like a beast, but,

716
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:02,001
deep down, he's the Quentin
I've always known.

717
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:06,879
So, what are you saying?
You wanna spare him?

718
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:11,893
I wanna use that against him.

719
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,704
Uh, wow.

720
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:28,984
He really let the place go.

721
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,786
What is all this shit?

722
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:37,567
The Winter's Doe...

723
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,079
what's left of her.

724
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,621
Jesus, did he eat her?

725
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:47,146
These are the polished rocks
from the Silver Banks.

726
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:50,348
That's where Martin Chatwin
learned to skip rocks.

727
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:55,521
This is a bugle from Brass City.

728
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,774
Rupert learned to play on this.

729
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:00,560
- You guys, this isn't trash.
- No.

730
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:06,232
This is a "Fillory and
Further" fan boy's collection.

731
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:07,867
It's trash.

732
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:10,236
Quentin's been hoarding this.

733
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,286
You're not a very good player,

734
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:31,572
whoever you are.

735
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:39,526
Hilarious.

736
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,441
Alice?

737
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:51,377
I can smell you.

738
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,112
Why don't you come on out?

739
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:54,480
He knows I'm here.

740
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:56,351
Hurry, quick, let's go.

741
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,483
I'm trying.

742
00:35:57,485 --> 00:36:02,151
Shit, he must've cast a ward. I
can't travel into the throne room.

743
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:06,492
Fine, you don't wanna come out?

744
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:08,961
Then I will...

745
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:10,997
fill the room with fire.

746
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,444
You guys stay, I'll go.

747
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,536
- No, Alice, don't.
- I have to.

748
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:22,341
If I don't, he'll kill all of us.

749
00:36:27,048 --> 00:36:29,109
I'm here, Quentin.

750
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:34,253
Wait.

751
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,289
I am the only one who can stop him.

752
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,700
I made a mistake.

753
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,137
- I should never have run from you.
- That's what I said.

754
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:54,473
You killed every
Magician you could find,

755
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,683
except me.

756
00:36:58,308 --> 00:36:59,912
Why?

757
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,739
I thought about it, but you were doing

758
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,550
such a good job of torturing yourself.

759
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:07,281
And the others, I...

760
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:12,301
I could say that they were a threat,
but honestly, I just realized

761
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:14,718
that I didn't like them very much.

762
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:17,640
Doesn't sound like you.

763
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:20,606
I know you.

764
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,517
You knew me.

765
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:26,120
You're not Martin Chatwin, you're
not The Beast... you hate The Beast.

766
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:27,593
True.

767
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:32,484
But you show up with a face full of
moths, and everyone loses their shit.

768
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:39,140
People think that The Beast

769
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:42,874
is invincible.

770
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:49,312
Who wouldn't use that
to their advantage?

771
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:53,952
I think that he would be flattered

772
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:57,929
I did a Dread Pirate Roberts.

773
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:00,983
"The Princess Bride."

774
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:03,828
Please, Quentin.

775
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:07,165
I know the man that I love
is still inside you somewhere.

776
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,242
Yeah, I ate him.

777
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,703
Okay, this is obviously

778
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:14,406
a ploy to buy your friends time,

779
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:17,000
so why don't we just get this over with?

780
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:26,751
That's a familiar scent.

781
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,757
Julia.

782
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,128
You can't kill me, you've already tried.

783
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:48,373
What did you...

784
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,608
what did you do to me?

785
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,309
It's my Shade.

786
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:53,211
And I can live without it if I have to.

787
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:56,846
Everything that you are
feeling right now,

788
00:38:56,857 --> 00:39:00,085
I have felt...
grief, sadness, shame, regret.

789
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,453
Q?

790
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,558
Alice.

791
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:13,064
I killed her.

792
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,778
I'm so sorry.

793
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:20,372
Q?

794
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,193
Where did you find the key?

795
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:27,982
Um...

796
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:30,649
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

797
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:34,886
and I couldn't have that,
so I got it first.

798
00:39:34,888 --> 00:39:38,323
I know why you were looking for me.
The key...

799
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:41,359
it showed you visions of the future...

800
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:43,395
me killing you.

801
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,130
Julia...

802
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,165
I'm here to tell you I'm not.

803
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,653
I'm not going to kill you.

804
00:39:50,437 --> 00:39:52,804
I wanna help you.

805
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:56,005
The visions weren't of you killing me.

806
00:39:56,649 --> 00:40:00,050
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

807
00:40:01,682 --> 00:40:05,884
You were trying to let magic in, but
you let in something much worse.

808
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:07,452
What?

809
00:40:07,454 --> 00:40:09,387
A monster.

810
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:14,763
One even worse than me.

811
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:17,328
You should take your Shade back.

812
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,933
You look dumb.

813
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:59,003
I'm trying to get this
stupid key to open up a door.

814
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:02,595
Well, isn't there, like, some
kind of ritual for that? Or...

815
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:03,875
It would be nice

816
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:08,652
if there was, but no, so, key-waving.

817
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:11,207
Is that my Josh's jacket?

818
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,350
Yeah.

819
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:15,684
Hm, you look cooler.

820
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:17,422
You are mean.

821
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:27,165
So, the key show you anything?

822
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,968
Visions of the future?

823
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,102
Nothing.

824
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:32,737
Okay.

825
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:35,940
Then I guess you don't know
that I'm coming with you.

826
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:36,985
What?

827
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,277
Your Penny's dead, or,

828
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:42,447
not alive in some confusing way.

829
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,707
- Penny, I don't...
- I'm not asking permission.

830
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:48,223
Okay.

831
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,966
I'm not her.

832
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,317
I know that.

833
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:56,772
It's just, there's nothing here for me.

834
00:41:56,774 --> 00:41:57,957
But there?

835
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,609
Give it time.

836
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,285
Hey, uh, Jules?

837
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:05,762
We have a door.

838
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:12,587
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

839
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:14,398
I honestly don't know.
