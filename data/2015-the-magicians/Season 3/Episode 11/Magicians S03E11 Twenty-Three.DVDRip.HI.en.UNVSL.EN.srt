00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,441
ELIOT: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,530
No more magic means
no more idiotic Earth rulers,

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,265
and I get my kingdom back.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,604
We are gonna hunt down

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,974
every last living slaver,

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,037
<i>and hang them by
their own entrails.</i>

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,278
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,877
Ember gave her the
ability to create a time loop.

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:20,953
A time loop.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,614
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,180
How many times have I died?

12
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,659
Thirty-nine... the Alice
from the 23rd timeline

13
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,094
was the sole
survivor of The Beast.

14
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,188
We need to talk to her.
DEAN: Well, you can't.

15
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,961
JULIA: <i>Well, what
about a Tesla Flexion?</i>

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,434
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

17
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,266
I thought I'd never
see you again.

18
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,135
The Beast, he...
He tore you apart,

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,175
piece by piece, but
not just your body,

20
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,142
but your... Your
Shade, everything.

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,078
(HOWLS) I have
sexually-transmitted lycanthropy.

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,512
It's totally curable.

23
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,608
There is no actual
cure. A silver bullet.

24
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,380
These are my students,
they are in need

25
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,818
of the Rhinemann Ultra. (LAUGHS)

26
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,823
BIGBY: <i>No one but you can
be within 20 feet of the blast...</i>

27
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,157
<i>It will kill anyone
including your Beast.</i>

28
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,251
(GRUNTS)

29
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,740
So, you wanna tell me where
you hooked up with your partner?

30
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:04,788
Fillory.

31
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,857
If he smells you
again, he won't show.

32
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,368
If you want him,

33
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,461
<i>you might just have
to risk losing your base.</i>

34
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,167
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

35
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,368
Yes.

36
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,086
We have one of the
keys in the Fairy Realm.

37
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,170
Without the key,
everything collapses,

38
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,238
which is why we can
never give it to you.

39
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,283
ELIOT: I don't know what they
think is going on with my nose.

40
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,944
Yeah, and those
are not my teeth.

41
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,047
And only 1,000 Fillorian
Gold Crescents for us?

42
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,115
Tick is cheap. It'll
be his downfall.

43
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,058
I'll kill him. Who
you gonna kill?

44
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,493
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

45
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,690
Your incursion
into the throne room

46
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,528
put that cheapskate
on red alert.

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,068
Wait, we're on there too?

48
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,693
You're kings and
queens of Fillory,

49
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,203
so you're a threat to his reign.

50
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,330
Yeah, well, so was Josh.

51
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,703
I don't see his face on there.

52
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,709
He was more like a
substitute teacher, didn't count.

53
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,802
We got news. Uh,
Julia sent a bunny.

54
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,575
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

55
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,311
Fucking what?

56
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,381
ELIOT: Hold on, so, on Earth,

57
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,217
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is...

58
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,415
A good guy, kind of?

59
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,587
Uh-uh. You know what?

60
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,455
Fuck Tinkerbitch. Fuck her
right in the Egg McMuffin.

61
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,826
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

62
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,958
Unfortunately, she's
as helpful as pubic lice.

63
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,229
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

64
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,447
and I think we
should do it in person.

65
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,372
Sorry, but we're all wanted,

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,409
and Tick's just stepped up the
patrols around the portal tree.

67
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,686
Well, why don't we
just send one of us?

68
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,887
It'll be easier to
break through.

69
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,436
I'll do it. You can't.

70
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,243
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

71
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,080
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

72
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,347
It doesn't taste like
horse... (CHUCKLES)

73
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,718
What?

74
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,421
DEAN: Jesus, fuck.

75
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,357
I'm... (SCOFFS)

76
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,963
I'm much too sober for all this.

77
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,763
Yeah, well, you have to hear it.

78
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,234
A lot of the
McAllisters are dead,

79
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,497
but Irene is still out there,

80
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,130
and I don't know
what she's going to do.

81
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,505
Slavery, mass murder...

82
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,341
And yet, it smells
so floral in here.

83
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,579
Lucier's cleaning charm.

84
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,882
Next time, try less rosewater.

85
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,150
Any idea about how
to deal with Irene,

86
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,279
who will doubtless
want her property back?

87
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,487
Well, she'll have
to find it first.

88
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,823
Did you poke out her eyes?

89
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,191
No.

90
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,164
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

91
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,290
You did what? By yourself?

92
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,664
That's impossible.

93
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,430
That's apparently
what I can do now.

94
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,834
My magic's been growing,

95
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,840
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

96
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,102
(CHUCKLES)

97
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,337
This is new territory for me.

98
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,844
Me too.

99
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,711
Well, look, the school's
yours again, if you want it.

100
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,710
Sober up.

101
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,915
'Sup.

102
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,049
So, the Fairy Queen
can't give us the Sixth Key.

103
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,418
The Fairy Realm
will collapse without it.

104
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,187
Well, that blows.

105
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,834
Honestly, my instructions
ended at talk to Julia.

106
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,201
So what are we
supposed to do now?

107
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,368
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING) Uh...

108
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,240
How did we end
up at Burning Man?

109
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,275
We're inside a Tesla Flexion.

110
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,508
Is that a car?

111
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,822
A device that allows you to
communicate across timelines.

112
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,983
Like, alternate
universes-type shit?

113
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,520
Like alternate
universes-type shit.

114
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,525
Don't touch anything. Copy that.

115
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,993
Usual paradox/explosion
problems?

116
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,757
Someone cast
this to pull us inside.

117
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,297
We just need to find out who.

118
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,923
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

119
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,926
Thank God, it worked.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

121
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,383
Holy mirror universes, Batman.

122
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,783
It's me.

123
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,219
Like, you're me...

124
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,361
Okay, calm your shit. I'm
from a different timeline.

125
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,001
You're in a Tesla
Flexion, we only have...

126
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,391
Two minutes. We know the rules.

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,621
Right. Of course.

128
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,356
You pulled Alice into
one of these before.

129
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,022
Wait, you're from
that same timeline?

130
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,475
That's right. Look,
we need your help.

131
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,331
There's this monster
here killing Magicians.

132
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,401
We call him The Beast.

133
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,597
12 fingers? Cloud of
moths around his face?

134
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,866
Yeah, I tried to get people

135
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,532
to call him
Mothra... Didn't stick.

136
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,075
Here either, can't
expect everyone

137
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,906
to be down with
the Kaiju classics.

138
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,639
Okay, guys, two minutes, right?

139
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,806
Right, uh, problem
is, magic vanished.

140
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,559
These plumber guys
showed up one day and just...

141
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,812
Shut it off like a faucet.

142
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,545
Here, too.

143
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,247
But you guys have no idea why?

144
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,880
No clue, except the problem is,

145
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,982
we lost magic, but
The Beast didn't.

146
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,424
He was suddenly unstoppable.

147
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,624
(STAMMERS) I don't understand.

148
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,822
So magic is gone,

149
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,092
but then how does
he still have it?

150
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,793
Dude, I don't know.

151
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,678
Maybe it has something to do
with this key around his neck.

152
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,136
Wait, what key?

153
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,638
Uh, about yea big.

154
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,606
Rumor is, it gives him
visions of the future.

155
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,905
Visions of the future...
None of our keys do that.

156
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,808
Look, Julia, in my timeline,

157
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,904
you were the best
student Brakebills ever had

158
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,380
until you were
horribly murdered.

159
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,916
Oh. But with your help,

160
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,918
we might stand a
chance against Mothra.

161
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,477
And Josh, well, you're me.

162
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,420
No argument there. (WATCH BEEPS)

163
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,548
Shit, uh, please...

164
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,835
You have to find
a way back here.

165
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,136
This is our most desperate hour.

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,287
Help us, Julia and Josh.

167
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,659
You're our only hope.

Ended on a <i>Star Wars</i> reference?

171
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,682
He really knew how to get to me.

172
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,969
We're his new hope.

173
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,202
All I'm saying is, can
we even trust him?

174
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,676
Of course we can trust him.

175
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,939
It's me.

176
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,947
I would know if I was lying.

177
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,482
You said we can't
get the Sixth Key,

178
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,744
and visions of the future?

179
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,513
That has to be the seventh.

180
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,053
Any reason we
gotta do this in order?

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,418
I don't know.

182
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,480
Up until now, the book
told us where to go,

183
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,788
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

184
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,139
about where to
find the next one.

185
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,129
Well, maybe this
time, we flip it.

186
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,188
The key quest
has been Q's thing.

187
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,234
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

188
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,860
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

189
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,881
and see what he and the
others have to say about it.

190
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,602
Fine, but I will freely
admit I was getting excited

191
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,143
at the idea of a
Josh-Julia solo adventure.

192
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,508
Sorry.

193
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,604
Yeah, what would the
shippers even call us?

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,548
Josh? Julia? See?

195
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,227
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

196
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,549
Nope.

197
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,128
Where's the portal?

198
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,953
What happened?

199
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,596
The Time Key sent us to the lab.

200
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,400
Not our lab.

201
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,800
This place is a wreck.

202
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,271
Damn, that was fast.

203
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,766
We're in Timeline 23.

204
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,902
Act out.

205
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,581
This doesn't make sense.

206
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,549
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

207
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,711
It just decided to
send us back here?

208
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,118
What even are the rules?

209
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,211
Beats me...

210
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,847
They're weirdly
inconsistent. Uh-huh.

211
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,859
I guess we have some shit
to take care of in Timeline 23,

212
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,588
maybe key-related.

213
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,493
It worked! They're here!

214
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,495
Marina?

215
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,093
Holy shit.

216
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,934
Wait, you know her?

217
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,440
Of course I do, she
was a year ahead of me,

218
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,975
and hot, um... (LAUGHS)

219
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,978
Okay, I know you by reputation,

220
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,241
but how do you know me?

221
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,942
I don't know you here?

222
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,211
No.

223
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,946
You went to Brakebills,

224
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,988
I'm a hedge witch, we don't mix.

225
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,114
So, what happened
in your timeline?

226
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,956
Um... I didn't go to Brakebills,

227
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,623
so we became friends.

228
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,993
Friends?

229
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,856
That does not sound like me.

230
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,696
Wait, you didn't
go to Brakebills?

231
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,566
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

232
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,332
Alternate timeline
shit is weird.

233
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,498
Tell me about it.

234
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,905
Why don't we go somewhere safer?

235
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,374
We can talk about all this.

236
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,875
JOSH: Jesus, place hasn't looked

237
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,812
this partied out
since my first year.

238
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,408
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

239
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,345
No clue, how about in yours?

240
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,614
(SIGHS)

241
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,485
A god was killed by a human.

242
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,182
The old gods took it
away as punishment.

243
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,453
Bunch of Mount
Olympus-sized dicks.

244
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,121
And magic going out here was
the beginning of the end for us.

245
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,720
That Beast started
killing Magicians...

246
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,891
First Brakebills, then
the hedge witches.

247
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,832
So, we joined forces to survive.

248
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,304
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

249
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,966
is Brakebills really the safest
place for us to hang out?

250
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,010
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

251
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,510
Thinks everyone's dead.

252
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,671
We have scoured
what's left of the place

253
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,181
looking for a way to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

254
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,945
That's how we found
the Tesla Flexion,

255
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,485
and a battery to cast it.

256
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,020
And this sweet jacket.

257
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,454
It's not magic, but
might as well be.

258
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,458
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

259
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,525
Julia can... (CLEARS THROAT)

260
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,996
Uh, tell you about it herself.

261
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,034
And it's not even...
It's not even big news.

262
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,591
I don't know why I said that...

263
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,030
Your Beast has some sort of key?

264
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,633
Mmm-hmm.

265
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,299
We need it.

266
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,573
You help us kill our Beast,

267
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,570
key is yours.

268
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,338
Deal.

269
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,540
Boom.

270
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,173
Let's celebrate, bitches...

271
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,913
Powerful women.

272
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,255
So, Marina, huh?

273
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,017
You know, I've always
had a crush on her.

274
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,183
I know.

275
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,316
Oh.

276
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,792
Right... (LAUGHS)

277
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,471
Hey, what happened
to the glasses?

278
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,554
Lasik.

279
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,126
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

280
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,294
You are the braver Josh.

281
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,194
I've been through some shit.

282
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,329
Tell.

283
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,832
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

284
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,069
I ended up stuck...

285
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,044
Stuck in the
Neitherlands, me too.

286
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,322
If the Physical Kids
hadn't shown up,

287
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,507
I don't know how long...

288
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,981
No one ever showed up for me.

289
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,912
No one made it out?

290
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,280
Some made it out, they
just forgot about me.

291
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,945
Dude.

292
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,982
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

293
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,154
I'd be a lone wolf...
Brave, heroic, solo.

294
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,923
Got Lasik, found
this sweet jacket,

295
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,363
and changed my fucking life.

296
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,525
Wow.

297
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,344
Is this like that time
when we got that

298
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,631
Kangol hat in middle school

299
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,314
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

300
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,170
No, it's not like that at all.

301
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,635
Cool.

302
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,307
Inspiring.

303
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,469
And, uh...

304
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,939
(EXHALES) Whew.

305
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,174
Did you...

306
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,542
Did you just roofie me?

307
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,915
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

308
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,513
(GROANS)

309
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,284
Nighty-night.

310
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,823
(GROANING)

311
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,632
What happened?

312
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,398
JULIA: What the hell
are we tied up with?

313
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,834
It was Professor Sunderland's.

314
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,667
Wish I took more
classes with her.

315
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,803
Why are we all tied up?

316
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,633
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

317
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,200
until now.

318
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,678
We're gonna give you to him.

319
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,309
This is insane.

320
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,349
You can't trust The Beast.

321
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,923
What makes you think he'll
make a deal instead of killing you?

322
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,283
You.

323
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,619
When he showed up here
with his key killing everybody,

324
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,124
he kept asking for you.

325
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,792
I don't understand, I
thought I was dead here.

326
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,592
You are, it was
actually pretty confusing.

327
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,496
So, maybe the guy
with the face full of moths

328
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,398
isn't in the best
place psychologically.

329
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,469
But it gave me an idea.

330
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,095
Give The Beast what he wants...

331
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,867
Julia, from an
alternate timeline

332
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,670
in exchange for
leaving us alone.

333
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,171
And what about me?

334
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,537
Sorry, bro.

335
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,341
You're the Cedric
Diggory of this story.

336
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,473
At least he died looking hot.

337
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,183
The Beast should be here soon.

338
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,878
He can sense magic.

339
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,020
There's no way he'd
miss that Tesla Flexion.

340
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,955
You have another choice.

341
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,119
In our timeline,

342
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,285
we killed The
Beast using a spell...

343
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,623
The Rhinemann Ultra.

344
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,857
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
I've heard of that.

345
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,190
Don't you need
god-level power to cast it?

346
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,866

347
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,069

348
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,079
Yeah, you do.

352

and smoking addiction...
You're welcome.

353
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,991
How did you... Long story.

354
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,759
Act out.

355
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:50,995
Easy, cowboy.

356
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,640
I promise you, it's real.

357
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,535
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

358
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,267
So, what do you say?

359
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,442
You have this Rhinemann spell?

360
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,084
Dean Fogg will know where
to find it, if he's still alive.

361
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,618
Oh, he's still alive...

362
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,254
Not exactly the premier
educator he once was.

363
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,226
Kind of a walking opioid crisis.

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,586
I'll take you to him.

365
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,126
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

366
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,969
Enjoy swapping puberty stories.

367
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,265
They're the same stories.

JULIA: So, you and Dean
Fogg are on good terms here?

370
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,156
I mean, he did kick
me out of Brakebills,

371
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,149
but he's warmed to
me a bit since then.

372
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,327
Nothing like watching all
of your students and friends

from another world to open you up.

374
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,341
How do you know him? I
thought you didn't go to Brakebills.

375
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,990
It's complicated.

376
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,960
You fucked him. No! What?

377
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,823
Okay, defensive much?

378
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,644
He's not that bad in
bed... (CHUCKLES)

379
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,860
Okay...

380
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,562
Hey, speaking of,

381
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,867
what's the deal with you
and me in your timeline?

382
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,136
I'm sensing some
weird kinda tension.

383
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,231
Is it the fun kind?

384
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,334
Like I said, we were friends.

385
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,707
It wasn't always fun.

386
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,271
We got into a big fight,

387
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,547
uh, but we ended up
kinda getting over it.

388
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
That's it?

389
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,716
From your face, I was expecting
something a little more...

390
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,090
Dramatic.

391
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,353
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

392
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,688
This way?

Oh, come on.

396
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,739
I won't steal anything
from you this time.

397
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,014
What did you steal
from me last time?

398
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,524
Nothing, just forget
I said anything.

399
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,521

403
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,464
I have to live through
another 17 more of these.

404
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,196
Uh, you don't remember them all?

405
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,998
Only the ones I've
been through already.

406
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,334
I thought 22 was
absolutely dreadful,

407
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,971
until this one.

408
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,504
Is that really necessary?

409
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,072
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

410
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,243
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

411
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,718
No, it doesn't.

412
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,984
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

413
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,591
Ah, yes, the Rhinemann Ultra.

414
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,351
My friend Bigby had that.

415
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,494
Unfortunately, she's dead.

416
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,928
Everything went to
shit when magic died.

Creatures got set upon,

418
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,033
chopped up to steal their mojo.

419
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,299
That poor thing.

420
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,734
I killed a leprechaun once.

421
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,478
I'm not proud.

422
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,849
Just saying.

423
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,485
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

424
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,119
You wouldn't happen to
know where Bigby kept it?

425
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,212
The spell?

426
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,621
I don't.

427
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,753
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

428
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,319
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

429
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,389
but I sent two
students to see her.

430
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,234
(SNIFFS) They died.

431
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,031
Seems to be a bit of a theme.

There's good news.

433
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,339
You see, their deaths were,

434
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,875
well, earth-shatteringly
horrible.

435
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,070
I mean, really
awful... (CHUCKLES)

436
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,409
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

437
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,416
Wait, so how is this good news?

438
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,717
Because they're ghosts, dear.

439
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,322
They still haunt the
Library, last I checked...

440
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,652
Pretty deep in the stacks.

441
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,854
They might remember the spell.

442
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,121
But I'd be careful
if I were you.

443
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,034
Ghosts, well, ghosts
can be dangerous.

444
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,501
Yeah.

445
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,434
JOSH: How could
you do this to me, man?

446
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,136
You're me, I'm you, we're us.

447
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,734
I would never betray myself.

448
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,388
You haven't been through
what I've been through.

449
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,438
Yes, I have, except the Lasik.

450
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,876
There's more than that.

451
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,149
Whatever.

452
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,776
You know, I thought
you were cool

453
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,286
and brave.

454
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,548
And I dug your jacket,

455
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,487
but now I just
think you're a dick,

456
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,526
which sucks, because
that means I'm a dick.

457
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,454
What do you expect?

458
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,893
My friends abandoned me.

459
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,161
Maybe they were right too.

460
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,960
What, did you roofie
and betray them too?

461
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,194
No.

462
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,912
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

463
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,598
How do you know
what you're gonna do?

464
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,930
The Quickening?

465
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,473
What's the Quickening?

466
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,235
I can't think about it.

467
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,619
I don't want all their
blood on my hands.

468
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,373
What the hell is the Quickening?

469
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,879
Nothing you need to worry about.

Just be glad you
didn't bang a werewolf.

something else, okay?

Now I need an aspirin.

473
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,389
Yeah, the Library got ransacked

474
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,827
after The Beast took
out most of the school.

475
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,161
Honestly, I did most
of the ransacking,

476
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,291
but I didn't see any ghosts.

Don't let that pixie twat
Bigby get in your head.

487
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,464
She called me a lush,

488
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,526
which is basically just a
nice way of saying alcoholic.

490
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,865
And she said I couldn't
handle the spell.

Why don't you prove her
wrong and help me, okay?

492

What are we doing?

493
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,703
Well, before we can
do the Rhinemann,

494
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,179
we need a power-up.

495

Here is a cooperative spell.

496

Now, if we can
cast this together,

497
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,253
it might just give us enough
juice to kill The Beast.

498
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,352
And if we cast it wrong,

499

500
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,793

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,741
Yeah, I think I can make it out.

535
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,239
(WHISPERING) I think
someone is following us.

536
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,987
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

537
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,122
Okay.

538
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,983
Now!

539
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,255
That's your signal?

540
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,430
Penny?

541
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,829
Julia.

542
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,102
So, it is you.

543
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,635
You're real.

544
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,809
You're alive.

545
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,776
Whoa! Um, uh...

546
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,582
Julia, it's me.

547
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,678
Yeah, I know.

548
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,814
God, it's like I'm...

549
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,719
I'm living in a dream.

550
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,351
Just let me short-circuit this.

551
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,019
If you think following
two strangers

552
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,792
and then kissing one of
them is dream behavior...

553
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,264
She's not a stranger.

554
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,493
She's my soul mate.

555
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,830
Oh, God.

556
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,535
(STUTTERS) I'm...

557
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,040
I'm actually not your Julia.

558
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,871
You see, I'm from
a different timeline.

559
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,176
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

560
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,351
I'm sorry, I thought...

561
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,750
No, it's... It's okay.

562
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,051
When I heard a rumor that
The Beast was looking for her

563
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,715
even though she's dead, I...

564
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,122
It's crazy, but I...

565
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,957
I had to see.

566
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,086
I'm sorry.

567
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,461
It was stupid.

568
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,897
Julia, we gotta get out of here.

569
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,094
Where are you going?
To kill The Beast.

570
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,399
Let me come with
you. Okay, sorry, buddy,

571
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,182
but we got everything we
need, no baggage necessary.

572
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,970
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

573
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,440
He's a Traveler,
could come in handy.

574
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,341
Eye roll.

575
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,653
It's working, I can feel it.

576
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,227
(SIGHS)

577
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,255
It's just a lot of
moving pieces.

578
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,199
PENNY 23: So...

579
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,797
What's up with me
in your timeline?

580
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,267
Well,

581
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,502
you're kind of in
the Underworld.

582
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,045
Not good.

583
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,709
I'm not sure you're
technically dead.

584
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,278
So, in the Underworld,
but not dead?

585
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,414
That sounds worse.

586
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,090
Truth is,

587
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,385
you got there because
you did something heroic.

588
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:19,059
Unlike my alternate
self, who's a dick,

589
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,760
possibly related to
self-esteem issues,

590
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,429
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

591
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,598
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

592
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,769
Here he comes.

593
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,011
Hey, can I ask
you one last time...

594
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,309
What is the Quickening?

595
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,078
No, you can't.

596
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,982
I don't wanna talk
about my private tragedy,

597
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,229
so unless you want
me to gag you...

598
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,779
Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

599
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,222
Don't call me Dick Josh.

600
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,987
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

601
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,918
I am not a dick. I've had
a harder life than you.

602
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,055
Did you? What makes you so sure?

603
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,464
(SCOFFS) Because you
get to hang out with Julia,

604
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,831
who is awesome,

605
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,928
and I get Marina, who
is mean all the time.

606
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,095
(CHUCKLES)

607
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,635
Then why do you
hang out with her?

608
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,876
Because when she dies,
it's not going to feel so bad.

609
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,880
Truth is, maybe my
friends abandoned me,

610
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,883
or maybe, I pushed them away.

611
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,181
Because whatever this
thing is that's looming...

612
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,721
Because unlike me,

613
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,852
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

614
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,984
(SCOFFS)

615
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,271
Don't call me Dick Josh again.

616
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,333
(CHUCKLES)

617
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,281
Wow.

618
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,981
(MOTHS FLUTTERING)

619
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,620
Oh, shit, we got company!

620
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
I hope you're ready.

621
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,928
(CHOKING)

622
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,927
Josh, go!

623
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,763
A Josh has to live
to tell our story.

624
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,801
Get back! Anything
inside of 20 feet will be ash!

625
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,845
Julia.

626
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,946
The key didn't lie.

627
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,489
Q?

628
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,081
Getting a little
sick of plot twists.

629
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,569
MARINA 23: Focus, we
need to get out of here.

630
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,528
I can travel, but I can't
take anyone with me

631
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,172
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

632
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,255
JULIA: Let me try.

633
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,071
Quentin is The Beast.
Quentin is The Beast?

634
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,140
How the fuck is
Quentin The Beast?

635
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,509
Who's Quentin again?

636
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,121
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

637
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,699
to run away to
Fillory in the first place

638
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,952
and get murdered.

639
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,152
Yeah, by The Beast.

640
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,760
So, you see why
this is confusing?

641
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,165
Doesn't make any sense.

642
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,760
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

643
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,835
She said that he
tore out his Shade,

644
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,305
and destroyed him.

645
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,205
Uh, did he look
destroyed to any of you?

646
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,711
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

647
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,303
I didn't even think
that was possible.

648
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,871
You'd have to
have a lot of power,

649
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,211
like a god.

650
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,548
Oh, we are in such deep shit.

651
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,850
Maybe we should just stay
here in this branch of The Library.

652
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,955
Hey, Penny, where
are all the Librarians?

653
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,318
I don't know.

654
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,571
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

655
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,996
It's the first place I found
where I couldn't hear The Beast.

656
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,430
Now, is that The Beast beast,

657
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:44,129
or the Q Beast, or is
there another Beast?

658
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,139
I think we're missing some
pages of the story here

659
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,232
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

660
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,836
and Quentin is The
Beast, only more powerful.

661
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,641
I know who we should talk to...

662
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,481
The one person who
tried to bring Quentin back.

663
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,818
Do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

664
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,422
JULIA: Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

665
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,058
Is there an Alice
Quinn on this boat?

666
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,495
Other cabin.

667
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,796
Thanks.

668
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,466
ALICE 23: I was going
to give up on Quentin.

669
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,932
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

670
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,235
and I couldn't reach it

671
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,367
until your Tesla
Flexion came through.

672
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,003
That changed everything.

673
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,540
Seeing him and
hearing that he loved me,

674
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,086
just knowing that
he was out there,

675
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,281
if only I could bring him back.

676
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,448
So, what did you do?

677
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:40,491
There's a creature
in the Northern Marsh

678
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,992
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

679
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,888
What kind of evil
creature-type deal

680
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,364
are we talking here?

681
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,300
When I die, I won't
go to the Underworld.

682
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,036
Now, I belong to him.

683
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,036
So, Harvey Weinstein-type evil.

684
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,004
So, um, what did he give you?

685
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,076
The power to bring Quentin
back without his Shade.

686
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,410
I was so heartbroken,

687
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,726
I thought that
maybe we could just

688
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,844
fix it together
once he returned.

689
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,681
It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

690
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,719
Without his Shade, he...

691
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,591
He wasn't Quentin.

692
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,990
No.

693
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,228
He wanted Fillory for himself.

694
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,397
So, he killed The Beast.

695
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,863
But that wasn't enough.

696
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,931
So, he found a way to kill
Ember, and steal his powers.

697
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,737
But because he killed a god...

698
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,042
The old gods took magic away.

699
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,345
Quentin still had the
power he stole from Ember.

700
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:42,010
He told me that Fillory was
the only thing that he truly loved.

701
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,884
It was always his escape.

702
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,188
He was afraid of magic,

703
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,027
of any Magician who
might bring it back.

704
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,224
Anyone who would oppose him,

705
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,392
take Fillory from him...

706
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,095
And the six fingers, moths...

707
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,097
How'd that shit happen?

708
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,865
I don't know.

709
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,179
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

710
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,475
that he was the only one

Fillory like he did.

712
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,183
I'm sorry.

713
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,279
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

714
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,118
I just... I loved Quentin.

715
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,090
And I wanted to see him again.

716
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,189
It's okay.

717
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,628
Hell no, it's not okay.

718
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,695
All of our friends
died because of you,

719
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,098
because of what you did.

720
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,433
Because of what I did.

721
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,335
Quentin and I used
the Tesla Flexion

722
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,068
to talk to her.

723
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,510
And if we hadn't, Alice
never would've tried

724
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,910
to bring her Quentin back,

725
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,880
and none of this
would've happened.

726
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,474
Whoa, whoa, time
travel headache.

727
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,015
Okay, so, what, just because
you gave her the sads,

728
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,365
it's somehow your fault that
she resurrected a crazy monster

729
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,233
who murdered everybody
and got magic turned off?

730
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,852
I mean, yeah, I guess it's
kind of a little bit your fault,

731
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,086
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

732
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,922
So, why you on this ship anyway?

733

734
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,600

740
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,247
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

741
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,341
so I can try to fix my mistake.

742
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,612
How?

743
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,847

to kill Quentin.

744
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,456

getting somewhere.

traveled to the past

with a knife maker?

The only problem is,

750
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,184
I don't have enough
power to touch it.

756
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,521
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

He fucking died.

Yeah, but...

was gonna happen to him

761
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,607
that he never goddamn told me

762
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,007
because I never
got past the part,

763
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,774
it's called the Quickening,

764
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,212
'cause that's not ominous.

765
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,109
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

766

Alice to The Beast,

776

munching on her entrails,

777

you stab Q-bert in the back.

to use Alice as bait.

her life, okay?

No, it's not that.

already died in this timeline.

give a shit about that?

You.

796

I used you as bait to lure him.

And when I couldn't
get back in time,

798
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,835
he killed you.

799

before because

that to someone again.

up on The Beast.

What did you...

890
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,595
What did you do to me?

891
00:38:58,903 --> 00:38:59,962
It's my Shade.

892
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,571
And I can live
without it if I have to.

893
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,233
(SHUDDERING)

894
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,005
Everything that you
are feeling right now,

895
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,479
I have felt... Grief,
sadness, shame, regret.

896
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,708
Q?

897
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,476
Alice.

898
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,020
(PANTING)

899
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,684
I killed her.

900
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,487
I'm so sorry.

901
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,466
Q?

902
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,069
Where did you find the key?

903
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,073
Um...

904
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,087
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

905
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,808
and I couldn't have that,

906
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,179
so I got it first.

907
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,110
I know why you
were looking for me.

908
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,584
The key...

909
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,754
It showed you
visions of the future...

910
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,187
Me killing you.

911
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,291
Julia...

912
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,725
I'm here to tell you I'm not.

913
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,562
I'm not going to kill you.

914
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,366
I wanna help you.

915
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,532
The visions weren't
of you killing me.

916
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,270
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

917
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,667
You were trying to let magic in,

918
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,679
but you let in
something much worse.

919
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,306
What?

920
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,508
A monster.

921
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,452
One even worse than me.

922
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,752
You should take your Shade back.

923
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,989
(GROANS)

924
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,438
(PANTING)

925
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,123
MARINA 23: You look dumb.

926
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,466
I'm trying to get this stupid
key to open up a door.

927
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,600
Well, isn't there, like,
some kind of ritual for that?

928
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,365
Or... It would be nice

929
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:17,102
if there was, but,
no, so key-waving.

930
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,502
Is that my Josh's jacket?

931
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,837
Yeah.

932
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,937
Hmm.

933
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,843
You look cooler.

934
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,911
You are mean.

935
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,227
So, the key show you anything?

936
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,087
Visions of the future?

937
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,389
Nothing.

938
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,933
Okay.

939
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,462
Then I guess you don't
know that I'm coming with you.

940
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,260
What?

941
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,033
Your Penny's dead, or,

942
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,105
not alive in some confusing way.

943
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,103
Penny, I don't...

944
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,645
I'm not asking permission.

945
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,312
Okay.

946
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:00,779
I'm not her.

947
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:02,685
I know that.

948
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,957
It's just, there's
nothing here for me.

949
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,356
But there?

950
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,153
Give it time.

951
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,185
(DOOR OPENS)

952
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,660
Hey, uh, Jules?

953
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,131
We have a door.

954
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,664
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

955
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,736
I honestly don't know.

956
