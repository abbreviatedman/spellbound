ELIOT: Previously on
The Magicians...

00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,541
No more magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,276
and I get my kingdom back.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,615
We are gonna hunt down

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,985
every last living slaver,

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,048
<i>and hang {hem
by their own entrails.</i>

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,289
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,854
Ember gave her the ability
to create a time loop.

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:20,954
A time loop.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,625
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,191
How many times
have I died?

12
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,669
Thirty-nine- the Alice
from the 23rd timeline

13
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,071
was the sole survivor
of The Beast.

14
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,199
We need to talk to her.
DEAN: Well, you can't

15
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,971
<i>JULIA: Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?</i>

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,411
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

17
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,243
I thought I'd never
see you again.

18
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,146
The Beast, he--
He tore you apart,

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,186
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

20
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,152
but your--
Your Shade, everything.

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,054
(HOWLS) I have
sexually-transmitted lycanthropy.

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,523
It's totally curable.

23
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,585
There is no actual cure.
A silver bullet.

24
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,391
These are my students,
they are in need

25
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,829

So, you wanna tell me where you
hooked up with your partner?

30
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:04,765
Fillory.

31
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,867
If he smells you again,
he won't show.

32
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,379

33
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,437
<i>you might just have
to risk losing your base.</i>

34
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,178
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

35
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,379
Yes.

36
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,046
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

37
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,181
Without the key,
everything collapses,

38
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,248
which is why we can
never give it to you.

39
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,261
ELIOT: I don't know what they
think is going on with my nose.

40
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,921
Yeah, and those
are not my teeth.

41
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,058
And only 1,000 Fillorian
Gold Crescents for us?

42
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,103
Tick is cheap.
It'll be his downfall.

43
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,069
I'll kill him.
Who you gonna kill?

44
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,470
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

45
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,701
Your incursion
into the throne room

46
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,539
put that cheapskate
on red alert.

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,079
Wait, we're
on there too?

48
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,704
You're kings
and queens of Fillory,

49
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,214
so you're a threat
to his reign.

50
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,306
Yeah, well, so was Josh.

51
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,713
I don't see
his face on there.

52
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,720
He was more like a substitute
teacher, didn't count.

53
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,778
We got news.
Uh, Julia sent a bunny.

54
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,586
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

55
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,322
Fucking what?

56
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,392
ELIOT: Hold on,
so, on Earth,

57
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,228
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is--

58
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,426
A good guy, kind of?

59
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,598
Uh-uh.
You know what?

60
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,466
Fuck Tinkerbitch. Fuck her
right in the Egg McMuffin.

61
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,802
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

62
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,969
Unfortunately, she's as
helpful as pubic lice.

63
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,240
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

64
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,407
and I think we should
do it in person.

65
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,348
Sorry, but we're all wanted,

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,420
and Tick's just stepped up the
patrols around the portal tree.

67
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,648
Well, why don't we
just send one of us?

68
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,814
It'll be easier
to break through.

69
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,447
I'll do ii.
You can't.

70
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,254
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

71
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,091
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

72
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,358
It doesn't taste like horse.-.

Yeah, well,
you have to hear it.

00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,211
A lot of the McAllistairs
are dead,

79
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,508
but Irene
is still out there,

80
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,106
and I don't know
what she's going to do.

81
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,516
Slavery, mass murder--

82
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,351

so floral in here.

84
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,892
Next time,
try less rosewater.

85
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,160
Any idea about
how to deal with Irene,

86
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,290
who will doubtless
want her property back?

87
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,498
Well, she'll
have to find it first.

88
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,834
Did you poke out her eyes?

89
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,201
No.

90
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,175
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

91
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,301
You did what?
By yourself?

92
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,674
That's impossible.

93
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,407
That's apparently
what I can do now.

94
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,845
My magic's been growing,

95
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,851
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,923
I would know
if I was lying.

177
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,493
You said we can't
get the Sixth Key,

178
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,721
and visions
of the future?

179
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,524
That has to be the seventh.

180
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,064
Any reason we gotta
do this in order?

181
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,393
I don't know.

182
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,490
Up until now, the book
told us where to go,

183
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,764
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

184
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,099
about where to find
the next one.

185
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,105
Well, maybe this time,
we flip it.

186
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,198
The key quest
has been Q's thing.

187
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,245
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

188
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,870
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

189
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,847
and see what he and the others
have to say about it.

190
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,579
Fine, but I will freely admit
I was getting excited

191
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,120
at the idea of a Josh-Julia
solo adventure.

192
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,518
Sorry.

193
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,580
Yeah, what would
the shippers even call us?

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,559
Josh? Julia? See?

195
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,186
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

196
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,559
Nope.

197
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,138
Where's the portal?

198
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,964
What happened?

199
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,607
The Time Key
sent us to the lab.

200
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,411
Not our lab.

201
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,776
This place is a wreck.

202
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,282
Damn, that was fast.

203
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,777
We're in Timeline 23.

204
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,912
Act out.

205
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,592
This doesn't make sense.

206
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,559
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

207
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,722
It just decided
to send us back here?

208
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,129
What even are the rules?

209
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,164
Beats me--

210
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,824
They're weirdly inconsistent.
Uh-huh.

211
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,836
I guess we have some shit to
take care of in Timeline 23,

212
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,599
maybe key-related.

213
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,504
It worked! They're here!

214
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,472
Marina?

215
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,104
Holy shit.

216
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,945
Wait, you know her?

217
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,451
Of course I do, she was
a year ahead of me,

218
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,986
and hot, um...
(LAUGHS)

219
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,989
Okay, I know you
by reputation,

220
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,252
but how do you know me?

221
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,952
I don't know you here?

222
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,188
No.

223
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,957
You went to Brakebills,

224
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,999
I'm a hedge witch,
we don't mix.

225
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,125
So, what happened
in your timeline?

226
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,967
Um... I didn't go
to Brakebills,

227
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,634
so we became friends.

228
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,003
Friends?

229
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,833
That does not
sound like me.

230
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,673
Wait, you didn't
go to Brakebills?

231
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,543
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

232
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,343
Alternate timeline
shit is weird.

233
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,508
Tell me about it.

234
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,880
Why don't we
go somewhere safer?

235
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,385
We can talk about all this.

236
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,852
JOSH: Jesus,
place hasn't looked

237
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,823
this partied out
since my first year.

238
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,453
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

239
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,355
No clue,
how about in yours?

240
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,624
(SIGHS)

241
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,496
A god was killed by a human.

242
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,192
The old gods took it away
as punishment.

243
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,463
Bunch of Mount
Olympus-sized dicks.

244
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,132
And magic going out here was the
beginning of the end for us.

245
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,697
That Beast started
killing Magicians--

246
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,868
First Brakebills,
then the hedge witches.

247
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,843
So, we joined
forces to survive.

248
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,315
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

249
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,977
is Brakebills really the safest
place for us to hang out?

250
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,021
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

251
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,521
Thinks everyone's dead.

252
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,682
We have scoured
what's left of the place

253
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,192
looking for a way to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

254
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,922
That's how we found
the Tesla Flexion,

255
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,496
and a battery to cast it.

256
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,031
And this sweet jacket

257
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,499
lt's not magic,
but might as well be.

258
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,503
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

259
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,536
Julia can--
(CLEARS THROAT)

260
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,007
Uh, tell you
about it herself.

261
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,045
And it's not even--
It's not even big news.

262
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,602
I don’t know
why I said that...

263
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,041
Your Beast has
some sort of key?

264
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,678
Mmm-hmm.

265
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,344
We need it.

266
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,584
You help us
kill our Beast,

267
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,580
key is yours.

268
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,349
Deal.

269
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,551
Boom.

270
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,184
Let's celebrate, bitches--

271
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,923
Powerful women.

272
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,266
So, Marina, huh?

273
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,027
You know, I've always
had a crush on her.

274
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,194
I know.

275
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,292
Oh.

276
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,803
Right... (LAUGHS)

277
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,433
Hey, what happened
to the glasses'?

278
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,563
Lasik.

279
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,101
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

280
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,305
You are the braver Josh.

281
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,204
I've been
through some shit.

282
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,374
Tell.

283
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,809
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

284
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,080
I ended up stuck--

285
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,054
Stuck in the Neitherlands,
me too.

286
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,284
If the Physical Kids
hadn't shown up,

287
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,483
I don't know how long--

288
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,992
No one ever
showed up for me.

289
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,923
No one made it out?

290
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,291
Some made it out,
they just forgot about me.

291
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,956
Dude.

292
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,970
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

293
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,165
I'd be a lone wolf--
Brave, heroic, solo.

294
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,933
Got Lasik,
found this sweet jacket,

295
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,340
and changed
my fucking life.

296
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,570
Wow.

297
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,312
Is this like that time
when we got that

298
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,641
Kangol hat in middle school

299
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,238
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

300
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,181
No, it's not
like that at all.

301
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,646
Cool.

302
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,318
Inspiring.

303
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,479
And, uh...

304
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,949
(EXHALES) Whew.

305
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,185
Did you--

306
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,519
Did you just roofie me?

307
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,925
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

308
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,523
(GROANS)

309
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,295
Nighty-night.

310
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,834
(GROANING)

311
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,643
What happened?

312
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,374
JULIA: What the hell
are we tied up with?

313
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,845
It was Professor Sunderland's.

314
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,677
Wish I took more
classes with her.

315
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,814
Why are we all tied up?

316
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,644
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

317
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,188
until now.

318
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,689
We're gonna
give you to him.

319
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,320
This is insane.

320
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,360
You can't trust The Beast.

321
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,895
What makes you think he'll make
a deal instead of killing you?

322
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,293
You.

323
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,630
When he showed up here with
his key killing everybody,

324
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,135
he kept asking for you.

325
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,733
I don't understand,
I thought I was dead here.

326
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,569
You are, it was actually
pretty confusing.

327
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,507
So, maybe the guy with
the face full of moths

328
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,409
isn't in the best place
psychologically.

329
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,479
But it gave me an idea.

330
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,072
Give The Beast
what he wants--

331
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,878
Julia, from
an alternate timeline

332
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,680
in exchange
for leaving us alone.

333
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,181
And what about me?

334
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,548
Sorry, bro.

335
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,351
You're the Cedric Diggory
of this story.

336
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,484
At least
he died looking hot.

337
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,194
The Beast
should be here soon.

338
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,888
He can sense magic.

339
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,031
There's no way he'd miss
that Tesla Flexion.

340
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,000
You have another choice.

341
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,096
In our timeline,

342
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,262
we killed The Beast
using a spell--

343
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,600
The Rhinemann Ultra.

344
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,868
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, I've heard of that.

345
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,201
Don't you need
god-level power to cast it?

356
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,650
I promise you, it's real.

357
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,546
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

358
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,278
So, what do you say?

359
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,453
You have this
Rhinemann spell?

360
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,095
Dean Fogg will know where to
find it, if he's still alive.

361
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,628
Oh, he's still alive--

362
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,265
Not exactly the premier
educator he once was.

363
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,236
Kind of a walking
opioid crisis.

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,597
I'll take you to him.

365
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,137
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

366
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,980
Enjoy swapping
puberty stories.

367
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,276
They're the same stories.

JULIA: So, you and Dean Fogg
are on good terms here?

370
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,114
I mean, he did kick me
out of Brakebills,

371
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,160
but he's warmed to me
a bit since then.

372
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,284
Nothing like watching all
of your students and friends

another world to open you up.

374

How do you know him? I thought
you didn't go to Brakebills.

375
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,001
It's complicated.

376
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,969
You fucked him.
No! What?

377
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,834
Okay, defensive much?

378
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,609
He's not that bad
in bed... (CHUCKLES)

379
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,871

you and me in your timeline?

382
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,147
I'm sensing some
weird kinda tension.

383
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,208
Is it the fun kind?

384
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,345
Like I said,
we were friends.

385
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,682
It wasn't always fun.

386
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,282
We got into a big fight,

387
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,558
uh, but we ended up
kinda getting over it.

388
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,021
That's it?

389
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,704
From your face, I was expecting
something a little more...

390
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,135
Dramatic.

391
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,363
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

392
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,699

from me last time?

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,535
Nothing, just forget
I said anything.

another 17 more of these.

Uh, you don't
remember them all?

405

Only the ones
I've been through already.

I thought <i>22</i> was
absolutely dreadful,

until this one.

408
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,481
Is that really necessary?

409
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,083
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

410
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,254
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

411
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,729
No, it doesn't.

412
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,995
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

413

Ah, yes,
the Rhinemann Ultra.

414

00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,505
Unfortunately, she's dead.

416

00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,495
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

You wouldn't happen
to know where Bigby kept it?

00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,189
The spell?

426
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,632
I don't.

427
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,764
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

428
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,330
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

429
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,434
but I sent two students
to see her.

430

(SNIFFS) They died.

431

a bit of a theme.

There's good news.

433
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,349
You see,
their deaths were,

434
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,852
well, earth-shatteringly
horrible.

435
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,047
I mean, really awful...
(CHUCKLES)

436
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,385
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

Wait, so how
is this good news?

438
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,728
Because they're ghosts, dear.

439
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,333
They still haunt the Library,
last I checked--

440
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,663
Pretty deep
in the stacks.

441
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,865
They might
remember the spell.

442
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,132
But I'd be careful
if I were you.

443
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,045
Ghosts, well,
ghosts can be dangerous.

444
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,502
Yeah.

445
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,479
JOSH: How could you
do this to me, man?

446
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,146
You're me,
I'm you, we're us.

447
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,711
I would never
betray myself.

448

You haven't been through
what I've been through.

449
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,483
Yes, I have,
except the Lasik.

450

Whatever.

00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,753
You know, I thought
you were cool

453
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,263
and brave.

454
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,559
And I dug your jacket,

455
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,498
but now I just think
you're a dick,

456
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,537
which sucks, because
that means I'm a dick.

What do you expect?

458
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,904
My friends abandoned me.

459
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,171
Maybe they were right too.

460
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,937
What, did you
roofie and betray them too?

461
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,205
No.

00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,871
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

463

How do you know
what you're gonna do?

464

The Quickening?

465
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,507
What's the Quickening?

466
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,246
I can't think about it.

blood on my hands.

is the Quickening?

to worry about.

didn't bang a werewolf.

most of the school.

most of the ransacking,

any ghosts.

and help me, okay?

What are we doing?

493
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,680
Well, before we
can do the Rhinemann,

494
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,190
we need a power-up.

cast this together,

497
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,264
it might just give us enough
juice to kill The Beast.

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,751
Yeah, I think
I can make it out.

532
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,250
(WHISPERING) I think
someone is following us.

533
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,032
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

534
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,123
<i>0K3'! -</i>

535
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,960
Now!

536
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,266
That's your signal?

537
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,441
Penny?

538
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,874
Julia.

539
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,112
So, it is you.

540
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,646
You're real.

541
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,820
You're alive.

542
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,786
Whoa! Um, uh...

543
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,593
Julia, it's me.

544
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,655
Yeah, I know.

545
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,825
God, it's like I’m..

546
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,730
I'm living in a dream.

547
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,328
Just let me
short-circuit this.

548
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,996
If you think following
two strangers

549
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,803
and then kissing one of them
is dream behavior--

550
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,275
She's not a stranger.

551
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,470
She's my soul mate.

552
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,841
Oh, God.

553
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,512
(STUTTERS) I’m--

554
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,073
I'm actually not your Julia.

555
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,916
You see' I'm from
a different timeline.

556
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,187
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

557
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,328
I'm sorry, I thought--

558
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,761
No, it's-- It's okay.

559
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,027
When I heard a rumor that
The Beast was looking for her

560
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,692
even though she's dead, I--

561
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,133
lt's crazy, but I--

562
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,968
I had to see.

563
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,097
I'm sorry.

564
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,471
It was stupid.

565
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,874
Julia, we gotta
get out of here.

566
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,105
Where are you going?
To kill The Beast.

567
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,375
Let me come with you.
Okay, sorry, buddy,

568
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,143
but we got everything we need,
no baggage necessary.

569
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,981
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

570
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,451
He's a Traveler'
could come in handy.

571
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,352
Eye roll.

572
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,664
It's working,
I can feel it.

573
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,238
(SIGHS)

574
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,300
It's just a lot
of moving pieces.

575
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,209
PENNY 23: Son.

576
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,808
What's up with me
in your timeline?

577
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,312
Well,

578
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,513
you're kind of
in the Underworld.

579
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,055
Not good.

580
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm not sure
you're technically dead.

581
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,254
So, in the Underworld,
but not dead?

582
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,425
That sounds worse.

583
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,101
Truth is,

584
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,396
you got there because
you did something heroic.

585
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:19,070
Unlike my alternate self,
who's a dick,

586
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,735
possibly related
to self-esteem issues,

587
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,405
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

588
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,609
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

589
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,780
Here he comes.

590
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,022
Hey, can I ask you
one last time--

591
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,286
What is the Quickening?

592
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,089
No, you can't.

593
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,958
I don't wanna talk about
my private tragedy,

594
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,190
so unless you want me
to gag you--

595
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,756
Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

596
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,233
Don't call me Dick Josh.

597
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,032
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

598
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,929
lam not a click. I've had
a harder life than you.

599
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,066
Did you?
What makes you so sure?

600
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,441
(SCOFFS) Because you get
to hang outwith Julia,

601
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,807
who is awesome,

602
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,939
and I get Marina,
who is mean all the time.

603
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,106
(CHUCKLES)

604
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,646
Then why do you
hang out with her?

605
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,886
Because when she dies'
it's not going to feel so bad.

606
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,890
Truth is, maybe my friends
abandoned me,

607
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,894
or maybe,
I pushed them away.

608
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,226
Because whatever this
thing is that's looming--

609
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,732
Because unlike me,

610
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,828
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

611
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,995
(SCOFFS)

612
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,282
Don't call me
Dick Josh again.

613
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,344
(CHUCKLES)

614
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,292
Wow.

615
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,991
(MOTHS FLUTTERING)

616
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,631
Oh, shit,
we got company!

617
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,661
I hope you're ready.

618
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,939
(onerous)

619
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,938
Josh, go!

620
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,773
A Josh has to live
to tell our story.

621
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,812
Get back! Anything inside
of 20 feet will be ash!

622
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,856
Julia.

623
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,957
The key didn't lie.

624
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,490
Q?

625
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,068
Getting a little sick
of plot twists.

626
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,535
MARINA 23: Focus, we need
to get out of here.

627
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,537
I can travel, but I can't
take anyone with me

628
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,130
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

629
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,300
JULIA: Let me try.

630
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:49,058
Quentin is The Beast.
Quentin is The Beast?

631
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,150
How the fuck
is Quentin The Beast?

632
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,520
Who's Quentin again?

633
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,097
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

634
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,667
to run away to Fillory
in the first place

635
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,929
and get murdered.

636
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,163
Yeah, by The Beast.

637
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,771
So, you see why
this is confusing?

638
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,176
Doesn't make any sense.

639
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,771
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

640
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,846
She said that
he tore out his Shade,

641
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,350
and destroyed him.

642
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,216
Uh, did he look
destroyed to any of you?

643
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,722
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

644
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,280
I didn't even think
that was possible.

645
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,882
You'd have to have
a lot of power,

646
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,222
like a god.

647
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,559
Oh, we are
in such deep shit.

648
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,861
Maybe we should just stay here
in this branch of The Library.

649
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,966
Hey, Penny'
where are all the Librarians?

650
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,363
I don't know.

651
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,535
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

652
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,973
It's the first place I found
where I couldn't hear The Beast.

653
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,441
Now, is that
The Beast beast,

654
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,105
or the Q Beast,
or is there another Beast?

655
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,116
I think we're missing
some pages of the story here

656
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,243
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

657
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,812
and Quentin is The Beast,
only more powerful.

658
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,652
I know who
we should talk to-

659
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,492
The one person who tried
to bring Quentin back.

660
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,829
Do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

661
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,433
JULIA: Um...
(CLEARS THROAT)

662
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,069
Is there an Alice Quinn
on this boat?

663
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,506
Other cabin.

664
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,806
Thanks.

665
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,476
ALICE 23: I was going
to give up on Quentin.

666
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,943
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

667
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,246
and I couldn't reach it

668
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,412
until your Tesla Flexion
came through.

669
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,014
That changed everything.

670
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,585
Seeing him and hearing
that he loved me,

671
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,097
just knowing that
he was out there,

672
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,292
if only I could
bring him back.

673
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,459
So, what did you do?

674
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:40,502
There's a creature
in the Northern Marsh

675
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,003
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

676
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,865
What kind of evil
creature-type deal

677
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,341
are we talking here?

678
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,311
When I die, I won't
go to the Underworld.

679
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,047
Now, I belong to him.

680
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,047
So, Harvey
Weinstein-type evil.

681
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,015
So, um, what
did he give you?

682
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,053
The power to bring Quentin
back without his Shade.

683
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,387
L was so heartbroken,

684
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,688
I thought that
maybe we could just

685
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,854
fix it together
once he returned.

686
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,691
It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

687
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,730
Without his Shade, he...

688
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,636
He wasn't Quentin.

689
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,001
No.

690
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,239
He wanted
Fillory for himself.

691
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,408
So, he killed The Beast.

692
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,874
But that wasn't enough.

693
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,918
So, he found a way to kill
Ember, and steal his powers.

694
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,748
But because
he killed a god...

695
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,053
The old gods
took magic away.

696
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,356
Quentin still had the power
he stole from Ember.

697
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:42,021
He told me that Fillory was the
only thing that he truly loved.

698
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,895
It was always his escape.

699
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,199
He was afraid of magic,

700
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,037
of any Magician who
might bring it back.

701
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,235
Anyone who would oppose him,

702
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,402
take Fillory from him...

703
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,106
And the six fingers,
moths--

704
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,108
How'd that shit happen?

705
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,876
I don't know.

706
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,190
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

707
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,452
that he was the only one

708
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,686
who appreciated
Fillory like he did.

709
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,194
I'm sorry.

710
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,255
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

711
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,095
L just-- I loved Quentin.

712
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,100
And I wanted
to see him again.

713
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,199
It's okay.

714
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,638
Hell no,
it's not okay.

715
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,706
All Of our friends died
because of you,

716
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,109
because of what you did.

717
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,444
Because of what I did.

718
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,311
Quentin and I used
the Tesla Flexion

719
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,079
to talk to her.

720
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,487
And if we hadn't,
Alice never would've tried

721
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,921
to bring her Quentin back,

722
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,890
and none of this
would've happened.

723
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,485
Whoa, whoa,
time travel headache.

724
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,991
Okay, so, what, just
because you gave her the sads,

725
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,293
it's somehow your fault that she
resurrected a crazy monster

726
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,164
who murdered everybody
and got magic turned off?

727
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,828
I mean, yeah, I guess it's kind
of a little bit your fault,

728
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,065
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

729
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,933
So, why you
on this ship anyway?

730
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,306
What is with
all the bunnies?

731
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,505

of messages or something?

No, I work for them.

(SCOFFS)

737
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,258
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

738
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,317
so I can try
to fix my mistake.

739
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,623
How?

740
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,858
By finding a weapon
to kill Quentin.

741
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,467
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

742
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,102
I found this.

Don't ask me how.

744
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,549
Let me guess--
You traveled to the past

745
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,354
and made a deal
with a knife maker?

746
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,456
The only problem is,

747
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,195
I don't have enough power
to touch it.

748
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,671

00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,640

I'll tell Captain Hopps
I'm leaving.

753
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,532
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

754
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,542
Something did--
He fucking died.

755
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,941
Yeah, but...

756
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,381
It's gonna happen
to me too.

757
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,117
Whatever the holy hell
was gonna happen to him

758
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,584
that he never
goddamn told me

759
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,018
because I never
got past the part,

760
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,751
it's called
the Quickening,

761
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,223
'cause that's not ominous.

762
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,120
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

763
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,632
That's what
I always heard too.

We pop in, we throw
Alice to The Beast,

773
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,736

on her entrails,

774
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,398
Penny pops you behind and you
stab Q-bert in the back.

775
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,669
Marina, I'm not going
to use Alice as bait.

Why not?
I mean, you heard her.

777
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:48,637
This is all her fault,

778
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,508
she wants to fix
what she screwed up.

There are ways
to do this

00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:55,012
without sacrificing
her life, okay?

781
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,517
Are you getting cold feet
because The Beast

782
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,643
is your former best friend,

No, it's not that.

785
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,756
Because people have
already died in this timeline.

786

Basically,
everyone I know--

787
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,691
They're dead because
of short, blonde, and crazy,

788
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,163
and I guess you.

789
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,528
But why would you
give a shit about that?

790
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,192
You just want
your stupid key.

791
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:23,178
I tried to kill a god once
with help from a friend--

792
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,771
You.

793
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,717
I used you as bait
to lure him.

794
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,286
And when I couldn't
get back in time,

795
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,846
he killed you.

796
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,156
I screwed up,
and you died.

00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,886

before because

00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,696
it was my fault.

to someone again.

wanna do?

waltz up on The Beast.

like a beast, but,

You wanna spare him?

you've already tried.

884
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,802

885
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,600
(GASPING)

886
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,311
What did you--

887
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,606
What did you do to me?

888
00:38:58,937 --> 00:38:59,972
It's my Shade.

889
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,548
And I can live
without it if I have to.

890
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,210
(SHUDDERING)

891
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,016
Everything that you
are feeling right now,

892
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,489
I have felt-- Grief,
sadness, shame, regret.

893
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,719
Q?

894
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,487
Alice.

895
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,031
(PANTING)

896
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,695
I killed her.

897
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,498
I'm so sorry.

898
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,477
Q?

899
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,080
Where did you find the key?

900
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,084
Um...

901
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,050
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

902
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,818
and I couldn't have that,

903
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,189
so I got it first.

904
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,086
I know why
you were looking for me.

905
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,595
The key--

906
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,765
It showed you
visions of the future--

907
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,198
Me killing you.

908
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,268
Julia...

909
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,736
I'm here to tell you
I'm not.

910
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,572
I'm not going to kill you.

911
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,377
I wanna help you.

912
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,543
The visions weren't
of you killing me.

913
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:09,281
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

914
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,677
You were trying
to let magic in,

915
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,690
but you let in
something much worse.

916
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,351
What?

917
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,519
A monster.

918
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,463
One even worse than me.

919
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,763
You should take
your Shade back.

920
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,034

MARINA 23:
You look dumb.

923
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:08,476
I'm trying to get this
stupid key to open up a door.

924
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,610
Well, isn't there, like,
some kind of ritual for that?

925
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,342
Or...
It would be nice

926
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:17,113
if there was,
but, no, so key-waving.

927
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,513
Is that my Josh's jacket?

928
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,813
Yeah.

929
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,948
Hmm.

930
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,854
You look cooler.

931
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,922
You are mean.

932
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,261
So, the key
show you anything?

933
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,097
Visions of the future?

934
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,365
Nothing.

935
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,944
<i>0K3'! -</i>

936
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,473
Then I guess you don't know
that I'm coming with you.

937
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,270
What?

938
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,044
Your Penny's dead, or,

939
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,116
not alive
in some confusing way.

940
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,114
Penny, I don't--

941
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,656
I'm not asking permission.

942
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,322
<i>0K3'! -</i>

943
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,789
I'm not her.

944
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:02,696
I know that.

945
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,968
It's just, there's
nothing here for me.

946
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,367
But there?

947
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,164
Give it time.

948
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,196
(DOOR OPENS)

949
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,671
Hey, uh, Jules?

950
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,142
We have a door.

951
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,674
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

952
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,747
I honestly don't know.
