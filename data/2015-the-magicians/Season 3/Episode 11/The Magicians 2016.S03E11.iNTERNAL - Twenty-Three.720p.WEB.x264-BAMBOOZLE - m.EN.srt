00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,266
<i>Previously on</i>
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,516
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

3
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:13,214
and I get my kingdom back.

4
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:17,118
We are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

5
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:20,129
<i>and hang them
by their own entrails.</i>

6
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,346
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

7
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:26,085
Ember gave her the ability
to create a time loop.

8
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:27,157
A time loop.

9
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,877
So far, all the loops
ends in your death.

10
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,154
How many times
have I died?

11
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,896
39...
the Alice from the 23rd timeline

12
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,130
was the sole survivor of
The Beast.

13
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,161
- We need to talk to her.
- Well, you can't.

14
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,863
<i>Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?</i>

15
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:41,667
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

16
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,382
I thought I'd never see
you again.

17
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:44,995
The Beast, he...
he tore you apart,

18
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,088
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

19
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:49,170
but your...
your Shade, everything.

20
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,005
Oh! I have sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy.

21
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,147
It's totally curable.

22
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:56,457
- There is no actual cure.
- A silver bullet.

23
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:58,590
These are my students,
they are in need

24
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,813
of the Rhinemann Ultra.

25
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:02,887
No one but you can be within
20 feet of the blast...

26
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,881
<i>It will kill anyone
including your Beast.</i>

27
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,786
So, you wanna tell me where you
hooked up with your partner?

28
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:10,858
Fillory.

29
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:12,788
If he smells you again,
he won't show.

30
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:14,481
If you want him,

31
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,522
<i>you might just have
to risk losing your base.</i>

32
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:19,920
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

33
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:21,336
- Yes.
- We have

34
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,029
one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

35
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:25,157
Without the key,
everything collapses,

36
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:27,515
which is why we can
never give it to you.

37
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,370
I don't know what they think
is going on with my nose.

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,857
Yeah, and those are not my teeth.

39
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,001
And only 1,000 Fillorian
gold crescents for us?

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,173
Tick is cheap.
It'll be his downfall.

41
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,083
- I'll kill him.
- Who you gonna kill?

42
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,668
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

43
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:43,964
Your incursion
into the throne room

44
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,594
put that cheapskate
on red alert.

45
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:46,911
Wait, we're on there too?

46
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,732
You're
Kings and Queens of Fillory,

47
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,361
so you're
a threat to his reign.

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,729
Yeah, well, so was Josh.
I don't see his face on there.

49
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:55,559
He was more like a substitute
teacher, didn't count.

50
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,690
We got news... Julia sent a bunny.

51
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:00,869
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

52
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,369
Fucking what?

53
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,284
<i>Hold on, so, on Earth,</i>

54
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:07,362
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is...

55
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:10,386
- A good guy, kind of?
- Uh-uh, you know what?

56
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,932
Fuck Tinkerbitch.

57
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,764
Fuck her right in the Egg McMuffin.

58
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:17,047
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

59
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,930
Unfortunately,
she's as helpful as pubic lice.

60
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,211
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

61
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,220
- and I think we should do it in person.
- Sorry, but we're all wanted,

62
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:28,503
and Tick's just stepped up the
patrols around the portal tree.

63
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:31,146
Why don't we just send one of us?
It'll be easier to break through.

64
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,329
- I'll do it.
- You can't.

65
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,407
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

66
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:37,274
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

67
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,914
It doesn't taste like horse...

68
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:45,646
What?

69
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:47,617
<i>Jesus, fuck.</i>

70
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:49,611
I'm...

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,860
I'm much too sober
for all this.

72
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:53,814
Yeah, well, you have to hear it.

73
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,523
A lot of the McAllisters are dead,
but Irene is still out there,

74
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,239
and I don't know what she's going to do.

75
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,583
Slavery,
mass murder...

76
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:04,594
and yet,
it smells so floral in here.

77
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,724
Lucier's cleaning charm.

78
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:09,004
Next time, try less rosewater.

79
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,730
Any idea about
how to deal with Irene,

80
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:14,484
who will doubtless
want her property back?

81
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,774
Well, she'll have to find it first.

82
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:18,935
Did you poke out her eyes?

83
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,222
No.

84
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,143
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

85
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,227
You did what? By yourself?

86
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:26,685
That's impossible.

87
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:28,445
That's apparently what I can do now.

88
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:29,938
My magic's been growing,

89
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,656
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

90
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,414
This is new territory for me.

91
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:37,933
Me too.

92
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,665
Well, look, the school's
yours again, if you want it.

93
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,444
Sober up.

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,068
'Sup.

95
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,804
So, the Fairy Queen
can't give us the Sixth Key.

96
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,513
The Fairy Realm
will collapse without it.

97
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:57,753
Well, that blows.

98
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,116
Honestly, my instructions
ended at talk to Julia.

99
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:04,197
So what are we supposed to do now?

100
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,382
Uhh...

101
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:10,934
How did we end up at Burning Man?

102
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:13,217
We're inside a Tesla Flexion.

103
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,358
Is that a car?

104
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:17,100
A device that allows you to
communicate across timelines.

105
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:20,072
Like, alternate universes-type shit?

106
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,615
Like alternate universes-type shit.

107
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,568
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

108
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:26,861
Usual paradox/explosion
problems?

109
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,731
Someone cast this
to pull us inside.

110
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,702
We just
need to find out who.

111
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,556
Thank God, it worked.

00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,001
It's me.

115

Like, you're me...

116
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:56,294
Okay, calm your shit.
I'm from a different timeline.

117
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,997
You're in a Tesla Flexion,
we only have...

118
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,419
Two minutes.
We know the rules.

119
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,323
Right. Of course. You pulled
Alice into one of these before.

120
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,065
Wait, you're from
that same timeline?

121
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:05,454
That's right.
Look, we need your help.

122
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,373
There's this monster here
killing Magicians.

123
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,192
- We call him The Beast.
- 12 fingers?

124
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,550
Cloud of moths
around his face?

125
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:13,589
Yeah, I tried to get people to
call him Mothra... didn't stick.

126
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:16,895
Here either, can't expect everyone
to be down with the Kaiju classics.

127
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:18,608
Okay, guys,
two minutes, right?

128
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,890
Right, uh, problem is,
magic vanished.

129
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,424
These plumber guys
showed up one day

130
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,218
- and just...
- Shut it off like a faucet.

131
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:27,255
Here, too. But you
guys have no idea why?

132
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,972
No clue,
except the problem is,

133
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,924
we lost magic,
but The Beast didn't.

134
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,473
He was suddenly
unstoppable.

135
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,971
I-I-I-I don't understand. Uh.

136
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,980
So magic is gone, but then
how does he still have it?

137
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,317
Dude, I don't know.

138
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,714
Maybe it has something to do
with this key around his neck.

139
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,159
Wait, what key?

140
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,631
About yea big.

141
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,790
Rumor is, it gives him
visions of the future.

142
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:49,227
Visions of the future...
none of our keys do that.

143
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:50,978
Look, Julia, in my timeline,

144
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,869
you were the best student
Brakebills ever had

145
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,474
until you were horribly murdered.

146
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:56,031
- Oh.
- But with your help,

147
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,796
we might stand a chance
against Mothra.

148
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,304
And Josh, well,
you're me.

149
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,020
No argument there.

150
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,898
Shit, uh, please...
you have to find a way back here.

151
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,264
This is our most
desperate hour.

152
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,337
Help us, Julia and Josh.
You're our only hope.

153
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,476
Ended on a "Star Wars"
reference?

154
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,993
He really knew how to get to me.
We're his new hope.

155
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:22,209
All I'm saying is,
can we even trust him?

156
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,919
Of course we can trust him.
It's me.

157
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,739
I would know if I was lying.

158
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,773
You said we can't get the Sixth Key,
and visions of the future?

159
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:31,313
That has to be the seventh.

160
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,117
Any reason
we gotta do this in order?

161
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:34,314
I don't know.

162
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,358
Up until now,
the book told us where to go,

163
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,848
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

164
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,929
- about where to find the next one.
- Well, maybe this time, we flip it.

165
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,236
The key quest has been
Q's thing.

166
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:46,225
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

167
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:48,874
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

168
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,920
and see what he and the others
have to say about it.

169
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,632
Fine, but I will freely admit
I was getting excited

170
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,237
at the idea of
a Josh-Julia solo adventure.

171
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:57,593
Sorry.

172
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:59,423
Yeah, what would
the shippers even call us?

173
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:02,611
Josh? Julia?
See?

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,551
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

175
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:05,719
Nope.

176
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,215
Where's the portal?

177
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,338
What happened?

178
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,933
The time key sent us to the lab.

179
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,384
Not our lab.

180
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,727
This place is a wreck.

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,523
Damn,
that was fast.

182
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,041
We're in Timeline 23.

183
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:30,947
Act out.

184
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:35,466
This doesn't make sense.

185
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:37,459
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

186
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,779
It just decided to send us back here?

187
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,246
What even are the rules?

188
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,724
Beats me...
they're weirdly inconsistent.

189
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,718
I guess we have some shit
to take care of in Timeline 23,

190
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:48,706
maybe key-related.

191
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,703
It worked!
They're here!

192
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,330
Marina?

193
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,024
Holy shit.

194
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,859
Wait, you know her?

195
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:01,450
Of course I do,
she was a year ahead of me,

196
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,122
and hot, um...

197
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,274
Okay,
I know you by reputation,

198
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:08,136
but how do you know me?

199
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,950
I don't know you here?

200
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,172
No.

201
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,988
You went to Brakebills,

202
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:15,004
I'm a hedge witch,
we don't mix.

203
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,172
So, what happened
in your timeline?

204
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,248
Um, I didn't go to Brakebills,

205
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,631
so we became friends.

206
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,046
Friends?

207
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,113
That does not sound like me.

208
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,678
Wait, you didn't go to Brakebills?

209
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,495
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

210
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:32,293
Alternate timeline shit is weird.

211
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:33,366
Tell me about it.

212
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:35,882
Why don't we go somewhere safer?
We can talk about all this.

213
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:42,032
Jesus, place hasn't looked this
partied out since my first year.

214
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:44,569
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

215
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,177
No clue, how about in yours?

216
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,452
A God was killed by a human.

217
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,217
The Old Gods took it away as punishment.

218
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,567
Bunch of Mount Olympus-sized dicks.

219
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:56,233
And magic going out here was the
beginning of the end for us.

220
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,036
That Beast started killing Magicians...

221
00:08:58,113 --> 00:08:59,928
first Brakebills,
then the hedge witches.

222
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,942
So, we joined forces to survive.

223
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:05,273
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

224
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,948
is Brakebills really the safest
place for us to hang out?

225
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,071
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

226
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,555
Thinks everyone's dead.

227
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:13,715
We have scoured
what's left of the place

228
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,338
looking for away to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

229
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,015
That's how
we found the Tesla Flexion,

230
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,408
and a battery to cast it.

231
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,017
And this sweet jacket.

232
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,520
It's not magic,
but might as well be.

233
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:27,641
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

234
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,221
Julia can...

235
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,839
Uh, tell you about it herself.

236
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,990
And it's not even...
it's not even big news.

237
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,439
I don't know why I said that...

238
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,106
Your Beast has some sort of key?

239
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:39,369
Mm-hmm.

240
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,398
We need it.

241
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,704
You help us kill our Beast,

242
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,969
key is yours.

243
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,315
Deal.

244
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:48,457
Boom.

245
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:50,211
Let's celebrate, bitches...

246
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,094
Powerful women.

247
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,747
So, Marina, huh?

248
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:57,028
You know,
I've always had a crush on her.

249
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,339
I know.

250
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,345
Oh, right...

251
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,570
Hey, what happened to
the glasses?

252
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,894
Lasik.

253
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:06,993
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

254
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,486
You are the braver Josh.

255
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:11,233
I've been through some shit.

256
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,497
Tell.

257
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:15,873
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

258
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:19,086
- I ended up stuck...
- Stuck in the Neitherlands, me too.

259
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:21,476
If the Physical Kids hadn't shown
up, I don't know how long...

260
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:23,222
No one ever showed up for me.

261
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:24,986
No one made it out?

262
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,457
Some made it out,
they just forgot about me.

263
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,306
Dude.

264
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,923
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

265
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:36,198
I'd be a lone wolf...
brave, heroic, solo.

266
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:39,217
Got Lasik, found this sweet jacket,
and changed my fucking life.

267
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,559
Wow.

268
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,494
Is this like that time when we got
that Kangol hat in middle school

269
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:45,219
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

270
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,375
No, it's not like that at all.

271
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,814
Cool.

272
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,164
Inspiring.

273
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,673
And, uh...

274
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,805
Phew.

275
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,241
Did you...

276
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,577
Did you just roofie me?

277
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,767
Nighty-night.

278
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:10,177
Oh, ugh.

279
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:12,724
What happened?

280
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,296
What the hell are
we tied up with?

281
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:16,853
It was Professor Sunderland's.

282
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:18,878
Wish I took more classes
with her.

283
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,014
Why are we all tied up?

284
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:23,812
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

285
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,402
until now.

286
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,769
We're gonna give you to him.

287
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:28,537
This is insane.

288
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,311
You can't trust The Beast.

289
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,805
What makes you think he'll make
a deal instead of killing you?

290
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,113
You.

291
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:37,579
When he showed up here with
his key killing everybody,

292
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:39,560
he kept asking for you.

293
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:41,690
I don't understand, I
thought I was dead here.

294
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,406
You are, it was actually
pretty confusing.

295
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,218
So, maybe the guy with
the face full of moths

296
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,416
isn't in the best place
psychologically.

297
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,689
But it gave me an idea.

298
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,065
Give The Beast what he wants...

299
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:55,764
Julia, from an alternate timeline
in exchange for leaving us alone.

300
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,140
And what about me?

301
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,371
Sorry, bro.

302
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,334
You're the Cedric Diggory of this story.

303
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,359
At least he died looking hot.

304
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,839
The Beast should be here soon.
He can sense magic.

305
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,110
There's no way he'd miss
that Tesla Flexion.

306
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,050
You have another choice.

307
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:11,980
In our timeline,

308
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:14,221
we killed The Beast
using a spell...

309
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:15,533
the Rhinemann Ultra.

310
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:17,846
Yeah,
I've heard of that.

311
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,189
Don't you need
God-level power to cast it?

312
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,379
Yeah,
you do.

313
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,223
Also took care of your migraines,

314
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,405
and smoking addiction... you're welcome.

315
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:55,122
- How did you...
- Long story.

316
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,755
Act out.

317
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:58,164
Easy, cowboy.

318
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,512
I promise you, it's real.

319
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:03,757
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

320
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:05,768
So, what do you say?

321
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,615
You have this
Rhinemann spell?

322
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,079
Dean Fogg will know where to
find it, if he's still alive.

323
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,611
Oh, he's still alive...

324
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:19,185
not exactly the premier
educator he once was.

325
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,413
Kind of a walking opioid crisis.

326
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:23,779
I'll, uh, take you to him.

327
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,377
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

328
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:29,833
Enjoy swapping puberty stories.

329
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:32,455
They're the same stories.

330
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,225
<i>So, you and Dean Fogg
are on good terms here?</i>

331
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,975
I mean, he did kick
me out of Brakebills,

332
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,928
but he's warmed to me
a bit since then.

333
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,204
Nothing like watching
all of your students and friends

334
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:49,060
get murdered by a creature from
another world to open you up.

335
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,349
How do you know him? I thought
you didn't go to Brakebills.

336
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,104
It's complicated.

337
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,996
- You fucked him.
- No! What?

338
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:58,896
Okay,
defensive much?

339
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,871
He's not that bad in bed...

340
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:02,260
Okay...

341
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,481
Hey, speaking of,

342
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,097
what's the deal with
you and me in your timeline?

343
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,233
I'm sensing some weird kinda tension.

344
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:12,736
- Is it the fun kind?
- Like I said, we were friends.

345
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:15,883
It wasn't always fun.

346
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,193
We got into a big fight,

347
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:20,881
but we ended up kinda getting over it.

348
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,310
That's it?

349
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,378
From your face, I was expecting
something a little more...

350
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,046
dramatic.

351
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:31,430
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

352
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,927
This way?

353
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,317
Marina.

354
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,382
Aww, come on.

355
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,062
I won't steal anything
from you this time.

356
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,099
What did you steal from me last time?

357
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,738
Nothing, just forget I said anything.

358
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:03,607
Just... I found an
old student of yours, okay?

359
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:27,508
Come in.

360
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,683
Timeline 40?

361
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:40,794
I have to live through
another 17 more of these.

362
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:42,994
Uh, you don't
remember them all?

363
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,935
Only the ones
I've been through already.

364
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:47,491
I thought 22 was
absolutely dreadful,

365
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:48,912
until this one.

366
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,393
Is that really necessary?

367
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,064
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

368
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,135
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

369
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,648
No, it doesn't.

370
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:05,137
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

371
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,567
Ah, yes, the Rhinemann Ultra.

372
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,601
My friend Bigby had that.

373
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,866
Unfortunately, she's dead.

374
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:15,180
Everything went to shit when magic died.

375
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:17,251
Creatures got set upon,

376
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,865
chopped up to steal their mojo.

377
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,374
That poor thing.

378
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:27,173
I killed a leprechaun once.

379
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,789
I'm not proud.

380
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,794
Just saying.

381
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,469
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

382
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:38,339
You wouldn't happen to know
where Bigby kept it? The spell?

383
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:39,705
I don't.

384
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:42,378
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

385
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:45,505
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

386
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,545
but... I sent two students
to see her.

387
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,230
They died.

388
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,019
Seems to be
a bit of a theme.

389
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:53,339
There's good news.

390
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,311
You see, their deaths were,

391
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,643
well, earth-shatteringly horrible.
I mean, really awful...

392
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,197
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

393
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:05,699
Wait, so how is this good news?

394
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:08,639
Because they're ghosts, dear.

395
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:11,324
They still haunt the library,
last I checked...

396
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,915
pretty deep in the stacks.

397
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,020
They might remember the spell.

398
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:19,119
But... I'd be careful
if I were you.

399
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,281
Ghosts, well,
ghosts can be dangerous.

400
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,800
Yeah.

401
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,620
<i>How could you do this to me,
man?</i>

402
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:31,059
You're me, I'm you, we're us.

403
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,716
I would never betray myself.

404
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,330
You haven't been through
what I've been through.

405
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,671
Yes I have, except the Lasik.

406
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,869
There's more than that.

407
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,052
Whatever.

408
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,586
You know,
I thought you were cool

409
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,166
and brave.

410
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,480
And I dug your jacket, but now
I just think you're a dick,

411
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,810
which sucks,
because that means I'm a dick.

412
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,381
What do you expect?

413
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,183
My friends abandoned me.

414
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:53,054
Maybe they were right too.

415
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:54,849
What, did you
roofie and betray them too?

416
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:56,097
No.

417
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,892
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

418
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,607
How do you know what you're gonna do?

419
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:00,916
The Quickening?

420
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:02,745
What's The Quickening?

421
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:05,576
I can't think about it. I don'
want all their blood on my hands.

422
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:07,479
What the hell is The Quickening?

423
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:09,095
Nothing you need to worry about.

424
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:10,669
Just be glad you didn't bang a werewolf.

425
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:13,613
Let's talk about something else, okay?
Now I need an aspirin.

426
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:19,690
<i>[EERIE MUSIC]</i>

427
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,438
Yeah, the library got ransacked

428
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,911
after The Beast took out
most of the school.

429
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,120
Honestly,
I did most of the ransacking,

430
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,749
but I didn't see
any ghosts.

431
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,502
Eliot, holy shit!

432
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:37,758
Oh, what the hell was that?

433
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,796
I think I know
the students who died here.

434
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,113
- Eliot and...
- <i>Margo?</i>

435
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,183
I told you we need to
get our shit together, Eliot.

436
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,059
I have my shit together.

437
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:55,276
No, you're holding
your shit together, barely.

438
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,040
There's a difference.

439
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,512
Don't let that pixie twat
Bigby get in your head.

440
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,468
She called me a lush,

441
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:05,700
which is basically just
a nice way of saying alcoholic.

442
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,592
And she said
I couldn't handle the spell.

443
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,507
Why don't you prove her wrong
and help me, okay?

444
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:12,994
What are we doing?

445
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:16,231
Well, before we can do the
Rhinemann, we need a power-up.

446
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,606
Here is a cooperative spell.

447
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,710
Now, if we can cast this
together,

448
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,473
it might just give us
enough juice to kill The Beast.

449
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:25,222
And if we cast it wrong,

450
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,263
kaboom.

451
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,828
So, let's not cast it wrong.

452
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:34,619
- What if Bigby was right?
- What if I am too drunk?

453
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,297
What if I screw it up?

454
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:39,101
Ack!

455
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,160
You are not gonna
cock out on me.

456
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:43,314
Cock out?

457
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,925
I'd say pussy,
but let's be honest.

458
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,761
Which one is tougher?

459
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:50,328
Point made.

460
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:00,534
Oh God, oh God...

461
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:09,429
I screwed up, I screwed up,
I screwed up, I screwed...

462
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:12,228
ah, ah, ah, ah...

463
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:16,401
Ugh... Oh!

464
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,470
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up, I screwed it up,

465
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,828
I screwed it up, I screwed it up,
I screwed it up,

466
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:23,912
I screwed it up,

467
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:25,331
I screwed it up...

468
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,545
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up...

469
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:29,836
Bambi?

470
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,047
Where's my Bambi?

471
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,518
Where's my Bambi?

472
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:39,706
- Come on... oh!
- Jesus Christ!

473
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,804
Cocks.

474
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,627
- Ugh, yuck, that was...
- So yuck.

475
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,527
Not fun at all.

476
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,275
Please tell me
you got that spell.

477
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:54,601
Yeah, I, uh,
I think I can make it out.

478
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,937
I think
someone is following us.

479
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,034
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

480
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,303
Okay.

481
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,945
- Now!
- That's your signal?

482
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:15,461
Penny?

483
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:17,257
Julia.

484
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:21,223
So, it is you.

485
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,983
You're real.

486
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:26,843
You're alive.

487
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:35,800
Whoa, um, um...

488
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,608
Julia, it's me.

489
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:40,071
- Yeah, I... I know.
- God, it's like I'm...

490
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,265
- I'm living in a dream.
- Just let me short-circuit this.

491
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,133
If you think
following two strangers

492
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:47,837
and then kissing one of them
is dream behavior...

493
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:49,232
She's not a stranger.

494
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,512
She's my soul mate.

495
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,878
Oh, God.

496
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,371
Um, I'm...

497
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:57,550
I'm actually not your Julia.

498
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:01,714
You see,
I'm from a different timeline.

499
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:05,543
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

500
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,225
I'm sorry, I thought-

501
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:09,914
- No, it's... it's okay.

502
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,295
When I heard a rumor that The
Beast was looking for her

503
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,845
even though she's dead, I...

504
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,434
it's crazy, but I...

505
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:17,642
I had to see.

506
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:20,204
I'm sorry.

507
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:21,427
It was stupid.

508
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:22,888
Julia, we gotta
get out of here.

509
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:25,008
- Where are you going?
- To kill The Beast.

510
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,343
- Let me come with you.
- Okay, sorry, buddy,

511
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,092
but we got everything we need,
no baggage necessary.

512
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,903
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

513
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:34,724
He's a traveler,
could come in handy.

514
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:38,586
Eye roll.

515
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:48,875
It's working, I can feel it.

516
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,746
It's just a lot of moving pieces.

517
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,505
So...

518
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:03,930
what's up with me
in your timeline?

519
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:05,447
Well,

520
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,873
you're kind of in the Underworld.

521
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,177
Not good.

522
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,898
I'm not sure
you're technically dead.

523
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,040
So, in the Underworld,
but not dead?

524
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,462
That... sounds worse.

525
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,940
Truth is,

526
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:24,609
you got there because
you did something heroic.

527
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,892
Unlike my alternate self,
who's a dick,

528
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,791
possibly related to
self-esteem issues,

529
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,215
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

530
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:36,853
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

531
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,602
Here he comes.

532
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:44,109
Hey, can I ask you one last time...

533
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:45,378
what is The Quickening?

534
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,073
No, you can't.

535
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,004
I don't wanna talk about
my private tragedy,

536
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:52,833
- so unless you want me to gag you...
- Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

537
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,193
Don't call me Dick Josh.

538
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,257
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

539
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,887
I am not a dick.
I've had harder life than you.

540
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:01,167
Did you?
What makes you so sure?

541
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:03,524
Because
you get to hang out with Julia,

542
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:04,847
who is awesome,

543
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:07,938
and I get Marina,
who is mean all the time.

544
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:11,564
Then why do you hang out
with her?

545
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:15,388
Because when she dies,
it's not going to feel so bad.

546
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:17,885
Truth is,
maybe my friends abandoned me,

547
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,909
or maybe, I pushed them away.

548
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:22,420
Because whatever
this thing is that's looming...

549
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:25,677
because... unlike me,

550
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,800
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

551
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:41,424
Don't call me Dick Josh again.

552
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:52,227
Wow.

553
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:00,812
Oh shit, we got company!

554
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:05,044
I hope you're ready.

555
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:11,975
Josh, go!

556
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,976
A Josh has to live
to tell our story.

557
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,734
Get back! Anything inside
of 20 feet will be ash!

558
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:29,100
Julia.

559
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:31,992
The key didn't lie.

560
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:33,347
Q?

561
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,035
Getting a little sick of
plot twists.

562
00:25:35,112 --> 00:25:36,545
Focus, we need to get
out of here.

563
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,395
I can travel, but I can't
take anyone with me

564
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:40,089
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

565
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:41,374
Let me try.

566
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:56,272
<i>Quentin is The Beast.</i>

567
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:59,108
Quentin is The Beast?

568
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,158
How the fuck is Quentin The Beast?

569
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,661
Who's Quentin again?

570
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:06,060
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

571
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,667
to run away to Fillory in the
first place and get murdered.

572
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,137
Yeah, by The Beast.

573
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:13,974
So, you see
why this is confusing?

574
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:17,344
Doesn't make any sense.

575
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:20,791
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

576
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:24,223
She said that he tore out his
Shade, and destroyed him.

577
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:27,250
Uh, did he look destroyed
to any of you?

578
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:29,723
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

579
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,334
I didn't even think
that was possible.

580
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:34,031
You'd have to have a lot of power,
like a God.

581
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,394
Oh, we are in such deep shit.

582
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:40,136
Maybe we should just stay here
in this branch of the library.

583
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,092
Hey Penny,
where are all the Librarians?

584
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,409
I don't know.

585
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:46,567
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

586
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:48,717
It's the first place I found
where I couldn't hear The Beast.

587
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:50,520
Now, is that The Beast beast,

588
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:53,984
or the Q beast,
or is there another beast?

589
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:57,154
I think we're missing
some pages of the story here

590
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,372
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

591
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:02,731
and Quentin is The Beast,
only more powerful.

592
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,885
I know who
we should talk to...

593
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:07,593
the one person who tried
to bring Quentin back.

594
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:10,978
Do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

595
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:16,889
Um...

596
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:19,803
is there an Alice Quinn on this boat?

597
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,369
Other cabin.

598
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:24,119
Thanks.

599
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,449
I was going to
give up on Quentin.

600
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:31,070
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

601
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:32,399
and I couldn't reach it

602
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:34,859
until your
Tesla Flexion came through.

603
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:36,981
That changed everything.

604
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:40,611
Seeing him and hearing
that he loved me...

605
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,364
just knowing that he was out there,
if only I could bring him back.

606
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:47,542
So, what did you do?

607
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:50,067
There's a creature in the Northern Marsh

608
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:53,215
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

609
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:57,078
What kind of evil creature-type
deal are we talking here?

610
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,391
When I die,
I won't go to the Underworld.

611
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,680
Now, I belong to him.

612
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:05,316
So, Harvey Weinstein-type evil.

613
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,035
So, um,
what did he give you?

614
00:28:09,193 --> 00:28:12,309
The power to bring
Quentin back without his Shade.

615
00:28:12,468 --> 00:28:14,765
I was so heartbroken, I thought
that maybe we could just

616
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,052
fix it together once he returned.

617
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,801
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

618
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:24,068
Without his Shade, he...

619
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,992
- He wasn't Quentin.
- No.

620
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,879
He wanted Fillory for himself.

621
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,651
So, he killed The Beast.

622
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,286
But that wasn't enough.

623
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:38,790
So, he found a way to kill Ember,
and steal his powers.

624
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:41,025
But because he killed a God...

625
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:43,382
The Old Gods took
magic away.

626
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,168
Quentin still had the power
he stole from Ember.

627
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:52,254
He told me that Fillory was the
only thing that he truly loved.

628
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:55,205
It was always his escape.

629
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,253
He was afraid of magic,

630
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,919
of any Magician
who might bring it back.

631
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:03,140
Anyone who would
oppose him,

632
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,668
take Fillory from him...

633
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:09,353
And the six fingers, moths...

634
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,021
how'd that shit happen?

635
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:12,661
I don't know.

636
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,203
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

637
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:21,103
that he was the only one who
appreciated Fillory like he did.

638
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:23,130
I'm sorry.

639
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:27,031
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I just... I loved Quentin.

640
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,144
And I wanted to see him
again.

641
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,225
It's okay.

642
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,839
Hell no, it's not okay.

643
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:36,580
All of our friends died
because of you,

644
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:38,855
because of what you did.

645
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,220
Because of what I did.

646
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:44,692
Quentin and I used the Tesla Flexion

647
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:46,320
to talk to her.

648
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,613
And if we hadn't,
Alice never would've tried

649
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:51,263
to bring her Quentin back,

650
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,070
and none of this
would've happened.

651
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:55,458
Whoa, whoa,
time travel headache.

652
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:57,984
Okay, so, what, just
because you gave her the sads,

653
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,363
it's somehow your fault that
she resurrected a crazy monster

654
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,775
who murdered everybody and got
magic turned off? I mean, yeah,

655
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,845
I guess it's kind of
a little bit your fault,

656
00:30:04,914 --> 00:30:07,131
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

657
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,790
So, why you on this ship
anyway?

658
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,152
What is with all the bunnies?

659
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:13,548
Are you trying to send
a bunch of messages or something?

660
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,917
No, I work for them.

661
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,356
They're radish smugglers, I...

662
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:22,045
I stack boxes.
It's the only thing they can't do.

663
00:30:23,534 --> 00:30:26,247
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

664
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:28,332
so I can try to fix my mistake.

665
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:29,598
How?

666
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:32,220
By finding a weapon to kill Quentin.

667
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,496
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

668
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,914
I found this.

669
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:50,688
Don't ask me how.

670
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:58,624
Let me guess...
you traveled to the past

671
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:00,528
and made a deal with a knife maker?

672
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,492
The only problem is,

673
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,006
I don't have enough power to touch it.

674
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:20,810
I do.

675
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,864
I'll tell Captain Hopps
I'm leaving.

676
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:40,596
Found some carrot wine.

677
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:45,204
The other Josh

678
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:48,453
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

679
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:51,417
Something did... he fucking died.

680
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:53,966
Yeah, but...

681
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:56,446
It's gonna happen
to me too.

682
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:59,094
Whatever the holy hell
was gonna happen to him

683
00:31:59,163 --> 00:32:01,993
that he never goddamn told me
because I never got past the part,

684
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,072
it's called The Quickening,

685
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:06,360
'cause that's not ominous.

686
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:11,286
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

687
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:13,370
That's what
I always heard too.

688
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:17,285
Turns out,
it's murder herpes.

689
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:20,384
So, yay.

690
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:24,491
If I find out I may turn into
a monster and kill everyone,

691
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:26,987
I'd run far away.

692
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,490
'Cause if you're near Julia
when that happens,

693
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:34,318
I'll kill you myself, Dick Josh.

694
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,276
- We can't do that.
- But it totally works.

695
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:49,233
We pop in,
we throw Alice to The Beast,

696
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:50,874
and when he's munching
on her entrails,

697
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:53,221
Penny pops you behind and
you stab Q-bert in the back.

698
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,574
Marina, I'm not going
to use Alice as bait.

699
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:58,610
Why not? I mean, you heard her.
This is all her fault,

700
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,537
she wants to fix
what she screwed up.

701
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,996
There are ways to do this without
sacrificing her life, okay?

702
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:07,794
Are you getting cold feet because The
Beast is your former best friend,

703
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,342
the... unimpressive white guy?

704
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,893
No, it's not that.

705
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:13,719
Because people have already
died in this timeline.

706
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:15,155
Basically, everyone I know...

707
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:19,001
they're dead because of short,
blonde, and crazy, and I guess you.

708
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:22,306
But why would you give a shit about
that? You just want your stupid key.

709
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:33,499
I tried to kill a God once
with help from a friend...

710
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,724
you.

711
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,705
I used you as bait to lure him.

712
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:43,425
And when I couldn't get back
in time, he killed you.

713
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:47,301
I screwed up, and you died.

714
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:50,828
And it was horrible.

715
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:52,959
Jesus Christ.

716
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:54,420
I'm so sorry.

717
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:56,683
I couldn't tell you before because

718
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,298
it was my fault.

719
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:03,286
And I can never do that
to someone again.

720
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,953
So, what do you wanna do?
I mean, this shit is dangerous.

721
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:12,241
We can't just waltz up
on The Beast.

722
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,348
He may act like a beast, but,

723
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,533
deep down, he's the Quentin
I've always known.

724
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:24,851
So, what are you saying?
You wanna spare him?

725
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:29,673
I wanna use that against him.

726
00:34:39,684 --> 00:34:41,509
Uh, wow.

727
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:45,966
He... really let the place go.

728
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:47,769
What is all this shit?

729
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,894
The Winter's Doe...

730
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:57,336
what's... left of her.

731
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:00,585
Jesus, did he eat her?

732
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:04,406
These are the polished rocks
from the Silver Banks.

733
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:07,465
That's where Martin Chatwin
learned to skip rocks.

734
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:12,462
This is a bugle from Brass City.

735
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,830
Rupert learned to play on this.

736
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:18,579
- You guys, this isn't trash.
- No.

737
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:23,371
This is a "Fillory and
Further" fan boy's collection.

738
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,134
It's trash.

739
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:27,479
Quentin's been hoarding this.

740
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:46,538
You're not a very good player,

741
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:47,897
whoever you are.

742
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,477
Hilarious.

743
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,757
Alice?

744
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:08,180
I can smell you.

745
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:10,767
Why don't you come on out?

746
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:12,126
He knows I'm here.

747
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,853
Hurry, quick, let's go.

748
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,100
I'm trying.

749
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:19,390
Shit, he must've cast a ward.
I can't travel into the throne room.

750
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,650
Fine, you don't wanna come out?

751
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,286
Then I will...

752
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:28,472
fill the room with fire.

753
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:32,769
You guys stay,
I'll go.

754
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,066
- No, Alice, don't.
- I have to.

755
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:39,506
If I don't, he'll kill all of us.

756
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:46,764
I'm here, Quentin.

757
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,837
Wait.

758
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:53,656
I am the only one
who can stop him.

759
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:04,473
I made a mistake.

760
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:08,346
- I should never have run from you.
- That's what I said.

761
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,456
You killed every
Magician you could find,

762
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,687
except me.

763
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,219
Why?

764
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:19,132
I thought about it,
but you were doing

765
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,562
such a good job of
torturing yourself.

766
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:24,318
And the others, I...

767
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:29,594
I could say that they were a threat,
but honestly, I just realized

768
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:32,003
that I didn't like them
very much.

769
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:34,496
Doesn't sound like you.

770
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,887
I know you.

771
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,564
You knew me.

772
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:43,220
You're not Martin Chatwin, you're
not The Beast... you hate The Beast.

773
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:44,674
True.

774
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:49,873
But you show up with a face full of moths,
and everyone loses their shit.

775
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,483
People think that
The Beast

776
00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:59,768
is invincible.

777
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,577
Who wouldn't use that
to their advantage?

778
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,827
I think that he would be flattered

779
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:14,959
I did a Dread Pirate Roberts.

780
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,986
"The Princess Bride."

781
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,845
Please, Quentin.

782
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:24,389
I know the man that I love
is still inside you somewhere.

783
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,194
Yeah, I ate him.

784
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:28,872
Okay, this is obviously

785
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:31,752
a ploy to buy your friends time,

786
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:34,424
so why don't we just get
this over with?

787
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,741
That's a familiar scent.

788
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:49,184
Julia.

789
00:38:52,077 --> 00:38:54,396
You can't kill me, you've already tried.

790
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:05,221
What did you...

791
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,136
what did you do to me?

792
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,354
It's my Shade.

793
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:10,291
And I can live without it
if I have to.

794
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:14,026
Everything that you are
feeling right now,

795
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:17,247
I have felt...
grief, sadness, shame, regret.

796
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:19,062
Q?

797
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:23,467
Alice.

798
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,012
I killed her.

799
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:34,756
I'm so sorry.

800
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:37,648
Q?

801
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:41,358
Where did you find the key?

802
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,268
Um...

803
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:47,852
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

804
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,362
and I couldn't have that,
so I got it first.

805
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:55,174
I know why you were looking for me.
The key...

806
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,003
it showed you visions of the future...

807
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,411
me killing you.

808
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:02,191
Julia...

809
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,978
I'm here to tell you I'm not.

810
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:07,178
I'm not going to kill you.

811
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,642
I wanna help you.

812
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:12,996
The visions weren't of you
killing me.

813
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:17,540
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

814
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:22,784
You were trying to let magic in, but
you let in something much worse.

815
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:24,610
What?

816
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:26,654
A monster.

817
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,713
One even worse than me.

818
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:35,091
You should take your Shade back.

819
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:12,224
You look dumb.

820
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:16,472
I'm trying to get this
stupid key to open up a door.

821
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:20,024
Well, isn't there, like, some
kind of ritual for that? Or...

822
00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:21,335
It would be nice

823
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:25,459
if there was, but no,
so, key-waving.

824
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:28,565
Is that my Josh's jacket?

825
00:41:28,676 --> 00:41:29,828
Yeah.

826
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:32,442
Hm, you look cooler.

827
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,040
You are mean.

828
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:44,486
So, the key show you anything?

829
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,862
Visions of the future?

830
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:48,571
Nothing.

831
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:49,937
Okay.

832
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:52,757
Then I guess you don't know
that I'm coming with you.

833
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,284
What?

834
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:56,197
Your Penny's dead, or,

835
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:59,407
not alive in some
confusing way.

836
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,616
- Penny, I don't...
- I'm not asking permission.

837
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:05,517
Okay.

838
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:09,123
I'm not her.

839
00:42:09,303 --> 00:42:10,763
I know that.

840
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:13,936
It's just,
there's nothing here for me.

841
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:15,267
But there?

842
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:17,629
Give it time.

843
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,456
Hey, uh, Jules?

844
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:23,165
We have a door.

845
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:29,775
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

846
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:31,742
I honestly don't know.
