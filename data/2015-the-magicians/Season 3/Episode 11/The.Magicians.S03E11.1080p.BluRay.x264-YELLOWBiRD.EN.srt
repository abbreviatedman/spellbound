1
00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:02,466
<i>Previously on</i>
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,716
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

3
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:07,414
and I get my kingdom back.

4
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:11,318
We are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

5
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,329
<i>and hang them
by their own entrails.</i>

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,546
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

7
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:20,285
Ember gave her the ability
to create a time loop.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,357
A time loop.

9
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:23,077
So far, all the loops
ends in your death.

10
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:24,354
How many times
have I died?

11
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:27,096
39...
the Alice from the 23rd timeline

12
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,330
was the sole survivor of
The Beast.

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,361
- We need to talk to her.
- Well, you can't.

14
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:33,063
<i>Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?</i>

15
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,867
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

16
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:37,582
I thought I'd never see
you again.

17
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:39,195
The Beast, he...
he tore you apart,

18
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,288
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

19
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:43,370
but your...
your Shade, everything.

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,205
Oh! I have sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy.

21
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,347
It's totally curable.

22
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,657
- There is no actual cure.
- A silver bullet.

23
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:52,790
These are my students,
they are in need

24
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,013
of the Rhinemann Ultra.

25
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:57,087
No one but you can be within
20 feet of the blast...

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,081
<i>It will kill anyone
including your Beast.</i>

27
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:03,986
So, you wanna tell me where you
hooked up with your partner?

28
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:05,058
Fillory.

29
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:06,988
If he smells you again,
he won't show.

30
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,681
If you want him,

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,722
<i>you might just have
to risk losing your base.</i>

32
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,120
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

33
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,536
- Yes.
- We have

34
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,229
one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

35
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:19,357
Without the key,
everything collapses,

36
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,715
which is why we can
never give it to you.

37
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,570
I don't know what they think
is going on with my nose.

38
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,057
Yeah, and those are not my teeth.

39
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:30,201
And only 1,000 Fillorian
gold crescents for us?

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,373
Tick is cheap.
It'll be his downfall.

41
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,283
- I'll kill him.
- Who you gonna kill?

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,868
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

43
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,164
Your incursion
into the throne room

44
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,794
put that cheapskate
on red alert.

45
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,111
Wait, we're on there too?

46
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,932
You're
Kings and Queens of Fillory,

47
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,561
so you're
a threat to his reign.

48
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,929
Yeah, well, so was Josh.
I don't see his face on there.

49
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,759
He was more like a substitute
teacher, didn't count.

50
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:51,890
We got news... Julia sent a bunny.

51
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:55,069
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

52
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,569
Fucking what?

53
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,484
<i>Hold on, so, on Earth,</i>

54
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:01,562
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is...

55
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,586
- A good guy, kind of?
- Uh-uh, you know what?

56
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,132
Fuck Tinkerbitch.

57
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,964
Fuck her right in the Egg McMuffin.

58
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:11,247
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

59
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:14,130
Unfortunately,
she's as helpful as pubic lice.

60
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,411
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,420
- and I think we should do it in person.
- Sorry, but we're all wanted,

62
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,703
and Tick's just stepped up the
patrols around the portal tree.

63
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,346
Why don't we just send one of us?
It'll be easier to break through.

64
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:26,529
- I'll do it.
- You can't.

65
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:28,607
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

66
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:31,474
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

67
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,114
It doesn't taste like horse...

68
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:39,846
What?

69
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,817
<i>Jesus, fuck.</i>

70
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:43,811
I'm...

71
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm much too sober
for all this.

72
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,014
Yeah, well, you have to hear it.

73
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,723
A lot of the McAllisters are dead,
but Irene is still out there,

74
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,439
and I don't know what she's going to do.

75
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,783
Slavery,
mass murder...

76
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:58,794
and yet,
it smells so floral in here.

77
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:00,924
Lucier's cleaning charm.

78
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,204
Next time, try less rosewater.

79
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:05,930
Any idea about
how to deal with Irene,

80
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,684
who will doubtless
want her property back?

81
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:10,974
Well, she'll have to find it first.

82
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,135
Did you poke out her eyes?

83
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:14,422
No.

84
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:17,343
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

85
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,427
You did what? By yourself?

86
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:20,885
That's impossible.

87
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,645
That's apparently what I can do now.

88
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,138
My magic's been growing,

89
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,856
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

90
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,614
This is new territory for me.

91
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:32,133
Me too.

92
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,865
Well, look, the school's
yours again, if you want it.

93
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,644
Sober up.

94
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,268
'Sup.

95
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,004
So, the Fairy Queen
can't give us the Sixth Key.

96
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,713
The Fairy Realm
will collapse without it.

97
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:51,953
Well, that blows.

98
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,316
Honestly, my instructions
ended at talk to Julia.

99
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:58,397
So what are we supposed to do now?

100
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:02,582
Uhh...

101
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:05,134
How did we end up at Burning Man?

102
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:07,417
We're inside a Tesla Flexion.

103
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:08,558
Is that a car?

104
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:11,300
A device that allows you to
communicate across timelines.

105
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:14,272
Like, alternate universes-type shit?

106
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:16,815
Like alternate universes-type shit.

107
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,768
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

108
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:21,061
Usual paradox/explosion
problems?

109
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,931
Someone cast this
to pull us inside.

110
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:24,902
We just
need to find out who.

111
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,756
Thank God, it worked.

112
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:44,582
Holy mirror universes,
Batman.

113
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,201
It's me.

114
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,374
Like, you're me...

115
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,494
Okay, calm your shit.
I'm from a different timeline.

116
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:52,197
You're in a Tesla Flexion,
we only have...

117
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,619
Two minutes.
We know the rules.

118
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,523
Right. Of course. You pulled
Alice into one of these before.

119
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,265
Wait, you're from
that same timeline?

120
00:04:58,334 --> 00:04:59,654
That's right.
Look, we need your help.

121
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:01,573
There's this monster here
killing Magicians.

122
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:03,392
- We call him The Beast.
- 12 fingers?

123
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,750
Cloud of moths
around his face?

124
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:07,789
Yeah, I tried to get people to
call him Mothra... didn't stick.

125
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:11,095
Here either, can't expect everyone
to be down with the Kaiju classics.

126
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,808
Okay, guys,
two minutes, right?

127
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:15,090
Right, uh, problem is,
magic vanished.

128
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,624
These plumber guys
showed up one day

129
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,418
- and just...
- Shut it off like a faucet.

130
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:21,455
Here, too. But you
guys have no idea why?

131
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,172
No clue,
except the problem is,

132
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,124
we lost magic,
but The Beast didn't.

133
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,673
He was suddenly
unstoppable.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,171
I-I-I-I don't understand. Uh.

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,180
So magic is gone, but then
how does he still have it?

136
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,517
Dude, I don't know.

137
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:35,914
Maybe it has something to do
with this key around his neck.

138
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,359
Wait, what key?

139
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:38,831
About yea big.

140
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,990
Rumor is, it gives him
visions of the future.

141
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:43,427
Visions of the future...
none of our keys do that.

142
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,178
Look, Julia, in my timeline,

143
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,069
you were the best student
Brakebills ever had

144
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,674
until you were horribly murdered.

145
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:50,231
- Oh.
- But with your help,

146
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,996
we might stand a chance
against Mothra.

147
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:54,504
And Josh, well,
you're me.

148
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,220
No argument there.

149
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:59,098
Shit, uh, please...
you have to find a way back here.

150
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,464
This is our most
desperate hour.

151
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,537
Help us, Julia and Josh.
You're our only hope.

152
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,676
Ended on a "Star Wars"
reference?

153
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:14,193
He really knew how to get to me.
We're his new hope.

154
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,409
All I'm saying is,
can we even trust him?

155
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,119
Of course we can trust him.
It's me.

156
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:20,939
I would know if I was lying.

157
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,973
You said we can't get the Sixth Key,
and visions of the future?

158
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,513
That has to be the seventh.

159
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:27,317
Any reason
we gotta do this in order?

160
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,514
I don't know.

161
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,558
Up until now,
the book told us where to go,

162
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,048
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

163
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:36,129
- about where to find the next one.
- Well, maybe this time, we flip it.

164
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,436
The key quest has been
Q's thing.

165
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,425
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

166
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,074
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

167
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,120
and see what he and the others
have to say about it.

168
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,832
Fine, but I will freely admit
I was getting excited

169
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,437
at the idea of
a Josh-Julia solo adventure.

170
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:51,793
Sorry.

171
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,623
Yeah, what would
the shippers even call us?

172
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:56,811
Josh? Julia?
See?

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,751
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

174
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,919
Nope.

175
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,415
Where's the portal?

176
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,538
What happened?

177
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:13,133
The time key sent us to the lab.

178
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,584
Not our lab.

179
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,927
This place is a wreck.

180
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,723
Damn,
that was fast.

181
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,241
We're in Timeline 23.

182
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,147
Act out.

183
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,666
This doesn't make sense.

184
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:30,659
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

185
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,979
It just decided to send us back here?

186
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:34,446
What even are the rules?

187
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,924
Beats me...
they're weirdly inconsistent.

188
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:39,918
I guess we have some shit
to take care of in Timeline 23,

189
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,906
maybe key-related.

190
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,903
It worked!
They're here!

191
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,530
Marina?

192
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,224
Holy shit.

193
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,059
Wait, you know her?

194
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,650
Of course I do,
she was a year ahead of me,

195
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,322
and hot, um...

196
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,474
Okay,
I know you by reputation,

197
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,336
but how do you know me?

198
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,150
I don't know you here?

199
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,372
No.

200
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:06,188
You went to Brakebills,

201
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,204
I'm a hedge witch,
we don't mix.

202
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,372
So, what happened
in your timeline?

203
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,448
Um, I didn't go to Brakebills,

204
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,831
so we became friends.

205
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,246
Friends?

206
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,313
That does not sound like me.

207
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,878
Wait, you didn't go to Brakebills?

208
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,695
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

209
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:25,493
Alternate timeline shit is weird.

210
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:26,566
Tell me about it.

211
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,082
Why don't we go somewhere safer?
We can talk about all this.

212
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:35,232
Jesus, place hasn't looked this
partied out since my first year.

213
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,769
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

214
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,377
No clue, how about in yours?

215
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,652
A God was killed by a human.

216
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,417
The Old Gods took it away as punishment.

217
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,767
Bunch of Mount Olympus-sized dicks.

218
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,433
And magic going out here was the
beginning of the end for us.

219
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,236
That Beast started killing Magicians...

220
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,128
first Brakebills,
then the hedge witches.

221
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,142
So, we joined forces to survive.

222
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:58,473
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

223
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,148
is Brakebills really the safest
place for us to hang out?

224
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,271
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

225
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,755
Thinks everyone's dead.

226
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,915
We have scoured
what's left of the place

227
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,538
looking for away to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

228
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,215
That's how
we found the Tesla Flexion,

229
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,608
and a battery to cast it.

230
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,217
And this sweet jacket.

231
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,720
It's not magic,
but might as well be.

232
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:20,841
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

233
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,421
Julia can...

234
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:25,039
Uh, tell you about it herself.

235
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,190
And it's not even...
it's not even big news.

236
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,639
I don't know why I said that...

237
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:31,306
Your Beast has some sort of key?

238
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,569
Mm-hmm.

239
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:34,598
We need it.

240
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:36,904
You help us kill our Beast,

241
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,169
key is yours.

242
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,515
Deal.

243
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:41,657
Boom.

244
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,411
Let's celebrate, bitches...

245
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,294
Powerful women.

246
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,947
So, Marina, huh?

247
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:50,228
You know,
I've always had a crush on her.

248
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:51,539
I know.

249
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,545
Oh, right...

250
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,770
Hey, what happened to
the glasses?

251
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,094
Lasik.

252
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:00,193
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

253
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,686
You are the braver Josh.

254
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,433
I've been through some shit.

255
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,697
Tell.

256
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:09,073
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

257
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,286
- I ended up stuck...
- Stuck in the Neitherlands, me too.

258
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,676
If the Physical Kids hadn't shown
up, I don't know how long...

259
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,422
No one ever showed up for me.

260
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,186
No one made it out?

261
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:21,657
Some made it out,
they just forgot about me.

262
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:23,506
Dude.

263
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:26,123
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

264
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:29,398
I'd be a lone wolf...
brave, heroic, solo.

265
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,417
Got Lasik, found this sweet jacket,
and changed my fucking life.

266
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,759
Wow.

267
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:36,694
Is this like that time when we got
that Kangol hat in middle school

268
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,419
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

269
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,575
No, it's not like that at all.

270
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,014
Cool.

271
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,364
Inspiring.

272
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:44,873
And, uh...

273
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,005
Phew.

274
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,441
Did you...

275
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,777
Did you just roofie me?

276
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,967
Nighty-night.

277
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,377
Oh, ugh.

278
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,924
What happened?

279
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,496
What the hell are
we tied up with?

280
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,053
It was Professor Sunderland's.

281
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:12,078
Wish I took more classes
with her.

282
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,214
Why are we all tied up?

283
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:17,012
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

284
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,602
until now.

285
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:19,969
We're gonna give you to him.

286
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,737
This is insane.

287
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,511
You can't trust The Beast.

288
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,005
What makes you think he'll make
a deal instead of killing you?

289
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,313
You.

290
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:30,779
When he showed up here with
his key killing everybody,

291
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:32,760
he kept asking for you.

292
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,890
I don't understand, I
thought I was dead here.

293
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,606
You are, it was actually
pretty confusing.

294
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,418
So, maybe the guy with
the face full of moths

295
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,616
isn't in the best place
psychologically.

296
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,889
But it gave me an idea.

297
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,265
Give The Beast what he wants...

298
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:48,964
Julia, from an alternate timeline
in exchange for leaving us alone.

299
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,340
And what about me?

300
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,571
Sorry, bro.

301
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:53,534
You're the Cedric Diggory of this story.

302
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,559
At least he died looking hot.

303
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:59,039
The Beast should be here soon.
He can sense magic.

304
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,310
There's no way he'd miss
that Tesla Flexion.

305
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:03,250
You have another choice.

306
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,180
In our timeline,

307
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:07,421
we killed The Beast
using a spell...

308
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:08,733
the Rhinemann Ultra.

309
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,046
Yeah,
I've heard of that.

310
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,389
Don't you need
God-level power to cast it?

311
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,579
Yeah,
you do.

312
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:44,423
Also took care of your migraines,

313
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,605
and smoking addiction... you're welcome.

314
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,322
- How did you...
- Long story.

315
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,955
Act out.

316
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,364
Easy, cowboy.

317
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,712
I promise you, it's real.

318
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,957
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

319
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:58,968
So, what do you say?

320
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,815
You have this
Rhinemann spell?

321
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:07,279
Dean Fogg will know where to
find it, if he's still alive.

322
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:08,811
Oh, he's still alive...

323
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,385
not exactly the premier
educator he once was.

324
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,613
Kind of a walking opioid crisis.

325
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,979
I'll, uh, take you to him.

326
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:20,577
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

327
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,033
Enjoy swapping puberty stories.

328
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,655
They're the same stories.

329
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,425
<i>So, you and Dean Fogg
are on good terms here?</i>

330
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,175
I mean, he did kick
me out of Brakebills,

331
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:36,128
but he's warmed to me
a bit since then.

332
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,404
Nothing like watching
all of your students and friends

333
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:41,260
get murdered by a creature from
another world to open you up.

334
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,549
How do you know him? I thought
you didn't go to Brakebills.

335
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:46,304
It's complicated.

336
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,196
- You fucked him.
- No! What?

337
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:51,096
Okay,
defensive much?

338
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:53,071
He's not that bad in bed...

339
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:54,460
Okay...

340
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,681
Hey, speaking of,

341
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,297
what's the deal with
you and me in your timeline?

342
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,433
I'm sensing some weird kinda tension.

343
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:04,936
- Is it the fun kind?
- Like I said, we were friends.

344
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,083
It wasn't always fun.

345
00:14:08,202 --> 00:14:09,393
We got into a big fight,

346
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:13,081
but we ended up kinda getting over it.

347
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,510
That's it?

348
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,578
From your face, I was expecting
something a little more...

349
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,246
dramatic.

350
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,630
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

351
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,127
This way?

352
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:37,517
Marina.

353
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,582
Aww, come on.

354
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,262
I won't steal anything
from you this time.

355
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,299
What did you steal from me last time?

356
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,938
Nothing, just forget I said anything.

357
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:55,807
Just... I found an
old student of yours, okay?

358
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,708
Come in.

359
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,883
Timeline 40?

360
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:32,994
I have to live through
another 17 more of these.

361
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,194
Uh, you don't
remember them all?

362
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:37,135
Only the ones
I've been through already.

363
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,691
I thought 22 was
absolutely dreadful,

364
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,112
until this one.

365
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,593
Is that really necessary?

366
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,264
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

367
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,335
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

368
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,848
No, it doesn't.

369
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,337
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

370
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,767
Ah, yes, the Rhinemann Ultra.

371
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,801
My friend Bigby had that.

372
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,066
Unfortunately, she's dead.

373
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:07,380
Everything went to shit when magic died.

374
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:09,451
Creatures got set upon,

375
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,065
chopped up to steal their mojo.

376
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,574
That poor thing.

377
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,373
I killed a leprechaun once.

378
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,989
I'm not proud.

379
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:23,994
Just saying.

380
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,669
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

381
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:30,539
You wouldn't happen to know
where Bigby kept it? The spell?

382
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:31,905
I don't.

383
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:34,578
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

384
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,705
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

385
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,745
but... I sent two students
to see her.

386
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,430
They died.

387
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,219
Seems to be
a bit of a theme.

388
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,539
There's good news.

389
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,511
You see, their deaths were,

390
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,843
well, earth-shatteringly horrible.
I mean, really awful...

391
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,397
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

392
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:57,899
Wait, so how is this good news?

393
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:00,839
Because they're ghosts, dear.

394
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:03,524
They still haunt the library,
last I checked...

395
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,115
pretty deep in the stacks.

396
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,220
They might remember the spell.

397
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:11,319
But... I'd be careful
if I were you.

398
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,481
Ghosts, well,
ghosts can be dangerous.

399
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

400
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,820
<i>How could you do this to me,
man?</i>

401
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:23,259
You're me, I'm you, we're us.

402
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,916
I would never betray myself.

403
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,530
You haven't been through
what I've been through.

404
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:28,871
Yes I have, except the Lasik.

405
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,069
There's more than that.

406
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:31,252
Whatever.

407
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:32,786
You know,
I thought you were cool

408
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,366
and brave.

409
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,680
And I dug your jacket, but now
I just think you're a dick,

410
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,010
which sucks,
because that means I'm a dick.

411
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,581
What do you expect?

412
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:43,383
My friends abandoned me.

413
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:45,254
Maybe they were right too.

414
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:47,049
What, did you
roofie and betray them too?

415
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:48,297
No.

416
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,092
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

417
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:51,807
How do you know what you're gonna do?

418
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:53,116
The Quickening?

419
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,945
What's The Quickening?

420
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:57,776
I can't think about it. I don'
want all their blood on my hands.

421
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,679
What the hell is The Quickening?

422
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,295
Nothing you need to worry about.

423
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:02,869
Just be glad you didn't bang a werewolf.

424
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,813
Let's talk about something else, okay?
Now I need an aspirin.

425
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:11,890
<i>[EERIE MUSIC]</i>

426
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,638
Yeah, the library got ransacked

427
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,111
after The Beast took out
most of the school.

428
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,320
Honestly,
I did most of the ransacking,

429
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,949
but I didn't see
any ghosts.

430
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:27,702
Eliot, holy shit!

431
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,958
Oh, what the hell was that?

432
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,996
I think I know
the students who died here.

433
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:35,313
- Eliot and...
- <i>Margo?</i>

434
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:41,383
I told you we need to
get our shit together, Eliot.

435
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,259
I have my shit together.

436
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:47,476
No, you're holding
your shit together, barely.

437
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,240
There's a difference.

438
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,712
Don't let that pixie twat
Bigby get in your head.

439
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,668
She called me a lush,

440
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,900
which is basically just
a nice way of saying alcoholic.

441
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,792
And she said
I couldn't handle the spell.

442
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,707
Why don't you prove her wrong
and help me, okay?

443
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:05,194
What are we doing?

444
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:08,431
Well, before we can do the
Rhinemann, we need a power-up.

445
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,806
Here is a cooperative spell.

446
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,910
Now, if we can cast this
together,

447
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,673
it might just give us
enough juice to kill The Beast.

448
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,422
And if we cast it wrong,

449
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,463
kaboom.

450
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:22,028
So, let's not cast it wrong.

451
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:26,819
- What if Bigby was right?
- What if I am too drunk?

452
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,497
What if I screw it up?

453
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:31,301
Ack!

454
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:34,360
You are not gonna
cock out on me.

455
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:35,514
Cock out?

456
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,125
I'd say pussy,
but let's be honest.

457
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,961
Which one is tougher?

458
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,528
Point made.

459
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,734
Oh God, oh God...

460
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:01,629
I screwed up, I screwed up,
I screwed up, I screwed...

461
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:04,428
ah, ah, ah, ah...

462
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:08,601
Ugh... Oh!

463
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,670
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up, I screwed it up,

464
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:15,028
I screwed it up, I screwed it up,
I screwed it up,

465
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,112
I screwed it up,

466
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,531
I screwed it up...

467
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:19,745
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up...

468
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,036
Bambi?

469
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,247
Where's my Bambi?

470
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,718
Where's my Bambi?

471
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,906
- Come on... oh!
- Jesus Christ!

472
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,004
Cocks.

473
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:40,827
- Ugh, yuck, that was...
- So yuck.

474
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,727
Not fun at all.

475
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:44,475
Please tell me
you got that spell.

476
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,801
Yeah, I, uh,
I think I can make it out.

477
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:50,137
I think
someone is following us.

478
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:56,234
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

479
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:57,503
Okay.

480
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,145
- Now!
- That's your signal?

481
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:07,661
Penny?

482
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,457
Julia.

483
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:13,423
So, it is you.

484
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,183
You're real.

485
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,043
You're alive.

486
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:27,000
Whoa, um, um...

487
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,808
Julia, it's me.

488
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:31,271
- Yeah, I... I know.
- God, it's like I'm...

489
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:34,465
- I'm living in a dream.
- Just let me short-circuit this.

490
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,333
If you think
following two strangers

491
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:39,037
and then kissing one of them
is dream behavior...

492
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,432
She's not a stranger.

493
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:41,712
She's my soul mate.

494
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,078
Oh, God.

495
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,571
Um, I'm...

496
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:48,750
I'm actually not your Julia.

497
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,914
You see,
I'm from a different timeline.

498
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,743
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

499
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,425
I'm sorry, I thought-

500
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,114
- No, it's... it's okay.

501
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,495
When I heard a rumor that The
Beast was looking for her

502
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,045
even though she's dead, I...

503
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:06,634
it's crazy, but I...

504
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:08,842
I had to see.

505
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:11,404
I'm sorry.

506
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:12,627
It was stupid.

507
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:14,088
Julia, we gotta
get out of here.

508
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:16,208
- Where are you going?
- To kill The Beast.

509
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,543
- Let me come with you.
- Okay, sorry, buddy,

510
00:22:18,614 --> 00:22:20,292
but we got everything we need,
no baggage necessary.

511
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,103
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

512
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:25,924
He's a traveler,
could come in handy.

513
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:29,786
Eye roll.

514
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,075
It's working, I can feel it.

515
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,946
It's just a lot of moving pieces.

516
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:50,705
So...

517
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:55,130
what's up with me
in your timeline?

518
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:56,647
Well,

519
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,073
you're kind of in the Underworld.

520
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,377
Not good.

521
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:06,098
I'm not sure
you're technically dead.

522
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:08,240
So, in the Underworld,
but not dead?

523
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,662
That... sounds worse.

524
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,140
Truth is,

525
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:15,809
you got there because
you did something heroic.

526
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,092
Unlike my alternate self,
who's a dick,

527
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:21,991
possibly related to
self-esteem issues,

528
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,415
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

529
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:28,053
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

530
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:30,802
Here he comes.

531
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:35,309
Hey, can I ask you one last time...

532
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:36,578
what is The Quickening?

533
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,273
No, you can't.

534
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:40,204
I don't wanna talk about
my private tragedy,

535
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:44,033
- so unless you want me to gag you...
- Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

536
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:45,393
Don't call me Dick Josh.

537
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,457
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

538
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,087
I am not a dick.
I've had harder life than you.

539
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:52,367
Did you?
What makes you so sure?

540
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:54,724
Because
you get to hang out with Julia,

541
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:56,047
who is awesome,

542
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,138
and I get Marina,
who is mean all the time.

543
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:02,764
Then why do you hang out
with her?

544
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:06,588
Because when she dies,
it's not going to feel so bad.

545
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:09,085
Truth is,
maybe my friends abandoned me,

546
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,109
or maybe, I pushed them away.

547
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,620
Because whatever
this thing is that's looming...

548
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:16,877
because... unlike me,

549
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,000
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

550
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,624
Don't call me Dick Josh again.

551
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,427
Wow.

552
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:52,012
Oh shit, we got company!

553
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:56,244
I hope you're ready.

554
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,175
Josh, go!

555
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:05,176
A Josh has to live
to tell our story.

556
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:11,934
Get back! Anything inside
of 20 feet will be ash!

557
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,300
Julia.

558
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,192
The key didn't lie.

559
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:24,547
Q?

560
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,235
Getting a little sick of
plot twists.

561
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,745
Focus, we need to get
out of here.

562
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:29,595
I can travel, but I can't
take anyone with me

563
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,289
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

564
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:32,574
Let me try.

565
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:46,472
<i>Quentin is The Beast.</i>

566
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:49,308
Quentin is The Beast?

567
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,358
How the fuck is Quentin The Beast?

568
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:53,861
Who's Quentin again?

569
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:56,260
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

570
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:58,867
to run away to Fillory in the
first place and get murdered.

571
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,337
Yeah, by The Beast.

572
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:04,174
So, you see
why this is confusing?

573
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:07,544
Doesn't make any sense.

574
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:10,991
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

575
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:14,423
She said that he tore out his
Shade, and destroyed him.

576
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:17,450
Uh, did he look destroyed
to any of you?

577
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:19,923
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

578
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,534
I didn't even think
that was possible.

579
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:24,231
You'd have to have a lot of power,
like a God.

580
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,594
Oh, we are in such deep shit.

581
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:30,336
Maybe we should just stay here
in this branch of the library.

582
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,292
Hey Penny,
where are all the Librarians?

583
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,609
I don't know.

584
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:36,767
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

585
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,917
It's the first place I found
where I couldn't hear The Beast.

586
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:40,720
Now, is that The Beast beast,

587
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:44,184
or the Q beast,
or is there another beast?

588
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,354
I think we're missing
some pages of the story here

589
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,572
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

590
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,931
and Quentin is The Beast,
only more powerful.

591
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,085
I know who
we should talk to...

592
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,793
the one person who tried
to bring Quentin back.

593
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:01,178
Do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

594
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,089
Um...

595
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:10,003
is there an Alice Quinn on this boat?

596
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:11,569
Other cabin.

597
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,319
Thanks.

598
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,649
I was going to
give up on Quentin.

599
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,270
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

600
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:22,599
and I couldn't reach it

601
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:25,059
until your
Tesla Flexion came through.

602
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,181
That changed everything.

603
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,811
Seeing him and hearing
that he loved me...

604
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,564
just knowing that he was out there,
if only I could bring him back.

605
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:37,742
So, what did you do?

606
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:40,267
There's a creature in the Northern Marsh

607
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:43,415
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

608
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:47,278
What kind of evil creature-type
deal are we talking here?

609
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,591
When I die,
I won't go to the Underworld.

610
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,880
Now, I belong to him.

611
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,516
So, Harvey Weinstein-type evil.

612
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,235
So, um,
what did he give you?

613
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:02,509
The power to bring
Quentin back without his Shade.

614
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,965
I was so heartbroken, I thought
that maybe we could just

615
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,252
fix it together once he returned.

616
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:11,001
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

617
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,268
Without his Shade, he...

618
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:17,192
- He wasn't Quentin.
- No.

619
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,079
He wanted Fillory for himself.

620
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,851
So, he killed The Beast.

621
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:25,486
But that wasn't enough.

622
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,990
So, he found a way to kill Ember,
and steal his powers.

623
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,225
But because he killed a God...

624
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:33,582
The Old Gods took
magic away.

625
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,368
Quentin still had the power
he stole from Ember.

626
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:42,454
He told me that Fillory was the
only thing that he truly loved.

627
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:45,405
It was always his escape.

628
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,453
He was afraid of magic,

629
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:51,119
of any Magician
who might bring it back.

630
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,340
Anyone who would
oppose him,

631
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,868
take Fillory from him...

632
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:59,553
And the six fingers, moths...

633
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,221
how'd that shit happen?

634
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:02,861
I don't know.

635
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,403
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

636
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:11,303
that he was the only one who
appreciated Fillory like he did.

637
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:13,330
I'm sorry.

638
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:17,231
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I just... I loved Quentin.

639
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,344
And I wanted to see him
again.

640
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,425
It's okay.

641
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:24,039
Hell no, it's not okay.

642
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,780
All of our friends died
because of you,

643
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:29,055
because of what you did.

644
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:31,420
Because of what I did.

645
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:34,892
Quentin and I used the Tesla Flexion

646
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:36,520
to talk to her.

647
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:39,813
And if we hadn't,
Alice never would've tried

648
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:41,463
to bring her Quentin back,

649
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,270
and none of this
would've happened.

650
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,658
Whoa, whoa,
time travel headache.

651
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:48,184
Okay, so, what, just
because you gave her the sads,

652
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,563
it's somehow your fault that
she resurrected a crazy monster

653
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:52,975
who murdered everybody and got
magic turned off? I mean, yeah,

654
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:55,045
I guess it's kind of
a little bit your fault,

655
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:57,331
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

656
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,990
So, why you on this ship
anyway?

657
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,352
What is with all the bunnies?

658
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:03,748
Are you trying to send
a bunch of messages or something?

659
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:06,117
No, I work for them.

660
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:08,556
They're radish smugglers, I...

661
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,245
I stack boxes.
It's the only thing they can't do.

662
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:16,447
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

663
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,532
so I can try to fix my mistake.

664
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:19,798
How?

665
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:22,420
By finding a weapon to kill Quentin.

666
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,696
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

667
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,114
I found this.

668
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:40,888
Don't ask me how.

669
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,824
Let me guess...
you traveled to the past

670
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:50,728
and made a deal with a knife maker?

671
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:56,692
The only problem is,

672
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,206
I don't have enough power to touch it.

673
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,010
I do.

674
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,064
I'll tell Captain Hopps
I'm leaving.

675
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:30,796
Found some carrot wine.

676
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:35,404
The other Josh

677
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:38,653
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

678
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:41,617
Something did... he fucking died.

679
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:44,166
Yeah, but...

680
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,646
It's gonna happen
to me too.

681
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:49,294
Whatever the holy hell
was gonna happen to him

682
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:52,193
that he never goddamn told me
because I never got past the part,

683
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:54,272
it's called The Quickening,

684
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:56,560
'cause that's not ominous.

685
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:01,486
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

686
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,570
That's what
I always heard too.

687
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,485
Turns out,
it's murder herpes.

688
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:10,584
So, yay.

689
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:14,691
If I find out I may turn into
a monster and kill everyone,

690
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:17,187
I'd run far away.

691
00:32:19,347 --> 00:32:21,690
'Cause if you're near Julia
when that happens,

692
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,518
I'll kill you myself, Dick Josh.

693
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,476
- We can't do that.
- But it totally works.

694
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:39,433
We pop in,
we throw Alice to The Beast,

695
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:41,074
and when he's munching
on her entrails,

696
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,421
Penny pops you behind and
you stab Q-bert in the back.

697
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,774
Marina, I'm not going
to use Alice as bait.

698
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:48,810
Why not? I mean, you heard her.
This is all her fault,

699
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,737
she wants to fix
what she screwed up.

700
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,196
There are ways to do this without
sacrificing her life, okay?

701
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,994
Are you getting cold feet because The
Beast is your former best friend,

702
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:00,542
the... unimpressive white guy?

703
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:02,093
No, it's not that.

704
00:33:02,162 --> 00:33:03,919
Because people have already
died in this timeline.

705
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:05,355
Basically, everyone I know...

706
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:09,201
they're dead because of short,
blonde, and crazy, and I guess you.

707
00:33:09,495 --> 00:33:12,506
But why would you give a shit about
that? You just want your stupid key.

708
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:23,699
I tried to kill a God once
with help from a friend...

709
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:25,924
you.

710
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,905
I used you as bait to lure him.

711
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:33,625
And when I couldn't get back
in time, he killed you.

712
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,501
I screwed up, and you died.

713
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:41,028
And it was horrible.

714
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,159
Jesus Christ.

715
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,620
I'm so sorry.

716
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:46,883
I couldn't tell you before because

717
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,498
it was my fault.

718
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,486
And I can never do that
to someone again.

719
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,153
So, what do you wanna do?
I mean, this shit is dangerous.

720
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,441
We can't just waltz up
on The Beast.

721
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,548
He may act like a beast, but,

722
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,733
deep down, he's the Quentin
I've always known.

723
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:15,051
So, what are you saying?
You wanna spare him?

724
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,873
I wanna use that against him.

725
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,729
Uh, wow.

726
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:38,186
He... really let the place go.

727
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:39,989
What is all this shit?

728
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,114
The Winter's Doe...

729
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,556
what's... left of her.

730
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,805
Jesus, did he eat her?

731
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:56,626
These are the polished rocks
from the Silver Banks.

732
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:59,685
That's where Martin Chatwin
learned to skip rocks.

733
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:04,682
This is a bugle from Brass City.

734
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:08,050
Rupert learned to play on this.

735
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,799
- You guys, this isn't trash.
- No.

736
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:15,591
This is a "Fillory and
Further" fan boy's collection.

737
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:17,354
It's trash.

738
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:19,699
Quentin's been hoarding this.

739
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,758
You're not a very good player,

740
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:40,117
whoever you are.

741
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,697
Hilarious.

742
00:35:55,549 --> 00:35:56,977
Alice?

743
00:35:58,335 --> 00:36:00,400
I can smell you.

744
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:02,987
Why don't you come on out?

745
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,346
He knows I'm here.

746
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:06,073
Hurry, quick, let's go.

747
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:07,320
I'm trying.

748
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:11,610
Shit, he must've cast a ward.
I can't travel into the throne room.

749
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:15,870
Fine, you don't wanna come out?

750
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,506
Then I will...

751
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:20,692
fill the room with fire.

752
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,989
You guys stay,
I'll go.

753
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,286
- No, Alice, don't.
- I have to.

754
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,726
If I don't, he'll kill all of us.

755
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:38,984
I'm here, Quentin.

756
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,057
Wait.

757
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:45,876
I am the only one
who can stop him.

758
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,693
I made a mistake.

759
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:00,566
- I should never have run from you.
- That's what I said.

760
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,676
You killed every
Magician you could find,

761
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,907
except me.

762
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,439
Why?

763
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:11,352
I thought about it,
but you were doing

764
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,782
such a good job of
torturing yourself.

765
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,538
And the others, I...

766
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:21,814
I could say that they were a threat,
but honestly, I just realized

767
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:24,223
that I didn't like them
very much.

768
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:26,716
Doesn't sound like you.

769
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,107
I know you.

770
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:31,784
You knew me.

771
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:35,440
You're not Martin Chatwin, you're
not The Beast... you hate The Beast.

772
00:37:35,594 --> 00:37:36,894
True.

773
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:42,093
But you show up with a face full of moths,
and everyone loses their shit.

774
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:48,703
People think that
The Beast

775
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,988
is invincible.

776
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,797
Who wouldn't use that
to their advantage?

777
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:03,047
I think that he would be flattered

778
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:07,179
I did a Dread Pirate Roberts.

779
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,206
"The Princess Bride."

780
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:13,065
Please, Quentin.

781
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,609
I know the man that I love
is still inside you somewhere.

782
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:18,414
Yeah, I ate him.

783
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,092
Okay, this is obviously

784
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,972
a ploy to buy your friends time,

785
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,644
so why don't we just get
this over with?

786
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,961
That's a familiar scent.

787
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:41,404
Julia.

788
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:46,616
You can't kill me, you've already tried.

789
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:57,441
What did you...

790
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,356
what did you do to me?

791
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:00,574
It's my Shade.

792
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:02,511
And I can live without it
if I have to.

793
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,246
Everything that you are
feeling right now,

794
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:09,467
I have felt...
grief, sadness, shame, regret.

795
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,282
Q?

796
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:15,687
Alice.

797
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,232
I killed her.

798
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,976
I'm so sorry.

799
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,868
Q?

800
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:33,578
Where did you find the key?

801
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,488
Um...

802
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:40,072
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

803
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,582
and I couldn't have that,
so I got it first.

804
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:47,394
I know why you were looking for me.
The key...

805
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,223
it showed you visions of the future...

806
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,631
me killing you.

807
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:54,411
Julia...

808
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,198
I'm here to tell you I'm not.

809
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:59,398
I'm not going to kill you.

810
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,862
I wanna help you.

811
00:40:02,622 --> 00:40:05,216
The visions weren't of you
killing me.

812
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:09,760
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

813
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:15,004
You were trying to let magic in, but
you let in something much worse.

814
00:40:15,524 --> 00:40:16,830
What?

815
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,874
A monster.

816
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:23,933
One even worse than me.

817
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,311
You should take your Shade back.

818
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:04,444
You look dumb.

819
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:08,692
I'm trying to get this
stupid key to open up a door.

820
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:12,244
Well, isn't there, like, some
kind of ritual for that? Or...

821
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:13,555
It would be nice

822
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:17,679
if there was, but no,
so, key-waving.

823
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,785
Is that my Josh's jacket?

824
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,048
Yeah.

825
00:41:22,117 --> 00:41:24,662
Hm, you look cooler.

826
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,260
You are mean.

827
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:36,706
So, the key show you anything?

828
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,082
Visions of the future?

829
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:40,791
Nothing.

830
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,157
Okay.

831
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:44,977
Then I guess you don't know
that I'm coming with you.

832
00:41:45,564 --> 00:41:46,504
What?

833
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,417
Your Penny's dead, or,

834
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,627
not alive in some
confusing way.

835
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,836
- Penny, I don't...
- I'm not asking permission.

836
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:57,737
Okay.

837
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:01,343
I'm not her.

838
00:42:01,523 --> 00:42:02,983
I know that.

839
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:06,156
It's just,
there's nothing here for me.

840
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:07,487
But there?

841
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:09,849
Give it time.

842
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:13,676
Hey, uh, Jules?

843
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:15,385
We have a door.

844
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:21,995
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

845
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:23,962
I honestly don't know.
