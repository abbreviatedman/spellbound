5

6

This book is more withholding

49
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,013
Right, so the first quest

50
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,449
is in Fillory.

51
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,486
Eliot's taking point.

52
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,897
Yeah, but we should
be there with him.

53
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,041
JOSH: Hell, yeah, we should.

54
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,058
Quests are not a solo op,

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,060
and thanks to Dean Fogg and
the world's biggest FedEx bill,

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,493
we've got the clock.

57
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,254
So all we need is magic.

58
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,762
Which is where
you come in, right?

59
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,029
Wrong. I mean, that
would be like trying

60
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,333
to power a Ferrari
on a drop of unleaded.

61
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,873
So we power this puppy how?

62
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,501
Mayakovsky. Yes.

63
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,687
Can I focus on something I
don't wanna punch in the face?

64
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,821
He had four batteries
in Brakebills South.

65
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,404
He said that's
all he had, but...

66
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,177
He's a lying drunk, so
of course he had more.

67
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,182
And he's been MIA since
magic got shut down.

68
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,222
And if he's roaming the
earth, he's using them.

69
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,187
If only to scam chicks.

70
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,520
Any ideas where?

71
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,718
No.

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,754
I mean, magic
might be dead, but...

73
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,395
Google isn't.

74
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,498

75
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,264

We can't even control the
gold-shitting beetles anymore,

81

declared themselves free

82

180
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,950
It kinda gave me hope.

181
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,178
Yeah.

182
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,055
Do you remember what
happened right before?

183
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,021
Yeah, you could
smell it first, then feel it.

184
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,422
I mean, everyone in here could.

185
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,169
You know, it's like, you're
starving for two months

186
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,321
and all of a sudden, steak's
on the grill, you know?

187
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,921
The whole room started buzzing

188
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,932
and everyone zeroed in
on this drunk Russian guy

189
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,076
and the girl he came in with.

190
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
QUENTIN: Uh, is...

191
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,225
Was that, um...

192
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,804
Was that the guy? DONOVAN: Yeah.

193
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,202
Jeez, that guy's a prick.

194
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,797
JULIA: Wait, I'm sorry,

195
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,151
are you saying
that it's possible

196
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,973
he turned himself into a bear?

197
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,875
You know what? That
guy was so wasted.

198
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,323
I don't think he knew
what he was doing.

199
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,557
And the girl was
trying to control him,

200
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,913
but she wasn't exactly sober,

201
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,815
so it was a lot at once.

202
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,580
Anything else you can remember?

203
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,384
She was way too
young for that guy.

204
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,290
Wait, was that
her? Is that the girl?

205
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,554
Yeah, that's her. Yep.

206
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,192
All right, hey, I should
probably see her alone.

207
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,099
Well... Emily, even at her best,

208
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,547
which she's probably
not right now, is a little...

209
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,096

'Course, I've been
drunk for about a week...

217
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,291
So there's that. Do
you want a beer?

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,128
Oh... You do.

You want one. Come on.

So, how did you guys
end up at that bar?

Oh, good story.

222
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,306
Well, last week,
Mischa just showed up

223
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,347
at my door... Very dramatic,

224
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,940
telling me how he was
free of the bond, he said,

225
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,849
and that he'd always loved me

226
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,515
and he always would.

227
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,957
Oh.

228
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,424
Well, that's great. Yeah!

229
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,019
So after, you know, a
couple hours in bed...

230
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,358
Just, like...

231
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,432
We decided to celebrate.

232
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,230

some kind of room.

234
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,368
Maybe it was an Uber. Anyway.

235
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,374

how bad it was before,

240
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,233
he felt like he had to
prove his love, you know?

Something to.

I don't know. Honestly.

256
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,390
It was a woman.

heard all this screaming.

Next thing, he is... He is...

260
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,239
He's hulking out of his clothes,

261
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,401
and he's getting all hairy.

262
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,978

full bear, and he's...

it was that woman that...

00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,596
What happened?

723
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,364
You're not as
quick as your friend.

724
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,472
She took it.

726
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,001
Kady.

727
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,954
She's the only one
who hits that hard.

728
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,489
Wait, you had the
battery the whole time?

729
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,513
Of course I did.

730
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,638
So, wait, so,

731
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,445
you turned Mayakovsky
into a bear? Mmm-hmm.

732
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,644
Isn't he your husband?

733
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,618
Which is the only
reason I didn't kill him.

734

00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,456

I've seen the wounds
the shadow bat makes.

750
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,303
The fangs are serrated.

751
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,236
The wounds are messy.

752
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,807

I'm telling you

a blade killed the villager.

757
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,823
Okay, so I'll go to Brakebills.

where she works,

759
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,892
and Josh, you wanna
take her apartment?

760
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,024
Look, I just need to know
the action plan, okay?

761
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,264
If I do find her, do I,
what, just grab the battery?

762
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,501
Even if she's using it
at that exact moment

763
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,631
to save Penny?

764
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,903
And even if saving Penny
means the battery's dead?

765
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,720
Or the battery has
enough juice to save Penny

766
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,664
and help us, she just
doesn't want me to have it.

767
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,773

get, from her perspective.

Only I'm not her, I'm me,

769

fuckness that is the universe.

her, and then we'll
