1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,120
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,544
<i>As a Niffin, you made enemies.</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,496
One of them seeks you...
The Lamprey.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,630
You're down to
an early warning device.

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,709
- An alarm, if you will.
- What is that, a joke?

6
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,011
- Cancer.
- Call it cancer plus.

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,657
Every time
you leave this branch,

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,172
you go where
time moves normally,

9
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,473
and where time progresses...

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,095
So does my super cancer. I know.

11
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,473
I wanna do a spell. A cheat day.

12
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,356
I'm just putting it all
together.

13
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,183
Just tell me what you think,

14
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,485
and could you maybe try
a Russian accent?

15
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,734
Mayakovsky. That's a battery.

16
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,610
That holds magical current.

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,900
How many of those do you have?

18
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,194
- My people need help.
- They sure do.

19
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,782
I'll send you on an epic quest.

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,366
<i>The Tale of the Seven Keys.</i>

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,747
Jules, this is our quest.

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,912
And we're already on it.

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,259
<i>The Tale of the Seven Keys.</i>

24
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,420
<i>Chapter one.</i>

25
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,719
<i>"Long ago, in a far-off kingdom,"</i>

26
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,096
<i>"lived the daughter
of a brave knight."</i>

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,307
<i>"The knight
had always wanted a son"</i>

28
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,269
<i>"to whom he might
pass on his skills."</i>

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,902
<i>"So, while father and daughter
loved one another,"</i>

30
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,201
<i>"she often felt herself
a disappointment to him."</i>

31
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,449
<i>"One day, a witch
kidnapped the knight."</i>

32
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,417
<i>"The daughter pleaded
with her to return him."</i>

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,753
<i>"The witch said no,
but he could be rescued"</i>

34
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,590
<i>"if the girl could complete
a quest."</i>

35
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,309
<i>"There are seven keys, '
said the witch."</i>

36
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,430
<i>"Find them, and you can
open your father's prison..."</i>

37
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,357
<i>"The Castle
At The End of the World. '"</i>

38
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,527
<i>"The witch told the daughter
the first key was to be found"</i>

39
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,401
<i>"on an island
beyond her kingdom,"</i>

40
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,200
<i>"so she sailed
past the Outer Islands."</i>

41
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,828
<i>"And while the voyage
was treacherous,"</i>

42
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,621
<i>"her destination was more so,"</i>

43
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:10,454
"for nothing was as it seemed
on After Island."

44
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,546
Wow. Okay.

45
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:13,883
So, then...

46
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,551
Then...

47
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,476
Jesus.

48
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,540
This book is more withholding
than my last girlfriend.

49
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,806
Right, so the first quest

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,232
is in Fillory.

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,271
Eliot's taking point.

52
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,714
Yeah, but we should
be there with him.

53
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,819
Hell, yeah, we should.

54
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,863
Quests are not a solo op,

55
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,862
and thanks to Dean Fogg and the
world's biggest FedEx bill,

56
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,284
we've got the clock.

57
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,073
So all we need is magic.

58
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,573
Which is where you come in,
right?

59
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,829
Wrong. I mean,
that would be like trying

60
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,127
to power a Ferrari
on a drop of unleaded.

61
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,670
So we power this puppy how?

62
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,290
- Mayakovsky.
- Yes.

63
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,487
Can I focus on something I
don't wanna punch in the face?

64
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,613
He had four batteries
in Brakebills South.

65
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,219
He said
that's all he had, but...

66
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,968
He's a lying drunk,
so of course he had more.

67
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,968
And he's been MIA
since magic got shut down.

68
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,018
And if he's roaming the earth,
he's using them.

69
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,978
If only to scam chicks.

70
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,306
Any ideas where?

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,516
No.

72
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,560
I mean, magic might be dead,
but...

73
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,194
Google isn't.

74
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,272
So...

75
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,066
We're out of dough.

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,068
Moolah.

77
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,992
Chedda.

78
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,782
Money, people.

79
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,746
Magic's gone.

80
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,921
We can't even control the
gold-shitting beetles anymore,

81
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,588
and now they've
declared themselves free

82
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,836
and disappeared.

83
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,377
We're about to be
a third world country

84
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,132
on a planet with
two and a half countries.

85
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,680
Yes, which is why the
Council and I are wondering

86
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,883
why we're spending so much money

87
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,468
on a very old ship.

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,886
Thank you for asking,
Queen Margo.

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,275
The <i>Muntjac</i> is the fastest boat
in our ancient, leaky fleet,

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,568
and the best way
to reach the Outer Islands,

91
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,771
where taxes haven't
been collected in...

92
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,323
46 years, 3 months, and 7 days.

93
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,402
So let's just be clear here
about how government works.

94
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,663
We can't do anything
without money.

95
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,477
Now, if there are
any dissenting opinions

96
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,037
as to my royal order,

97
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,962
I will remind the Council
that this is not a democracy.

98
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,590
Truer words never spoken.

99
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,503
And this meeting

100
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,841
is to inform all assembled
here what I intend to do.

101
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,968
We'll see.

102
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,892
Me, either.

103
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,746
Guys?

104
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,540
Is that a hedge witch bar?

105
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,715
Caught my eye.

106
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,338
What... Where'd you find this?

107
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,545
YouTube. Urban Freakfest.

108
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,429
Was just posted.

109
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,558
<i>Stop it, Mischa, no!</i>

110
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,812
Okay, that's cool.

111
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,107
Point one,
Mayakovsky's first name...

112
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,105
- Mischa.
- Right.

113
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,652
The "Joe" of Russia.

114
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,651
Point two,
the symbol of Russia...

115
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,152
A brown bear.

116
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,820
Point three... Recognize that?

117
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,412
Yeah, that does kinda
look like...

118
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,990
Yep. And point four...

119
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,541
That bear is a dick.

120
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,338
<i>Da.</i>

121
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,928
How old is this one?

122
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,006
Moses is eight months.

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,182
That's too old.

124
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,139
What about...

125
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,970
First, I... Need to know

126
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,681
whether you have
fully accepted Jesus

127
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,475
as your savior.

128
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,980
Pardon?

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,816
What about this one?

130
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,531
Hester is five months.

131
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,028
I'll take her.

132
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,409
I do need you to swear to me

133
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,494
that you'll protect this animal,

134
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,542
and Hester shall see no evil.

135
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,220
So, wait, Mayakovsky

136
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,095
uses the last drops of magic
anywhere for a bar trick?

137
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,926
Or maybe someone did it to him.

138
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,057
Or the bear
could just be a bear.

139
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,139
Look, do you recognize
this place?

140
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,935
You said you had
something else to show me?

141
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,792
Wait... How?

142
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,710
I don't know,
but it's all I can do,

143
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,149
which is almost worse
than nothing at all.

144
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,631
But if Mayakovsky
was in New York City

145
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,820
with a battery big enough
to turn himself into a bear,

146
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,005
maybe there are more.

147
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,156
And if Julia could get her hands

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,546
on one of those batteries...

149
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,973
Then maybe we could help Penny.

150
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,638
That is a hedge bar.

151
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,970
I was 86-ed, so just get us in.

152
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,057
Yeah, well, recent history doesn't
do much for your credibility

153
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,937
when it comes to you, me,
and a plan.

154
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,810
- How sick is Penny?
- Fuck you.

155
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,443
Look, if Penny
doesn't need magic, go.

156
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,157
D. Hey.

157
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,787
Hey.

158
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,167
It's good to see you, K.

159
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,998
Yeah, you too.

160
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,792
So, the bear?

161
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,339
Yeah, that was weird. I mean...

162
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,046
I've seen weirder, but

163
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,676
not in a while.

164
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,766
It kinda gave me hope.

165
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,967
Yeah.

166
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,852
Do you remember
what happened right before?

167
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,804
Yeah, you could smell
it first, then feel it.

168
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,230
I mean, everyone in here could.

169
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,961
You know, it's like,
you're starving for two months

170
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,102
and all of a sudden,
steak's on the grill, you know?

171
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,731
The whole room started buzzing

172
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,734
and everyone zeroed in
on this drunk Russian guy

173
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,884
and the girl he came in with.

174
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,908
Uh, is...

175
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,029
Was that, um...

176
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,610
- Was that the guy?
- Yeah.

177
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,990
Jeez, that guy's a prick.

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,616
Wait, I'm sorry,

179
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,934
are you saying
that it's possible

180
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,790
he turned himself into a bear?

181
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,664
You know what?
That guy was so wasted.

182
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,106
I don't think he knew
what he was doing.

183
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,357
And the girl was
trying to control him,

184
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,713
but she wasn't exactly sober,

185
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,631
so it was a lot at once.

186
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,380
Anything else you can remember?

187
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,178
She was way too young
for that guy.

188
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,098
Wait, was that her?
Is that the girl?

189
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,346
Yeah, that's her. Yep.

190
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,972
All right, hey, I should
probably see her alone.

191
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,896
Well... Emily, even at her best,

192
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,338
which she's probably
not right now, is a little...

193
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,898
Crazy?

194
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,025
Vulnerable.

195
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,287
Wow, that did not help at all.

196
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,083
Maybe just give it a sec.

197
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,962
I've given it a day.

198
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,587
'Course, I've been drunk
for about a week...

199
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,097
So there's that.
Do you want a beer?

200
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,924
- Oh...
- You do.

201
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,260
You want one. Come on.

202
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,311
So, how did you guys
end up at that bar?

203
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,273
Oh, good story.

204
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,101
Well, last week,
Mischa just showed up

205
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,153
at my door... Very dramatic,

206
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,732
telling me how he was
free of the bond, he said,

207
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,658
and that he'd always loved me

208
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,328
and he always would.

209
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,748
Oh.

210
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,199
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah!

211
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,830
So after, you know,
a couple hours in bed...

212
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,161
Just, like...

213
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,212
We decided to celebrate.

214
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,046
I remember the first
five or six bars,

215
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,925
a hotel, I think,
or, some kind of room.

216
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,176
Maybe it was an Uber. Anyway.

217
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,178
We got married.

218
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,593
You...

219
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,145
- Wow.
- Do you like?

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,102
Congratulations.

221
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,558
I...

222
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,061
Yeah, I think after
how bad it was before,

223
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,035
he felt like he had
to prove his love, you know?

224
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,189
He had to... He had to...

225
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,149
Make it permanent.

226
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,364
Right.

227
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,036
So how did he become a bear?

228
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,290
Oh, you know, I don't know.

229
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,287
I mean, 'cause that's some

230
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,418
really powerful magic.

231
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,339
Considering that magic is dead.

232
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,261
Yeah.

233
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,302
Yeah, we met someone...

234
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,343
At a bar, someone he owed...

235
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,396
Something to.

236
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,889
Maybe a battery?

237
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,066
I don't know. Honestly.

238
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,192
It was a woman.

239
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,941
Yeah, I really had to pee,

240
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:42,150
so I hit the ladies',
and I heard all this screaming.

241
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,527
Next thing, he is... He is...

242
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,034
He's hulking out of his clothes,

243
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,206
and he's getting all hairy.

244
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,784
And he's now...
He's full bear, and he's...

245
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,875
Just tearing the place apart.

246
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,049
Right, but... So you think
it was that woman that...

247
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,047
If it was, and you find her,

248
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,049
could you rip
her fucking face off?

249
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,807
Because now I am married
to a zoo animal.

250
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,514
This better be good, Tick.

251
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,814
Majesty,

252
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,490
I know something of this vessel,

253
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,738
and I feel obligated to, uh,

254
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,362
warn you.

255
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,243
Can I please just enjoy the fact

256
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,795
that I have a beautiful boat
and I'm setting off

257
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,838
on a fabulous adventure
for just one second?

258
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,132
Of course, Sire.

259
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,001
Good.

260
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,679
Parade in my head complete.

261
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,144
Make it rain.

262
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,514
First and foremost,

263
00:12:55,692 --> 00:13:00,312
never forget this boat
is made from sentient trees

264
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,864
and therefore has, well,

265
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,574
a personality.

266
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,447
And, uh...

267
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,948
Your Majesty.

268
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,449
Admiral Lacker.

269
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,994
Admiral.

270
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,122
Welcome to the <i>Muntjac,</i> Sire.

271
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,833
There's no faster boat
in all of Fillory

272
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,836
and certainly none more wise
in the ways of seafaring.

273
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,792
Fast. Wise.

274
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
You hear that, Tick?

275
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,932
If you'll follow me.

276
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,062
Nice trick.

277
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,018
The <i>Muntjac</i> designed herself

278
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,772
to explore, do battle,
and deceive.

279
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,692
She can carry threescore
most comfortably.

280
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,574
I sense she's most excited
for this journey.

281
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,280
Her heartwood, Sire.

282
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,117
Happy to see us, I think.

283
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,470
I don't know, Tick.

284
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,670
Off your storm warning,

285
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,551
I was expecting
a Kanye-level diva,

286
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,677
but I'm not even getting
a whiff of atty-patty.

287
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,100
Don't be fooled, Sire.

288
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,893
To use your parlance,

289
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,562
this boat can be a bit of an...

290
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,480
Ass-ditch.

291
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,686
Ass-ditch?

292
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,775
Ass-trench?

293
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,316
- Grave?
- No.

294
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,071
Hole. Asshole!

295
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,572
Oh!

296
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,073
You all right there, Tick?

297
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,204
Fine, Majesty.

298
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,165
We'll require
a master swordsman.

299
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,247
Bingle should be
more than adequate, Sire.

300
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,044
The one who won't talk?

301
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,545
My understanding is he feels

302
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,719
any conversation impedes
concentration,

303
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,013
which, as a swordsman,
is unmatched,

304
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,557
with 72 kills
and never a scratch on him.

305
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,976
Well, you can't argue
with success.

306
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,220
Or a swordsman who won't talk.

307
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,812
Going somewhere, dear wife?

308
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,568
On the voyage with you.

309
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,112
After all, I found the boat.

310
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,439
And I'm forever grateful,

311
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,195
but I do not think
this is a good idea.

312
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,113
Why?

313
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,707
It's perhaps a concept
you're a little

314
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,750
too distracted to get.

315
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,462
It's an excellent idea.

316
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,007
I should know. It was mine.

317
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,969
Any particular reason?

318
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,296
Yes.

319
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,432
But I don't actually
need one, do I?

320
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,347
It'll be wonderful, won't it?

321
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,939
The sea, the sky. Us.

322
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,599
So romantic.

323
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,650
- Additionally...
- Oh, Jesus.

324
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,695
I require someone I trust
to accompany you.

325
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,784
We call her Frail Human.

326
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,203
Fray for short.

327
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,155
Say hello, Fray.

328
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,620
I'd like you to meet
your daughter.

329
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,576
- What?
- No.

330
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,081
- Mmm-mmm.
- No.

331
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,584
- No.
- Our child is a baby.

332
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,256
In the fairy realm,

333
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,834
time folds in on itself
and accelerates.

334
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,171
Fray, I'd like you to meet

335
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,052
your father and mother.

336
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,300
I think it's best
that you both know

337
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,262
I serve and am devoted
only to my queen.

338
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,227
And I feel nothing
for either of you.

339
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,792
Ugh. God.

340
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,289
What a cliché.

341
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,166
The baby that becomes a teenager

342
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,337
practically overnight?

343
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,756
Right?

344
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,333
<i>- Angel.
- Twilight.</i>

345
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,759
<i>- Buffy.</i>
- Technically,

346
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,552
Buffy's sister was never a baby.

347
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,824
She just appeared out of nowhere

348
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,510
and oh, my God.

349
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,592
Two months without dick,
I sound like Quentin.

350
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,221
The point is,

351
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,850
only a creature from
the land TV forgot

352
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,351
would think anybody would fall

353
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,683
for how shocking
and original this is.

354
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,810
So you don't think
Fray is your daughter?

355
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,111
Do you see any resemblance?

356
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,570
I see your wife swooning.

357
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,990
Three hours ago,
my wife was burping a log.

358
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,204
Still.

359
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,115
She has a quality.

360
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,119
Called unearned imperiousness.

361
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,422
Your defining characteristic.

362
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,124
Until you earned it.

363
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,487
Don't tell me you're
falling for this shit.

364
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,594
I mean, look, I'm just saying.

365
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,262
On the off chance she is yours,

366
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,589
you're not gonna strand her

367
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,720
or lock her up
or throw her overboard.

368
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,811
I will do any of the above
and worse if she disobeys me.

369
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,501
- Disobeys what, Father?
- Jesus fuck!

370
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,060
Never do that.

371
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,815
Mmm! Bingle.

372
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,654
You take good care of
your king and his crew, okay?

373
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,323
Mmm-hmm.

374
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,950
Now, one last thing.

375
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,630
What you're doing
is very heroic.

376
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,750
Now, I mean that.

377
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,380
But what's the difference
between a live hero

378
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,260
and a dead moron?

379
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,513
Food tasters?

380
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,020
No.

381
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,401
One dumb decision.

382
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,647
So when it's be brave

383
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,528
or be smart...

384
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,611
You know which one, okay?

385
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,548
A woman. That's not a lot.

386
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,301
Except someone
has big magic, so...

387
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,548
Or had.

388
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,301
It could've all got
used up on Mayakovsky.

389
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,557
No, I don't think so.

390
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,883
The hedges,

391
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,592
they're all going crazy
with rumors

392
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,178
that magic is happening
all over the city.

393
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,266
Central Park sex magic make-out
sessions devolving into orgy.

394
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,101
Fuck. Why didn't I ever do that?

395
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,737
And at St. Brennan's,

396
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,030
someone conjured a dinosaur.

397
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,361
Yeah, I mean,

398
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,694
both places, the rumor is,
it's a female Magician.

399
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,748
White, 30s, a little off
her rocker.

400
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,834
Okay, well we should
split up and cover both.

401
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,627
Yeah.

402
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,171
You're taking sex magic,
aren't you?

403
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,625
Let's go.

404
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,467
- It was awesome.
- Wait. What was, hon?

405
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,513
What magazine do you
write for again?

406
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,887
<i>National Geographic.</i>

407
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,845
A dinosaur, right there
in the courtyard.

408
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,688
You wouldn't happen to know

409
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,515
what kind of dinosaur,
would you?

410
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,852
One of the kids drew a picture
of what we all wanted.

411
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,279
We made it up,
and she made it real.

412
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,989
And how big?

413
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,816
And how hungry...

414
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,535
Medium. And it's a herbivore.

415
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,237
That's good to know.

416
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,869
We named it Androsaurus.

417
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,372
So it looks like half man,
half dinosaur?

418
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,543
How'd you know?

419
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,962
Well, andro, it's Greek for...

420
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,710
I think I need
to see some credentials.

421
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,005
Dinosaur!

422
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,761
- There it is!
- Wait, wait. Stop.

423
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,299
Get away from the window!

424
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,719
Come on.

425
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,429
- Come on.
- What?

426
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,875
Maybe it'll go
to whoever conjured it.

427
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,606
- Come on.
- Slow down!

428
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,393
Let's go!

429
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,605
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

430
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,370
I honestly wake up
in the morning and pretty much

431
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,494
nothing I think
is going to happen, happens.

432
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,457
Shh! Shut up.

433
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,047
Okay, just don't go so fast.

434
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,477
Better?

435
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,972
Well,

436
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,646
I have nothing left to puke,
so technically I'm...

437
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,849
Aye, aye.

438
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:21,945
You should get some rest.

439
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,606
In a bit.

440
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,110
Fen.

441
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,619
I know you have
your doubts, but...

442
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,613
She has your eyes.

443
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,616
In that she has
two facing forward,

444
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,542
yes, she's got my eyes.

445
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,457
She's ours.

446
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,375
I feel it.

447
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,217
You don't?

448
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,003
I want to. I do.

449
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,806
But all I know is that

450
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,354
she is huge for a two-month-old.

451
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,813
Look, she is a spy
for the Fairy Queen.

452
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,771
It's probably better
if she's not our daughter.

453
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,650
All my life, I've wanted
a family of my own.

454
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,743
And I know this isn't ideal.

455
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,743
We've missed so much
with her, but...

456
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,120
It's not her fault.

457
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,914
She needs the one thing
in life she's never had.

458
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,378
Manners?

459
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,172
Love.

460
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,027
Hi, excuse me,

461
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,113
I was just...
I don't mean to interrupt.

462
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,456
Oh! No, no.
I'm... I'm not interested.

463
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,687
But thanks for the offer though.

464
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,997
That's very kind.

465
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,793
Hi, I know this might be
a little awkward,

466
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,966
maybe not the best time.
No, I was just wondering

467
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,153
if maybe you had seen someone.

468
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,258
Hi, sorry.

469
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,254
I just wanted to ask
if maybe one of you...

470
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,091
All right, super helpful.

471
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,180
Appreciate... Whoa.

472
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,603
- No, no, no, no, no.
- On.

473
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,605
- You okay?
- Yeah.

474
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,691
- Yeah.
- Okay.

475
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,811
- Okay.
- I don't...

476
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,004
I don't know what just happened.

477
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,109
I'm just gonna...

478
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,276
I feel...

479
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,695
Let's do a lap.

480
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,030
I still don't think
it's a good idea

481
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,535
for you two to come along.

482
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,208
Our first family trip.

483
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,830
Oh, God.

484
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,457
Are you crying?

485
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,550
I hereby declare After Island

486
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,757
a province of Fillory!

487
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,229
Hello.

488
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,060
I'm your new king.

489
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,937
No need to bow or cheer.

490
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,239
I have an extremely healthy
self-image.

491
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,615
Where's your leader?

492
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,163
Governor? Mayor?

493
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,285
Tin pot dictator?

494
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,003
Father Poe is in prayer,
preparing.

495
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,126
- For?
- The attack.

496
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,465
By?

497
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:31,843
The... The monster.

498
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,805
Of course.

499
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,298
Husband,

500
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,008
we should offer our king
refreshment.

501
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,594
Let's just get back
to the monster thing

502
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,179
for just one second.

503
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,436
It... It tries
to kill us every few days.

504
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,858
That's troubling.

505
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,938
Father Poe will protect us,
as always.

506
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,565
Now he'll protect you as well.

507
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,902
Do you like roasted boar?

508
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,208
Just stop it. No means no.

509
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,374
Come on.

510
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,162
Alice?

511
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,165
- Shit.
- Alice, hey.

512
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,797
How did you...
What are you doing here?

513
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,172
Same as you, I guess.

514
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,387
Following all this crazy magic,

515
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,339
hoping it leads
to Mayakovsky's batteries.

516
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,435
By yourself?

517
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,346
Took four of us to...

518
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,064
Well, you are Alice Quinn.

519
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,732
Yeah, whoever that is now.

520
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,685
- Can I just say something?
- No!

521
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,909
Okay.

522
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,778
One question.

523
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,914
I needed a pet.
Is that so weird?

524
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,162
All right,

525
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,083
everybody who's doing what
you're doing to each other,

526
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,756
stop immediately,
or you will be arrested.

527
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,633
Did you get anything?

529
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,089
Uh, so,

530
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,719
this was cast by a woman,
clearly,

531
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,425
although the muggles
didn't know that.

532
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,057
They said she was talking
about the loss of magic,

533
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,059
and the need for wonder.

534
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,685
Okay, did you get a name, or...

535
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,392
No, just that she was asking

536
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,255
where the nearest building
was to jump off of.

537
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,690
The old post office on 58th.

538
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,855
How do you know that?

539
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,178
Abandoned building,
easy roof access, and great views.

540
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,784
It was the number one
midtown spot

541
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,078
when I was into that kind
of thing as a possibility.

542
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,263
Greetings, Your Majesty.

543
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,352
Father Poe.

544
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,730
I understand you have
a bit of a monster issue.

545
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,243
I'd be happy to send my navy,
but first,

546
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,825
I'm looking for something.

547
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,668
A golden key.

548
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,179
It can't be that easy.

549
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,007
I'm sorry, Sire,

550
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,844
it's impossible for me
to give you this.

551
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,478
Oh, well...

552
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,440
As your new monarch,

553
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,101
I'm afraid I have to insist.

554
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,948
It's the only thing
keeping us alive.

555
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,449
It's coming back!

556
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,253
Holy shit.

557
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,127
Call 911.

558
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,212
Wait, are you... Q!

559
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,638
Q, what are you...

560
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,436
Majesty, I urge you.

561
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Hide!

562
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,167
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

563
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,373
Quentin?

564
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,625
Professor Lipson?

565
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,587
Hey, it's nice to see you, um...

566
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,922
Stop!

567
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,785
Oh, Jesus. It's Lipson.

568
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,700
Who?

569
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,744
Please.

570
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,246
You don't wanna do this.

571
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,836
Not after you just made
such beautiful magic.

572
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,085
Magic is dead.

573
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,171
No, but it's not, and you
proved that today, right?

574
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,972
With Mayakovsky's battery.

575
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,970
It's not his.

576
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,221
It's mine.

577
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,223
Yes, of course, of course it is.

578
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,225
Do you think that he could
make this without me?

579
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,103
Where do you think he got the
living metal in Antarctica?

580
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,855
Me. Me.

581
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,313
Everything he asked for,
I gave him everything.

582
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,148
The fucking bastard!

583
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,608
Yes, God, totally.

584
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,360
I told him...

585
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,945
I was the one that told him
that this day would come,

586
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,120
that it wouldn't last.

587
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,323
And that was so smart.

588
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,602
We all...
We should've seen that.

589
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,666
And then he walks in there

590
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,995
with that fucking slut,
that whore!

591
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,089
Calling her his wife?

592
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,335
The goddamn world is ending!

593
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,133
And all we have is each other,

594
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,882
and he does this to me now!

595
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,931
Look, he is the worst,
and he got what he deserved,

596
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,974
but I get what you did.
You were raging

597
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,352
against the dying of the light.

598
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,265
Yes. Yes.

599
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,892
We really didn't know
how good we had it, did we?

600
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,603
We whined and complained

601
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,986
about everything
that magic couldn't do

602
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,283
because we couldn't see
that a world without it was

603
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,830
dark and mean and pointless.

604
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,582
Yeah. Exactly.

605
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,205
Whoa, no, no! Please, please.

606
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,709
It was me.
It was my fault, okay?

607
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,210
And I'm going to fix it.

608
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,611
Look, we've already...
We've started...

609
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,127
You can't fix this, Quentin.

610
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,221
It's over. It's over.

611
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,592
This. This is all there is.

612
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,720
And I used it
to give joy to sick kids,

613
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,474
and to bring love to strangers
who were dead inside.

614
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,305
And you know what?
I hope he sees.

615
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,733
I hope he sees and knows
that I used all of it

616
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,027
for something that he would
never use!

617
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,404
Look, he got
what he deserved, okay?

618
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:10,359
Honestly, I think that it was
brilliant turning him into a bear.

619
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,322
A bear? What?
What are you talking about?

620
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,703
In the bar, when you met him,

621
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,826
and he brought Emily,
and he gave you that,

622
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,002
and you turned him in...

623
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,393
God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

624
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,556
Quentin, let me go!

625
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,467
Let me go!

626
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,848
Quentin!

627
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,449
Yeah, then we lost it
on Madison.

628
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,531
I still think it went into
that falafel place.

629
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,323
No, you were hungry.

630
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,579
So was he.

631
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,456
And it was
a vegan falafel place,

632
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,163
so, herbivore. Logic. Whatever.

633
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,462
Hello?

634
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,044
He's what? Where?

635
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,632
Okay, not to be
a cold-hearted bastard,

636
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,341
but I'm a cold-hearted bastard.

637
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,847
The battery?

638
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,520
Well, that's just unfair.

639
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,689
There's something that...

640
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,564
I told Lipson that
I thought it was great

641
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,364
that she turned
Mayakovsky into a bear,

642
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,211
and she had no idea
what I was talking about.

643
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,951
Well, yeah,
because she's insane.

644
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,737
Well, I just,

645
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,743
I don't think that she did it.

646
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,449
Then who did?

647
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,751
Someone else at the bar.

648
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,703
Who had another battery?

649
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,627
Yeah, but is...

650
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,753
Oh, God.

651
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,264
What...

652
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,568
Sorry, Officer.

653
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,618
Our friend's cat was sick

654
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,448
and exploded.

655
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,703
You know, like they do.

656
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,136
Is it dead?

657
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,559
It can't be killed.

658
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,766
How do you know?

659
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,901
She's right.

660
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,318
It's a shadow bat.

661
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,063
It's not really alive,
so it can't be killed.

662
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,570
We have them in the Fairy Realm.

663
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,826
Husband.

664
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,698
No. No!

665
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,545
He didn't get inside.
I couldn't save him.

666
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,340
I'm sorry.

667
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,962
Now you see.

668
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,764
I can never give you this key.

669
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,938
Hey, open the door.

670
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,732
We know you have the battery...

671
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,394
What happened?

672
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,153
You're not as quick
as your friend.

673
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,281
She took it.

674
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,446
Alice?

675
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,822
Kady.

676
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,762
She's the only one
who hits that hard.

677
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,305
Wait, you had
the battery the whole time?

678
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,329
Of course I did.

679
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,414
So, wait, so,

680
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,248
- you turned Mayakovsky into a bear?
- Mmm-hmm.

681
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,457
Isn't he your husband?

682
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,410
Which is the only reason
I didn't kill him.

683
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,749
Where's Kady?

684
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,250
I kinda missed it

685
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,297
'cause I was on the ground.

686
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,545
Bleeding.

687
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,261
My child,

688
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,881
you do not grieve alone.

689
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,974
I, the Father, grieve with you.

690
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,431
You do not des...

691
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,769
Get away from him!

692
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,856
Please.

693
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,606
Tell her not to do that.

694
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,692
Fray!

695
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,565
Pardon me for one second.

696
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:39,887
You sure?

697
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,013
I've seen the wounds
the shadow bat makes.

698
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,091
The fangs are serrated.

699
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,059
The wounds are messy.

700
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,598
And much...

701
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,981
Bigger.

702
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,682
And as the daughter
of a blademaker,

703
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,313
I'm telling you

704
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,894
a blade killed the villager.

705
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,617
Okay, so I'll go to Brakebills.

706
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,014
Q, you try the restaurant
where she works,

707
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,700
and Josh,
you wanna take her apartment?

708
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,827
Look, I just need
to know the action plan, okay?

709
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,081
If I do find her, do I,
what, just grab the battery?

710
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,294
Even if she's using it
at that exact moment

711
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,417
to save Penny?

712
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,715
And even if saving Penny
means the battery's dead?

713
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,528
Or the battery has enough
juice to save Penny

714
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,472
and help us, she just
doesn't want me to have it.

715
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,596
I mean, which I totally get,
from her perspective.

716
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,548
Only I'm not her, I'm me,

717
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,680
and I'm trying to fix the whole
fuckness that is the universe.

718
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,353
Look, let's just find her,
and then we'll

719
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,647
figure out all the moral Jenga.

720
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,812
Said he needed to see you.

721
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,672
I tried to get him to come
inside, but he wouldn't.

722
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,028
Thanks, Maggie.

723
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,566
- Should I call an ambulance?
- No.

724
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,717
No, no, no.
Thanks. I can handle this.

725
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,982
- Okay.
- Hi.

726
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,276
God, what the fuck, dude?

727
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,653
I just...

728
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,867
I felt like it was my time,
and I...

729
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,411
I just wanted
to be with you when I...

730
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,375
No, no.

731
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,918
No, you're not going to, okay?

732
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,756
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

733
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,133
Come on.

734
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,509
Let's get you out of here.

735
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,475
What is the meaning of this?

736
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,314
Excellent question.

737
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,029
What is the meaning of this?

738
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,820
I have an idea.

739
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,864
Let's test it out.

740
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,831
Bingle?

741
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,541
Kill him.

742
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,048
Or...

743
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,588
Do it.

744
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,638
Do what?

745
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,681
One more word
and you'll be dead.

746
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,976
But I'll still
have the key, so...

747
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,896
Do it.

748
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,887
Guys!

749
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,556
Your new king
commands you to stay put!

750
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,039
Gee, Father.

751
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,965
Weren't you scared?

752
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,179
It's illusion magic.

753
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,966
He's been using it
to make you all afraid.

754
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,135
There is no monster.

755
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:20,564
Well, I guess
he kinda qualifies,

756
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,812
because how many of you

757
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,020
have died at the hands
of your priest

758
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,576
to make him your
uncontested leader and hero?

759
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,778
My friend lost his life.

760
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,081
Reminds me of what
a good friend once told me.

761
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:42,127
What's the difference
between a hero and a moron?

762
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,173
One bad decision.

763
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,226
No.

764
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,848
No! No!

765
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,638
He's lying.

766
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,481
He's lying to you!

767
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,559
No! No!

768
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,903
No!

769
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,255
I know you're behind me.

770
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,836
Thank you, by the way.

771
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,199
We wouldn't have been able
to figure it out without...

772
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,339
You didn't do it.

773
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,136
Do what?

774
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,183
What you told my queen
you came to do...

775
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,728
Collect taxes...
You just came for that key.

776
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,976
Why?

777
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,975
It's gold.

778
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,730
And magic.

779
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,152
Maybe the only magic anywhere.

780
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,195
What could be
more valuable than that?

781
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,869
I'm not sure I believe you.

782
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,407
And I can't believe
I finally get to say this.

783
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,996
Don't talk back
to your father and me.

784
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,870
That felt nice, didn't it?

785
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,627
- I am here to assure that...
- My turn.

786
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,716
Go to your room.

787
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,177
We're a family.

788
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,884
Well, we are certainly
fucked up enough to be.

789
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,841
Holy shit.

790
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,849
Hey.

791
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,219
Help you?
