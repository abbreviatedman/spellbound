1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,378
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,735
<i>As a Niffin, you made enemies.</i>

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,704
One of them seeks
you... The Lamprey.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,839
You're down to an
early warning device.

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,901
An alarm, if you will.
What is that, a joke?

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,204
Cancer. Call it cancer plus.

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,858
Every time you
leave this branch,

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,373
you go where time
moves normally,

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,679
and where time progresses...

10
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,310
So does my super cancer. I know.

11
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,685
I wanna do a spell. A cheat day.

12
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,551
I'm just putting
it all together.

13
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,390
Just tell me what you think,

14
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,692
and could you maybe
try a Russian accent?

15
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,926
Mayakovsky. That's a battery.

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,796
That holds magical current.

17
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,101
How many of those do you have?

18
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,399
My people need
help. They sure do.

19
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,966
I'll send you on an epic quest.

20
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,566
<i>The Tale of the Seven Keys.</i>

21
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,943
Jules, this is our quest.

22
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,112
And we're already on it.

23
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,448
<i>The Tale of the Seven Keys.</i>

24
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,612
<i>Chapter one.</i>

25
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,925
<i>"Long ago, in a far-off kingdom,</i>

26
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,291
<i>"lived the daughter
of a brave knight.</i>

27
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,499
<i>"The knight had
always wanted a son</i>

28
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,469
<i>"to whom he might
pass on his skills.</i>

29
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,102
<i>"So, while father and
daughter loved one another,</i>

30
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,406
<i>"she often felt herself a
disappointment to him.</i>

31
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,641
<i>"One day, a witch
kidnapped the knight.</i>

32
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,620
<i>"The daughter pleaded
with her to return him.</i>

33
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,960
<i>"The witch said no,
but he could be rescued</i>

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,795
<i>"if the girl could
complete a quest.</i>

35
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,495
<i>"" There are seven
keys, ' said the witch.</i>

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,635
<i>"" Find them, and you can
open your father's prison...</i>

37
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,541
<i>"" The Castle At The
End of the World.'</i>

38
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,704
<i>"The witch told the daughter
the first key was to be found</i>

39
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,612
<i>"on an island
beyond her kingdom,</i>

40
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,417
<i>"so she sailed past
the Outer Islands.</i>

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,016
<i>"And while the voyage
was treacherous,</i>

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,819
<i>"her destination was more so,</i>

43
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:10,660
"for nothing was as it
seemed on After Island."

44
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,729
Wow. Okay.

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,066
So, then...

46
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,734
Then...

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,673
Jesus.

48
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,724
This book is more withholding
than my last girlfriend.

49
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,013
Right, so the first quest

50
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,449
is in Fillory.

51
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,486
Eliot's taking point.

52
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,897
Yeah, but we should
be there with him.

53
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,041
Hell, yeah, we should.

54
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,058
Quests are not a solo op,

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,060
and thanks to Dean Fogg and
the world's biggest FedEx bill,

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,493
we've got the clock.

57
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,254
So all we need is magic.

58
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,762
Which is where
you come in, right?

59
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,029
Wrong. I mean, that
would be like trying

60
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,333
to power a Ferrari
on a drop of unleaded.

61
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,873
So we power this puppy how?

62
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,501
Mayakovsky. Yes.

63
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,687
Can I focus on something I
don't wanna punch in the face?

64
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,821
He had four batteries
in Brakebills South.

65
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,404
He said that's
all he had, but...

66
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,177
He's a lying drunk, so
of course he had more.

67
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,182
And he's been MIA since
magic got shut down.

68
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,222
And if he's roaming the
earth, he's using them.

69
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,187
If only to scam chicks.

70
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,520
Any ideas where?

71
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,718
No.

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,754
I mean, magic
might be dead, but...

73
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,395
Google isn't.

74
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,498
So...

75
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,264
We're out of dough.

76
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,260
Moolah.

77
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,198
Chedda.

78
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,971
Money, people.

79
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,940
Magic's gone.

80
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,106
We can't even control the
gold-shitting beetles anymore,

81
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,775
and now they've
declared themselves free

82
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,044
and disappeared.

83
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,583
We're about to be
a third world country

84
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,327
on a planet with two
and a half countries.

85
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,891
Yes, which is why the
Council and I are wondering

86
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,086
why we're spending so much money

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,685
on a very old ship.

88
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,095
Thank you for
asking, Queen Margo.

89
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,466
The <i>Muntjac</i> is the fastest
boat in our ancient, leaky fleet,

90
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,765
and the best way to
reach the Outer Islands,

91
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,966
where taxes haven't
been collected in...

92
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,540
46 years, 3 months, and 7 days.

93
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,602
So let's just be clear here
about how government works.

94
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,848
We can't do anything
without money.

95
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,694
Now, if there are any
dissenting opinions

96
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,243
as to my royal order,

97
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,154
I will remind the Council
that this is not a democracy.

98
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,785
Truer words never spoken.

99
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,720
And this meeting

100
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:28,030
is to inform all assembled
here what I intend to do.

101
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,168
We'll see.

102
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,109
Me, either.

103
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,949
Guys?

104
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,757
Is that a hedge witch bar?

105
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,893
Caught my eye.

106
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,527
What... Where'd you find this?

107
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,765
YouTube. Urban Freakfest.

108
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,641
Was just posted.

109
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,773
<i>Stop it, Mischa, no!</i>

110
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,007
Okay, that's cool.

111
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,318
Point one,
Mayakovsky's first name...

112
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,320
Mischa. Right.

113
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,855
The "Joe" of Russia.

114
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,858
Point two, the
symbol of Russia...

115
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,359
A brown bear.

116
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,020
Point three... Recognize that?

117
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,595
Yeah, that does
kinda look like...

118
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,190
Yep. And point four...

119
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,735
That bear is a dick.

120
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,541
<i>Da.</i>

121
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,111
How old is this one?

122
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,207
Moses is eight months.

123
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,376
That's too old.

124
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,347
What about...

125
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,185
First, I... Need to know

126
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,885
whether you have
fully accepted Jesus

127
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,683
as your savior.

128
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,194
Pardon?

129
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,022
What about this one?

130
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,725
Hester is five months.

131
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,234
I'll take her.

132
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,604
I do need you to swear to me

133
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,700
that you'll protect this animal,

134
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,745
and Hester shall see no evil.

135
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,423
So, wait, Mayakovsky

136
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:15,299
uses the last drops of magic
anywhere for a bar trick?

137
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,132
Or maybe someone did it to him.

138
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,263
Or the bear could
just be a bear.

139
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,331
Look, do you
recognize this place?

140
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,143
You said you had
something else to show me?

141
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,989
Wait... How?

142
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,893
I don't know, but
it's all I can do,

143
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,341
which is almost worse
than nothing at all.

144
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,834
But if Mayakovsky
was in New York City

145
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,012
with a battery big enough
to turn himself into a bear,

146
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,197
maybe there are more.

147
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,348
And if Julia could get her hands

148
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,738
on one of those batteries...

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,173
Then maybe we could help Penny.

150
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,836
That is a hedge bar.

151
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,177
I was 86-ed, so just get us in.

152
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,240
Yeah, well, recent history
doesn't do much for your credibility

153
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,183
when it comes to
you, me, and a plan.

154
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,016
How sick is Penny? Fuck you.

155
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,649
Look, if Penny
doesn't need magic, go.

156
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,363
D. Hey.

157
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,993
Hey.

158
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,363
It's good to see you, K.

159
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,202
Yeah, you too.

160
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,001
So, the bear?

161
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,545
Yeah, that was weird. I mean...

162
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,241
I've seen weirder, but

163
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,873
not in a while.

164
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,950
It kinda gave me hope.

165
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,178
Yeah.

166
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,055
Do you remember what
happened right before?

167
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,021
Yeah, you could
smell it first, then feel it.

168
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,422
I mean, everyone in here could.

169
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,169
You know, it's like, you're
starving for two months

170
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,321
and all of a sudden, steak's
on the grill, you know?

171
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,921
The whole room started buzzing

172
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,932
and everyone zeroed in
on this drunk Russian guy

173
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,076
and the girl he came in with.

174
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Uh, is...

175
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,225
Was that, um...

176
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,804
Was that the guy? DONOVAN: Yeah.

177
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,202
Jeez, that guy's a prick.

178
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,797
Wait, I'm sorry,

179
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,151
are you saying
that it's possible

180
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,973
he turned himself into a bear?

181
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,875
You know what? That
guy was so wasted.

182
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,323
I don't think he knew
what he was doing.

183
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,557
And the girl was
trying to control him,

184
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,913
but she wasn't exactly sober,

185
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,815
so it was a lot at once.

186
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,580
Anything else you can remember?

187
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,384
She was way too
young for that guy.

188
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,290
Wait, was that
her? Is that the girl?

189
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,554
Yeah, that's her. Yep.

190
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,192
All right, hey, I should
probably see her alone.

191
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,099
Well... Emily, even at her best,

192
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,547
which she's probably
not right now, is a little...

193
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,096
Crazy?

194
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,230
Vulnerable.

195
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,478
Wow, that did not help at all.

196
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,281
Maybe just give it a sec.

197
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,159
I've given it a day.

198
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,793
'Course, I've been
drunk for about a week...

199
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,291
So there's that. Do
you want a beer?

200
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,128
Oh... You do.

201
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,466
You want one. Come on.

202
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,506
So, how did you guys
end up at that bar?

203
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,474
Oh, good story.

204
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,306
Well, last week,
Mischa just showed up

205
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,347
at my door... Very dramatic,

206
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,940
telling me how he was
free of the bond, he said,

207
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,849
and that he'd always loved me

208
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,515
and he always would.

209
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,957
Oh.

210
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,424
Well, that's great. Yeah!

211
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,019
So after, you know, a
couple hours in bed...

212
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,358
Just, like...

213
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,432
We decided to celebrate.

214
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,230
I remember the
first five or six bars,

215
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,131
a hotel, I think, or,
some kind of room.

216
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,368
Maybe it was an Uber. Anyway.

217
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,374
We got married.

218
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,807
You...

219
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,346
Wow. Do you like?

220
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,311
Congratulations.

221
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,247
Yeah, I think after
how bad it was before,

222
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,233
he felt like he had to
prove his love, you know?

223
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,384
He had to... He had to...

224
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,357
Make it permanent.

225
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,553
Right.

226
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,225
So how did he become a bear?

227
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,503
Oh, you know, I don't know.

228
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,502
I mean, 'cause that's some

229
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,633
really powerful magic.

230
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,545
Considering that magic is dead.

231
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,478
Yeah.

232
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,517
Yeah, we met someone...

233
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,552
At a bar, someone he owed...

234
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,590
Something to.

235
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,086
Maybe a battery?

236
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,252
I don't know. Honestly.

237
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,390
It was a woman.

238
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,124
Yeah, I really had to pee,

239
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:42,362
so I hit the ladies', and I
heard all this screaming.

240
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,730
Next thing, he is... He is...

241
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,239
He's hulking out of his clothes,

242
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,401
and he's getting all hairy.

243
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,978
And he's now... He's
full bear, and he's...

244
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,079
Just tearing the place apart.

245
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,244
Right, but... So you think
it was that woman that...

246
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,254
If it was, and you find her,

247
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,256
could you rip her
fucking face off?

248
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,990
Because now I am
married to a zoo animal.

249
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,732
This better be good, Tick.

250
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,008
Majesty,

251
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,701
I know something of this vessel,

252
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,938
and I feel obligated to, uh,

253
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,580
warn you.

254
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,451
Can I please just enjoy the fact

255
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,989
that I have a beautiful
boat and I'm setting off

256
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,025
on a fabulous adventure
for just one second?

257
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,320
Of course, Sire.

258
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,195
Good.

259
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,860
Parade in my head complete.

260
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,332
Make it rain.

261
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,732
First and foremost,

262
00:12:55,875 --> 00:13:00,506
never forget this boat is
made from sentient trees

263
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,050
and therefore has, well,

264
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,782
a personality.

265
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,650
And, uh...

266
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,148
Your Majesty.

267
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,656
Admiral Lacker.

268
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,186
Admiral.

269
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,325
Welcome to the <i>Muntjac,</i> Sire.

270
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,025
There's no faster
boat in all of Fillory

271
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,034
and certainly none more
wise in the ways of seafaring.

272
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,001
Fast. Wise.

273
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,404
You hear that, Tick?

274
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,141
If you'll follow me.

275
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,248
Nice trick.

276
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,208
The <i>Muntjac</i> designed herself

277
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,981
to explore, do
battle, and deceive.

278
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,880
She can carry threescore
most comfortably.

279
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,794
I sense she's most
excited for this journey.

280
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,495
Her heartwood, Sire.

281
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,336
Happy to see us, I think.

282
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,718
I don't know, Tick.

283
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:07,873
Off your storm warning,

284
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,744
I was expecting a
Kanye-level diva,

285
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,875
but I'm not even getting
a whiff of atty-patty.

286
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,282
Don't be fooled, Sire.

287
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,082
To use your parlance,

288
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,748
this boat can be a bit of an...

289
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,689
Ass-ditch.

290
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,889
Ass-ditch?

291
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,993
Ass-trench?

292
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,527
Grave? No.

293
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,263
Hole. Asshole!

294
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,770
Oh!

295
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,273
You all right there, Tick?

296
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,402
Fine, Majesty.

297
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,406
We'll require a
master swordsman.

298
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,439
Bingle should be more
than adequate, Sire.

299
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,241
The one who won't talk?

300
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,752
My understanding is he feels

301
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,913
any conversation
impedes concentration,

302
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,217
which, as a swordsman,
is unmatched,

303
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,759
with 72 kills and
never a scratch on him.

304
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,159
Well, you can't
argue with success.

305
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,426
Or a swordsman who won't talk.

306
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,029
Going somewhere, dear wife?

307
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,768
On the voyage with you.

308
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,306
After all, I found the boat.

309
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,636
And I'm forever grateful,

310
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,403
but I do not think
this is a good idea.

311
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,306
Why?

312
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,913
It's perhaps a
concept you're a little

313
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,954
too distracted to get.

314
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,654
It's an excellent idea.

315
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,192
I should know. It was mine.

316
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,163
Any particular reason?

317
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,493
Yes.

318
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,625
But I don't actually
need one, do I?

319
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,534
It'll be wonderful, won't it?

320
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,132
The sea, the sky. Us.

321
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,799
So romantic.

322
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,845
Additionally... Oh, Jesus.

323
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,915
I require someone I
trust to accompany you.

324
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,980
We call her Frail Human.

325
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,385
Fray for short.

326
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,355
Say hello, Fray.

327
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,826
I'd like you to
meet your daughter.

328
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,785
What? No.

329
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,288
Mmm-mmm. FEN: No.

330
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,790
No. Our child is a baby.

331
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,465
In the fairy realm,

332
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,026
time folds in on
itself and accelerates.

333
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,366
Fray, I'd like you to meet

334
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,238
your father and mother.

335
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,506
I think it's best
that you both know

336
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,480
I serve and am devoted
only to my queen.

337
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,415
And I feel nothing
for either of you.

338
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,997
Ugh. God.

339
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,504
What a cliché.

340
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,369
The baby that becomes a teenager

341
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,533
practically overnight?

342
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,940
Right?

343
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,533
<i>Angel. Twilight.</i>

344
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,943
<i>Buffy.</i> Technically,

345
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,741
Buffy's sister was never a baby.

346
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,024
She just appeared out of nowhere

347
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,710
and oh, my God.

348
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,775
Two months without
dick, I sound like Quentin.

349
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,411
The point is,

350
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,047
only a creature from
the land TV forgot

351
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,556
would think anybody would fall

352
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,890
for how shocking
and original this is.

353
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,025
So you don't think
Fray is your daughter?

354
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,332
Do you see any resemblance?

355
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,759
I see your wife swooning.

356
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,205
Three hours ago, my
wife was burping a log.

357
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,404
Still.

358
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,332
She has a quality.

359
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,336
Called unearned imperiousness.

360
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,615
Your defining characteristic.

361
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,350
Until you earned it.

362
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,695
Don't tell me you're
falling for this shit.

363
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,779
I mean, look, I'm just saying.

364
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,447
On the off chance she is yours,

365
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,786
you're not gonna strand her

366
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,926
or lock her up or
throw her overboard.

367
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,992
I will do any of the above
and worse if she disobeys me.

368
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,550
Disobeys what,
Father? Jesus fuck!

369
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,264
Never do that.

370
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,998
Mmm! Bingle.

371
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:57,840
You take good care of your
king and his crew, okay?

372
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,502
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,146
Now, one last thing.

374
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,825
What you're doing
is very heroic.

375
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:14,956
Now, I mean that.

376
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,598
But what's the difference
between a live hero

377
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,463
and a dead moron?

378
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,699
Food tasters?

379
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,237
No.

380
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,612
One dumb decision.

381
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,847
So when it's be brave

382
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,713
or be smart...

383
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,814
You know which one, okay?

384
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,731
A woman. That's not a lot.

385
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,504
Except someone
has big magic, so...

386
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,732
Or had.

387
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,501
It could've all got used
up on Mayakovsky.

388
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,741
No, I don't think so.

389
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,071
The hedges,

390
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,804
they're all going
crazy with rumors

391
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,370
that magic is happening
all over the city.

392
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,475
Central Park sex magic make-out
sessions devolving into orgy.

393
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,315
Fuck. Why didn't I ever do that?

394
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,914
And at St. Brennan's,

395
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,219
someone conjured a dinosaur.

396
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,551
Yeah, I mean,

397
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,892
both places, the rumor
is, it's a female Magician.

398
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,933
White, 30s, a
little off her rocker.

399
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,028
Okay, well we should
split up and cover both.

400
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,836
Yeah.

401
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,374
You're taking sex
magic, aren't you?

402
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,836
Let's go.

403
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,678
It was awesome.
Wait. What was, hon?

404
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,717
What magazine do
you write for again?

405
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,083
<i>National Geographic.</i>

406
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,054
A dinosaur, right
there in the courtyard.

407
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,882
You wouldn't happen to know

408
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,721
what kind of
dinosaur, would you?

409
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,059
One of the kids drew a
picture of what we all wanted.

410
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,496
We made it up,
and she made it real.

411
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,197
And how big?

412
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,031
And how hungry...

413
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,735
Medium. And it's a herbivore.

414
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,433
That's good to know.

415
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,066
We named it Androsaurus.

416
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,570
So it looks like half
man, half dinosaur?

417
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,738
How'd you know?

418
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,146
Well, andro, it's Greek for...

419
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,910
I think I need to see
some credentials.

420
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,211
Dinosaur!

421
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,955
- There it is!
- Wait, wait. Stop.

422
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,521
Get away from the window!

423
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,922
Come on.

424
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,624
Come on. What?

425
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,076
Maybe it'll go to
whoever conjured it.

426
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,796
Come on. Slow down!

427
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,598
Let's go!

428
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

429
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,579
I honestly wake up in the
morning and pretty much

430
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,708
nothing I think is going
to happen, happens.

431
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,649
Shh! Shut up.

432
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,258
Okay, just don't go so fast.

433
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,668
Better?

434
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,170
Well,

435
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,833
I have nothing left to
puke, so technically I'm...

436
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,034
Aye, aye.

437
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,141
You should get some rest.

438
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,808
In a bit.

439
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,317
Fen.

440
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,822
I know you have
your doubts, but...

441
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,813
She has your eyes.

442
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,825
In that she has
two facing forward,

443
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,760
yes, she's got my eyes.

444
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,654
She's ours.

445
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,561
I feel it.

446
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
You don't?

447
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,199
I want to. I do.

448
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,001
But all I know is that

449
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,545
she is huge for a two-month-old.

450
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,020
Look, she is a spy
for the Fairy Queen.

451
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,988
It's probably better if
she's not our daughter.

452
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,852
All my life, I've wanted
a family of my own.

453
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,963
And I know this isn't ideal.

454
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,957
We've missed so
much with her, but...

455
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,329
It's not her fault.

456
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,097
She needs the one thing
in life she's never had.

457
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,566
Manners?

458
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,372
Love.

459
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,227
Hi, excuse me,

460
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,296
I was just... I don't
mean to interrupt.

461
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,637
Oh! No, no. I'm...
I'm not interested.

462
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,887
But thanks for the offer though.

463
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,209
That's very kind.

464
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,007
Hi, I know this might
be a little awkward,

465
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,143
maybe not the best time.
No, I was just wondering

466
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,362
if maybe you had seen someone.

467
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,445
Hi, sorry.

468
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,449
I just wanted to ask
if maybe one of you...

469
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,285
All right, super helpful.

470
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,392
Appreciate... Whoa.

471
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,795
No, no, no, no, no. On.

472
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,790
You okay? Yeah.

473
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah. Okay.

474
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,026
Okay. I don't...

475
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,212
I don't know what just happened.

476
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,295
I'm just gonna...

477
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,463
I feel...

478
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,904
Let's do a lap.

479
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,245
I still don't think
it's a good idea

480
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,750
for you two to come along.

481
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,410
Our first family trip.

482
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,045
Oh, God.

483
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,646
Are you crying?

484
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,758
I hereby declare After Island

485
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,959
a province of Fillory!

486
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,437
Hello.

487
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,266
I'm your new king.

488
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,146
No need to bow or cheer.

489
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,445
I have an extremely
healthy self-image.

490
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,815
Where's your leader?

491
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,357
Governor? Mayor?

492
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,482
Tin pot dictator?

493
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:25,192
Father Poe is in
prayer, preparing.

494
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,323
For? The attack.

495
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,666
By?

496
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,035
The... The monster.

497
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,005
Of course.

498
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,506
Husband,

499
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,203
we should offer our
king refreshment.

500
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,802
Let's just get back
to the monster thing

501
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,370
for just one second.

502
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,645
It... It tries to kill
us every few days.

503
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,044
That's troubling.

504
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,146
Father Poe will
protect us, as always.

505
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,754
Now he'll protect you as well.

506
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,123
Do you like roasted boar?

507
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,393
Just stop it. No means no.

508
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,561
Come on.

509
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,371
Alice?

510
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,366
Shit. Alice, hey.

511
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,002
How did you... What
are you doing here?

512
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,376
Same as you, I guess.

513
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,582
Following all this crazy magic,

514
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,548
hoping it leads to
Mayakovsky's batteries.

515
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,615
By yourself?

516
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,546
Took four of us to...

517
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,264
Well, you are Alice Quinn.

518
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,917
Yeah, whoever that is now.

519
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,886
Can I just say something? No!

520
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,101
Okay.

521
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,963
One question.

522
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,100
I needed a pet.
Is that so weird?

523
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,370
All right,

524
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,278
everybody who's doing what
you're doing to each other,

525
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,941
stop immediately, or
you will be arrested.

526
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,083
Hey. Hey.

527
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,816
Did you get anything?

528
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,289
Uh, so,

529
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,916
this was cast by
a woman, clearly,

530
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,621
although the muggles
didn't know that.

531
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,260
They said she was talking
about the loss of magic,

532
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,265
and the need for wonder.

533
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,891
Okay, did you get a name, or...

534
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,595
No, just that she was asking

535
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,447
where the nearest
building was to jump off of.

536
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,905
The old post office on 58th.

537
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,064
How do you know that?

538
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,386
Abandoned building, easy
roof access, and great views.

539
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,969
It was the number
one midtown spot

540
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,275
when I was into that kind
of thing as a possibility.

541
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,470
Greetings, Your Majesty.

542
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,537
Father Poe.

543
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,942
I understand you have
a bit of a monster issue.

544
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,443
I'd be happy to send
my navy, but first,

545
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,023
I'm looking for something.

546
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:10,860
A golden key.

547
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,365
It can't be that easy.

548
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,204
I'm sorry, Sire,

549
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,040
it's impossible for
me to give you this.

550
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,673
Oh, well...

551
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,642
As your new monarch,

552
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,318
I'm afraid I have to insist.

553
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,159
It's the only thing
keeping us alive.

554
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,656
It's coming back!

555
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,470
Holy shit.

556
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,338
Call 911.

557
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,404
Wait, are you... Q!

558
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,846
Q, what are you...

559
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,653
Majesty, I urge you.

560
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Hide!

561
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,379
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

562
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,577
Quentin?

563
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,808
Professor Lipson?

564
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,798
Hey, it's nice to see you, um...

565
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,114
Stop!

566
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,981
Oh, Jesus. It's Lipson.

567
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,909
Who?

568
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,950
Please.

569
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,444
You don't wanna do this.

570
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:21,025
Not after you just made
such beautiful magic.

571
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,287
Magic is dead.

572
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,355
No, but it's not, and you
proved that today, right?

573
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,161
With Mayakovsky's battery.

574
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,162
It's not his.

575
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,430
It's mine.

576
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,438
Yes, of course, of course it is.

577
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,440
Do you think that he
could make this without me?

578
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,306
Where do you think he got
the living metal in Antarctica?

579
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,039
Me. Me.

580
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,513
Everything he asked
for, I gave him everything.

581
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,345
The fucking bastard!

582
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,816
Yes, God, totally.

583
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,579
I told him...

584
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,146
I was the one that told him
that this day would come,

585
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,316
that it wouldn't last.

586
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,518
And that was so smart.

587
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,802
We all... We
should've seen that.

588
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:55,866
And then he walks in there

589
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,193
with that fucking
slut, that whore!

590
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,298
Calling her his wife?

591
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,527
The goddamn world is ending!

592
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,330
And all we have is each other,

593
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,066
and he does this to me now!

594
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,142
Look, he is the worst, and
he got what he deserved,

595
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,177
but I get what you
did. You were raging

596
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,544
against the dying of the light.

597
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,473
Yes. Yes.

598
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,081
We really didn't know
how good we had it, did we?

599
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,812
We whined and complained

600
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,189
about everything
that magic couldn't do

601
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,490
because we couldn't see
that a world without it was

602
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,023
dark and mean and pointless.

603
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,802
Yeah. Exactly.

604
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,396
Whoa, no, no! Please, please.

605
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,906
It was me. It was
my fault, okay?

606
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,408
And I'm going to fix it.

607
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,820
Look, we've already...
We've started...

608
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,336
You can't fix this, Quentin.

609
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,413
It's over. It's over.

610
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,812
This. This is all there is.

611
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,909
And I used it to
give joy to sick kids,

612
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,683
and to bring love to strangers
who were dead inside.

613
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,520
And you know
what? I hope he sees.

614
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,925
I hope he sees and
knows that I used all of it

615
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,224
for something that
he would never use!

616
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,599
Look, he got what
he deserved, okay?

617
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,567
Honestly, I think that it was
brilliant turning him into a bear.

618
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,536
A bear? What? What
are you talking about?

619
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,903
In the bar, when you met him,

620
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,045
and he brought Emily,
and he gave you that,

621
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,206
and you turned him in...

622
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,602
God, I don't know what
you're talking about.

623
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,758
Quentin, let me go!

624
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,652
Let me go!

625
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,061
Quentin!

626
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,641
Yeah, then we
lost it on Madison.

627
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,739
I still think it went
into that falafel place.

628
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,509
No, you were hungry.

629
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,779
So was he.

630
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,650
And it was a
vegan falafel place,

631
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,349
so, herbivore. Logic. Whatever.

632
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,650
Hello?

633
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,252
He's what? Where?

634
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,823
Okay, not to be a
cold-hearted bastard,

635
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,527
but I'm a cold-hearted bastard.

636
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,070
The battery?

637
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,702
Well, that's just unfair.

638
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,903
There's something that...

639
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,772
I told Lipson that I
thought it was great

640
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,545
that she turned
Mayakovsky into a bear,

641
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,411
and she had no idea
what I was talking about.

642
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,149
Well, yeah, because
she's insane.

643
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:37,949
Well, I just,

644
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,958
I don't think that she did it.

645
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,655
Then who did?

646
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,959
Someone else at the bar.

647
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,895
Who had another battery?

648
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,827
Yeah, but is...

649
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,959
Oh, God.

650
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,467
What...

651
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,753
Sorry, Officer.

652
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,831
Our friend's cat was sick

653
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:21,662
and exploded.

654
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,901
You know, like they do.

655
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,348
Is it dead?

656
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,755
It can't be killed.

657
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,951
How do you know?

658
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,093
She's right.

659
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,527
It's a shadow bat.

660
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,261
It's not really alive,
so it can't be killed.

661
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,764
We have them in the Fairy Realm.

662
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,035
Husband.

663
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,901
No. No!

664
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,743
He didn't get inside.
I couldn't save him.

665
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,549
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,182
Now you see.

667
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,953
I can never give you this key.

668
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,125
Hey, open the door.

669
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,930
We know you have the battery...

670
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,596
What happened?

671
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,364
You're not as
quick as your friend.

672
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,472
She took it.

673
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,633
Alice?

674
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,001
Kady.

675
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,954
She's the only one
who hits that hard.

676
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,489
Wait, you had the
battery the whole time?

677
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,513
Of course I did.

678
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,638
So, wait, so,

679
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,445
you turned Mayakovsky
into a bear? Mmm-hmm.

680
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,644
Isn't he your husband?

681
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,618
Which is the only
reason I didn't kill him.

682
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,945
Where's Kady?

683
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,456
I kinda missed it

684
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,493
'cause I was on the ground.

685
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,754
Bleeding.

686
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,464
My child,

687
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,090
you do not grieve alone.

688
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,169
I, the Father, grieve with you.

689
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,635
You do not des...

690
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:07,964
Get away from him!

691
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,039
Please.

692
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,803
Tell her not to do that.

693
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:11,875
Fray!

694
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,774
Pardon me for one second.

695
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,070
You sure?

696
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,202
I've seen the wounds
the shadow bat makes.

697
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,303
The fangs are serrated.

698
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,236
The wounds are messy.

699
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,807
And much...

700
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,181
Bigger.

701
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,883
And as the daughter
of a blademaker,

702
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,510
I'm telling you

703
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,078
a blade killed the villager.

704
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,823
Okay, so I'll go to Brakebills.

705
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,206
Q, you try the restaurant
where she works,

706
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,892
and Josh, you wanna
take her apartment?

707
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,024
Look, I just need to know
the action plan, okay?

708
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,264
If I do find her, do I,
what, just grab the battery?

709
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,501
Even if she's using it
at that exact moment

710
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,631
to save Penny?

711
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,903
And even if saving Penny
means the battery's dead?

712
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,720
Or the battery has
enough juice to save Penny

713
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,664
and help us, she just
doesn't want me to have it.

714
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,773
I mean, which I totally
get, from her perspective.

715
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,748
Only I'm not her, I'm me,

716
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,877
and I'm trying to fix the whole
fuckness that is the universe.

717
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,548
Look, let's just find
her, and then we'll

718
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,852
figure out all the moral Jenga.

719
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,026
Said he needed to see you.

720
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,872
I tried to get him to come
inside, but he wouldn't.

721
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,262
Thanks, Maggie.

722
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,764
Should I call an ambulance? No.

723
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,909
No, no, no. Thanks.
I can handle this.

724
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,196
Okay. PENNY: Hi.

725
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,499
God, what the fuck, dude?

726
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,864
I just...

727
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,073
I felt like it was
my time, and I...

728
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,603
I just wanted to be
with you when I...

729
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,575
No, no.

730
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,112
No, you're not going to, okay?

731
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,948
Holy shit. Yeah.

732
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,313
Come on.

733
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,721
Let's get you out of here.

734
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,698
What is the meaning of this?

735
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,532
Excellent question.

736
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,241
What is the meaning of this?

737
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,006
I have an idea.

738
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,078
Let's test it out.

739
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,017
Bingle?

740
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,746
Kill him.

741
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,257
Or...

742
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,785
Do it.

743
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,824
Do what?

744
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,867
One more word
and you'll be dead.

745
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,161
But I'll still have
the key, so...

746
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,105
Do it.

747
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,070
Guys!

748
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,769
Your new king
commands you to stay put!

749
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,230
Gee, Father.

750
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,174
Weren't you scared?

751
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,379
It's illusion magic.

752
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,174
He's been using it
to make you all afraid.

753
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,349
There is no monster.

754
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,756
Well, I guess he
kinda qualifies,

755
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,021
because how many of you

756
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,229
have died at the
hands of your priest

757
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,761
to make him your
uncontested leader and hero?

758
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,002
My friend lost his life.

759
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,273
Reminds me of what a
good friend once told me.

760
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,313
What's the difference
between a hero and a moron?

761
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,381
One bad decision.

762
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,422
No.

763
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,054
No! No!

764
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,860
He's lying.

765
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,666
He's lying to you!

766
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,759
No! No!

767
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,104
No!

768
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,455
I know you're behind me.

769
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,063
Thank you, by the way.

770
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,408
We wouldn't have been
able to figure it out without...

771
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,525
You didn't do it.

772
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,325
Do what?

773
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,370
What you told my
queen you came to do...

774
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,935
Collect taxes... You
just came for that key.

775
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,164
Why?

776
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,175
It's gold.

777
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,945
And magic.

778
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,344
Maybe the only magic anywhere.

779
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,382
What could be more
valuable than that?

780
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm not sure I believe you.

781
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,620
And I can't believe I
finally get to say this.

782
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,188
Don't talk back to
your father and me.

783
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,092
That felt nice, didn't it?

784
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,827
I am here to assure
that... My turn.

785
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
Go to your room.

786
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,375
We're a family.

787
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,105
Well, we are certainly
fucked up enough to be.

788
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,041
Holy shit.

789
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,049
Hey.

790
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,413
Help you?
