The Lamprey.

4

Right, so the first quest

50
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,259
is in Fillory.

51
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,297

52
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,659
Yeah, but we should
be there with him.

53

JOSH:
Hell, yeah, we should.

54

Quests are not a solo op,

55
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,871
and thanks to Dean Fogg and the
world's biggest FedEx bill,

56
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,304
we've got the clock.

57
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,099
So all we need is magic.

58
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,607
Which is where you come in,
right?

59
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,840
Wrong. I mean,
that would be like trying

60
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,142
to power a Ferrari
on a drop of unleaded.

61
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,683
So we power this puppy how?

62
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,312
Mayakovsky.
Yes.

63
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,446
Can I focus on something I
don't wanna punch in the face?

64
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,546
He had four batteries
in Brakebills South.

65
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,215
He said
that's all he had, but...

66
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,987
He's a lying drunk,
so of course he had more.

67
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,992
And he's been MIA
since magic got shut down.

68
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,033
And if he's roaming the earth,
he's using them.

69
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,998
If only to scam chicks.

70
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,331
Any ideas where?

71
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,529
No.

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,565
I mean, magic might be dead,
but...

73
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,205

started buzzing

188

on this drunk Russian guy

he'd always loved me

to know the action plan, okay?

Even if she's using it
at that exact moment

764

to save Penny?

765
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,714
And even if saving Penny
means the battery's dead?

766
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,482
Or the battery has enough
juice to save Penny

767

doesn't want me to have it.
